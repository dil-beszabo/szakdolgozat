Full text: Angel Sivado tries to move people from the streets to permanent housing. A new law makes helping her clients more of a challenge.
There are many ways to know a city -- its front porches, its restaurants, its tourist traps -- but Angel Sivado knows Louisville, Ky., by way of its homeless camps.
Sivado knows every overpass where somebody sleeps on a worn piece of cardboard, every gas station with a tent tucked behind its dumpster. She knows the signs invisible to others: clearings in the woods behind a strip mall, abandoned shopping carts, smoke rising from campfires.
Every morning at 7:45, Sivado, 51, an outreach worker for a homeless services agency called St. John Center, drives from one homeless camp to the next. She carries jerky and Pringles, Narcan and clean socks. Many of Louisville's homeless people use her office as their home address. They confide in Sivado, who greets everyone with her voice like syrup: "Hi, friend!"
On a sticky afternoon in July, Sivado visited one of her clients, Jessica Miller. Since the start of this year, Miller has been working on an application for a housing voucher, but right now she lives in a tattered orange tent behind the dumpster of a Thorntons convenience store. One of her legs was amputated after she got sepsis, and her prosthetic was stolen by another homeless person. During the day, she sits in a wheelchair with a rain-weathered cardboard sign: "Homeless anything helps thank you <3."
Miller, who is 42, said she fled an abusive relationship more than six years ago and found herself homeless. She is one of nearly 600 people who were homeless and not living in shelters when Louisville last counted its homeless population in 2024, a more than 300 percent increase from before the pandemic.
Sivado grabbed a water bottle and bag of apples from the back seat of her van and took them to Miller, who was sitting in her tent. "I'm getting attacked by rats," she said, gesturing at a heap of trash collecting near her tent.
"I can handle it," she continued. "But it's the way I'm treated. I'm homeless, not contagious."
Miller said customers leaving the convenience store had been laughing at her and taking pictures. She recently heard a Thorntons employee ask the manager where Miller got the money for cigarettes, and the manager mimed oral sex. She began to cry.
Wiping her eyes with her fingers, Miller asked Sivado about something she had heard recently from a police officer. The officer had given her a verbal warning: Find somewhere new to sleep. There was a new law that prohibited sleeping outside. She could be fined, or go to jail.
Sivado knew about this law. In April, the Kentucky Legislature made unsanctioned public camping illegal, one of at least three states to ban homeless camping this year, on top of nearly 60 localities that did the same. Then in June, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling that protected bans on homeless encampments. Sivado and her colleagues had begun visiting sites in Louisville that were marked for clearing to ask the people sleeping there if they knew where they would go.
"I hope they don't arrest you," Sivado said.
"It seems like it should be illegal," Miller replied. "I can't get somewhere else like a normal person." She gestured toward her missing leg.
"You're getting ready to go home," said Sivado. She brought her thumb and index finger together. "You're this close. Let's get you home."
The Cicero Blueprint
For most of his life, John Hodgson had no plans to run for office. He moved to Louisville nearly 40 years ago for a job at UPS headquarters. He relished being part of Louisville's growth, celebrating the rising number of tourists arriving each year for bourbon tours and derby parties.
Hodgson retired in 2016. During the early months of the pandemic, he grew disturbed by what he viewed as overreach by Kentucky's Democratic governor. Hodgson, a Republican, decided to run for the State Legislature, winning a seat in 2022.
Crime was the top problem that Hodgson heard about from constituents in his district, a leafy Louisville suburb. Neighbors told him they did not feel safe downtown. Some felt uneasy about the homeless people sleeping on the streets and panhandling outside restaurants.
Hodgson set out to study what other cities were doing on crime and homelessness. He read the book "San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities," by Michael Shellenberger.
He visited Los Angeles, which had not at that time banned homeless encampments, as well as San Diego, which had, and concluded: "When people are allowed to live on the street untreated, they spiral."
Hodgson plunged into the issue at a moment when homelessness, especially street homelessness, was rising sharply. A growing number of policymakers and businesspeople argue that cities have been too lenient in their approach to homeless populations. They maintain that encampments are dangerous to those in and around them.
Others argue that criminalizing street camping will not deter it, and will instead saddle homeless people with bench warrants and unpayable fines. "People are not going to disappear. They are going to have to sleep somewhere else," said Dennis Culhane, a social scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on homelessness. A study this year found no significant correlation between ordinances criminalizing homeless activities and a long-term reduction in homelessness.
At the front of the campaign to prohibit street camping is the Cicero Institute, which was created by Joe Lonsdale, one of the founders of the data behemoth Palantir Technologies. Lonsdale, who built his career in San Francisco, decided that its leaders' policies on homelessness were misguided. He criticized "housing first," a bipartisan approach that has steered federal policy for more than two decades and gives people access to housing without first requiring treatment for mental illness or addiction.
Cicero, which is based in Texas, released its own platform, which proposes defunding housing first programs, reallocating those funds and banning unauthorized camping. Since 2021, the institute has assisted with legislation on homelessness introduced in Missouri, Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida. Cicero researchers argue that housing first programs and unauthorized encampments tacitly encourage homeless people to leave addiction untreated.
"We need to be willing to push people into shelter, push people into treatment," said Devon Kurtz, who leads research on homelessness at Cicero.
"If someone is so severely mentally ill that they're living in an encampment full of toxic trash, they're extremely vulnerable -- jail is better than that," he continued. "If the risk is dying, I'm willing to say jail is better than dying."
Hodgson felt similarly. Stories from his own life seemed to bolster this case. He taught in a Sunday school and saw one of his students become addicted to alcohol and drugs. "When he would get arrested, he would stop the drug problem, go to class, go to Bible study," Hodgson said. "I talked to his dad, who said, 'It's a sad thing to say, but my boy was better off in prison."'
Last year, Hodgson and six of his colleagues began assembling a bill, the Safer Kentucky Act, which would increase penalties for many nonviolent crimes and prohibit public camping. Hodgson contacted a friend who worked at the Cicero Institute.
With assistance from Cicero, the Kentucky legislators drafted provisions that would make unauthorized camping carry potential fines and jail time.
The bill passed 75 to 23. It was vetoed by Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, but the Legislature overrode the veto, and the Safer Kentucky Act went into effect in July. Lonsdale celebrated it. "We worked hard this legislative session to help states combat the growing homelessness crisis," he wrote on his blog. "It paid off."
Those efforts landed on the streets of Louisville this summer.
City at a Crossroads
Sivado was getting into her car after visiting Miller that Tuesday in July when she spotted two Thorntons employees making their way toward the tent.
Sivado leaped out of the car and rushed over. "I'm from St. John Center," she said.
The two store employees, who declined to give their names, said officials from the city had fined Thorntons $ 100 when they saw the tents by the dumpster. They said that under Kentucky's new law, businesses could be held liable for the homeless people staying on their properties. The employees said Miller and her boyfriend had to leave.
"We only have until the 6th of August to get them out," one employee said. "Or we'll be cited again."
Sivado explained that outreach workers had been assisting Miller for months. They had finally secured her housing voucher over the summer and now just had to find a housing unit that was wheelchair-accessible. "We're just waiting on the inspection," she pleaded.
The second employee shrugged, saying, "We already sent this up to corporate."
Sivado was shaking. As the Thorntons employees turned away, she began singing under her breath: "Praise you, Jesus," she murmured.
Seated back in the car, she slowly exhaled. She acknowledged that there was little the store employees could do. But she ached for Miller: "There is not much in the world that frustrates me," Sivado said, "except when people abuse our clients."
Even before the Safer Kentucky Act made camping a misdemeanor, the City of Louisville had been dismantling homeless camps. When Craig Greenberg, a businessman who founded an upscale hotel chain, became mayor in 2023, those efforts accelerated. The city cleared 19 encampments within his first seven months in office, compared with nine in the months leading up to his administration.
Scruffy tent groupings were not a good look for a city on the make. Louisville attracted a record $ 4.2 billion in tourist spending in 2023. Greenberg had campaigned on a commitment to public safety. For years, the city faced interlocking crises, including the police killing of Breonna Taylor and the ensuing protests. During his campaign, Greenberg was the target of an assassination attempt, when a man walked into his office and shot at him. Greenberg was unharmed, but after the attack, he doubled down on a promise to curb the city's disorder, which was especially visible in its encampments.
"We've had shootings, we've had stabbings, we've had rapes within these camps just as I've been mayor," Greenberg said. "The long-term solution is more shelter and more services, and that's what we're building toward."
His administration has worked with a nonprofit to open a campus with a new family shelter and affordable housing project, which they're aiming to have fully operating within three years.
The questions Greenberg faces -- whether to dismantle camps and, if so, how -- have dogged mayors across the country. Grants Pass, a city in Oregon, began enforcing prohibitions on sleeping outside nearly a decade ago and faced a legal challenge from a homeless woman who accrued $ 5,000 in penalties. The case wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in June that cities are allowed to ban homeless camping.
Had the Supreme Court ruling gone the other way, lawyers in Louisville said, they would have tried to challenge the Safer Kentucky Act.
One public defender in Louisville, Ryan Dischinger, worries about people kicked out of camps with nowhere to go; Louisville's shelter beds can accommodate only two-thirds of the unsheltered population. On top of that, people who are arrested often lose belongings, including voucher paperwork -- which could set them back in the path toward housing.
"We could see a huge wave of people who are homeless being introduced, potentially for the first time, into the criminal justice system," Dischinger said.
Cat and Mouse
Each day, Sivado and her colleagues drive around Louisville -- visiting gas stations, traipsing through the woods -- trying to keep straight all the people who need them. The camp clearings complicate their work. Now, they spend days tracking down clients who have had to move.
In late July, Sivado was driving by an Outback Steakhouse. Nearby was a clearing in the woods where a camp had been marked for dismantling. She parked her car and walked gingerly onto a path littered with needles and syringes. She pushed through a tangle of vines and arrived at a large tent, which had been made by stringing a tarp to a tree.
Inside the tent were a homeless man, Ryan Spitznagel, and his wife. Sivado asked if they had seen the yellow sign on the tree nearby, which indicated that the camp was going to be cleared in mid-August.
Spitznagel nodded. "We got evicted twice. Now we're getting evicted from here," he said.
Two weeks earlier, Spitznagel and his wife had been told to leave a different campsite, in the woods behind a storage facility. His wife worked at the nearby auto plant, he said, and they had to find somewhere to sleep within walking distance of her work.
"If she's not 45 minutes early to work, she's late," he said of his wife, who was asleep in the tent. "Her dad instilled that work ethic in her."
Spitznagel said both he and his wife were veterans and had cycled in and out of drug addiction treatment. A colleague of Sivado's had connected them to the local veterans affairs office and was helping them apply for a housing voucher.
Like so many homeless people in Louisville, Spitznagel felt he was playing a cat-and-mouse game. He and his wife moved, and then were told to move again. At the same time, the outreach workers trying to get them into permanent housing were having a hard time locating them.
It was a rainy morning, and everybody Sivado came across seemed extra distressed, so back in the car she turned on gospel music. "This one's my song!" she exclaimed, beginning to belt. "The Lord is my shepherd, he goes before me, defender behind me, I won't fear."
'It Was My Home'
Sivado's work is soul-nourishing and depleting all at once. Even after her clients secure housing vouchers, getting them into an apartment can take months. This year, Kentucky's Legislature passed another law that would, in effect, allow landlords to refuse people using vouchers for rent.
All of it makes Sivado feel that the state is putting up barriers in a job already full of them.
In early August, police officers woke Miller up in her tent outside Thorntons and told her she had 15 minutes to leave. It took time for her to get into her wheelchair, so she had to leave behind her food, belongings and tent.
"I'm left with dirty clothes on, and that's it," she said afterward, adding: "It doesn't look like a house, but it was my home."
Two months later came better news: There was an apartment whose landlord had accepted Miller's voucher and built her a wheelchair ramp. Sivado packed up a box with pots, pans, an air mattress and blankets. The night before the move, Sivado drove by Miller's new temporary campsite.
Miller knew she should be feeling ecstatic, but it was hard to shake her fear. She was comforted by Sivado, her voice mellifluous, who mustered a tone of confidence as she told Miller: "This is your time. Let's get you inside."

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — There are many ways to know a city — its front porches, its restaurants, its tourist traps — but Angel Sivado knows Louisville, Kentucky, by way of its homeless camps.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He introduced ticket prices that couldn't be beat, but asked fliers to pay extra for nearly everything, including water, carry-ons and printed tickets.
Ben Baldanza, who turned a small money-losing airline called Spirit into a profit-making powerhouse through a combination of ultralow prices, bare-bones service, outrageous marketing and a no-apologies approach to customer complaints, died on Tuesday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 62.
Scott McCartney, his co-host on the podcast "Airlines Confidential," confirmed the death from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
Spirit was already a low-cost airline when Mr. Baldanza arrived in 2005, serving first as chief operating officer and then, a year later, becoming chief executive. The airline had lost $ 79 million the year before, and Mr. Baldanza, an industry veteran with a reputation for finding clever ways to cut costs, was given carte blanche to slash away.
Rather than trim at the edges, he took a radical approach: what he called the "bare fare."
Passengers would pay a basic price for the flight and then shell out for virtually everything else, from printed boarding passes ( $ 10) to water bottles ( $ 3) and carry-on bags ( $ 35 if the tag was printed at home, $ 50 at the airport).
On board, they found no business class, no back-of-the-seat movie screens and no Wi-Fi; the seats didn't recline, and legroom was minimal. To bring in more money, seemingly every square inch of space was available for advertising, including the flight attendants' aprons and the airsickness bags.
Mr. Baldanza, an eager, media-friendly evangelist for his airline, touted the resulting ultralow fares, which averaged just $ 75 in 2013, down from an already low $ 94 in 2008. He called Spirit a "dollar store in the sky" and its aircraft "buses with wings," and he made no apologies for meager service or miserly fees.
"We care about the thing that customers tell us they care the most about, and that's offering the lowest possible fares," he told The New York Times in 2013, a year in which Spirit made $ 177.5 million.
Under Mr. Baldanza, Spirit promoted itself with audacious, often risqué ads. In 2011, following the revelation that Representative Anthony D. Weiner, Democrat of New York, had engaged in lewd online behavior, Spirit offered a "Weiner sale," touting $ 9 fares that were "too HARD to resist."
Fliers flocked to Spirit, even as it regularly ranked worst among airlines in customer satisfaction.
Mr. Baldanza refused to back down. Instead, he ran a "Hug the Haters" campaign, offering 8,000 frequent-flier miles to people who submitted their rants against the airline to its website.
"No one goes to Chick-fil-A and complains they can't get a burger. And people shouldn't come to Spirit if they want lots of legroom," he told The Wall Street Journal in 2015. "Judge us for who we are."
Among Spirit's most infuriating policies was its refusal to offer refunds. In 2012, a Florida Marine veteran named Jerry Meekins, who was dying of esophageal cancer but had booked one last flight to see his family in New Jersey, learned that he was too ill to fly. He requested a refund, but Spirit refused.
His story got out, and soon some 40,000 people had joined a boycott of Spirit on Facebook. Eventually the company relented, giving Mr. Meekins his money and making a $ 5,000 donation to the Wounded Warrior Project.
"Sometimes," Mr. Baldanza told reporters, "we make mistakes."
Basil Ben Baldanza Jr. was born on Dec. 3, 1961, in Rome, N.Y., in the central part of the state. His father served in the Navy and later worked for the Air Force as a civilian. His mother, Norma (Guaspari) Baldanza, managed the home.
Ben's first love was music -- he played trombone, and for a time aspired to be in a band -- but he ended up getting a degree in policy studies and economics from Syracuse University in 1984, followed by a master's in public administration from Princeton in 1986.
That same year he went to work for American Airlines, where he helped Robert Crandall, the chief executive, put in place new ideas like frequent-flier rewards and a hub-and-spoke system of routes. He also worked for Continental, Northwest, UPS, TACA and US Airways before coming to Spirit.
While Spirit remained alone in its extreme approach to pricing, Mr. Baldanza's strategy echoed throughout the industry. Spirit was the first to charge for checked luggage; other airlines soon followed. And over the last decade, most carriers have adopted some form of no-frills "basic economy" fare.
The company grew rapidly under Mr. Baldanza, adding more routes and scores of planes. But eventually the market decided he had pushed too far, and in 2015 Spirit's share price fell by more than 50 percent, to a low of $ 33.77 from a high of $ 88.25.
Mr. Baldanza resigned in January 2016. He was immediately replaced by Robert Fornaro, who promised to improve customer service and downplay the company's bad-boy image.
Mr. Baldanza married Marcia Moshier in 1987. She survives him, along with their son, Enzo; Mr. Baldanza's sisters, Lia Farrington and Judy Looker; and his brother, Joe.
After leaving Spirit, Mr. Baldanza joined a number of corporate boards, taught part time at George Mason University, collected board games (he had some 1,700) and, in 2019, joined Mr. McCartney to start a podcast.
This year, he received the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, among the highest honors in the aviation industry: Past recipients include John Glenn, Neil Armstrong and Mr. Baldanza's former mentor, Mr. Crandall.
Mr. Baldanza was diagnosed with A.L.S. in 2022. As the disease progressed, he began to lose his power of speech, and he sought a solution that would allow him to remain on the podcast. He found one in an innovative artificial intelligence program that used hundreds of hours of recordings to recreate his voice, including his occasional sarcasm.
"It's fantastic," he told ABC 27, an affiliate in Pennsylvania, in March. "It allows me to speak like I used to."

With Pact, Union Ends Boeing Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: About 33,000 workers at the aerospace manufacturer had been on strike for nearly two months, having rejected two earlier contract offers.
Members of Boeing's largest union approved a new contract on Monday, ending a weekslong strike that was one of the country's most financially damaging work stoppages in decades.
The contract was endorsed by 59 percent of those voting, according to the union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union represents about 33,000 workers, most of whom make commercial airplanes in the Seattle area. More than three-quarters of the members voted on the contract.
The union said its members, who had resoundingly voted down two previous contract offers from Boeing, could return to work as soon as Wednesday but must be back by next Tuesday. The strike began on Sept. 13, after the union rejected the company's first proposal.
"You stood strong, you stood tall and you won. This is a victory," said Jon Holden, the president of District 751 of the machinists union, which represents the vast majority of the workers covered by the contract.
The new contract will raise wages more than 43 percent cumulatively over the next four years, an improvement over the two previous offers. The first proposal would have raised wages just over 27 percent.
Union leaders and Boeing had urged the workers to approve the deal. The union's leadership had warned that future offers from the company could have worse terms than this proposal.
In a statement, Boeing's chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said he was "pleased" that the agreement had been reached. "While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team," he said. "We will only move forward by listening and working together."
Mr. Ortberg, who joined the company in August, is trying to restore Boeing's reputation and business after multiple setbacks in recent years. Last month, he announced plans to cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10 percent of Boeing's global work force, and make other changes.
Boeing recently reported that it lost more than $ 6.1 billion in the three months that ended in September. Last week, it raised more than $ 21 billion by selling shares to investors, an effort to strengthen its financial position and stave off the loss of its investment-grade credit rating. Moody's Ratings and Fitch Ratings both described the fund-raising as a positive step, but said they were still reviewing whether to downgrade Boeing's credit rating to "junk" status, which could raise its borrowing costs.
The contract talks were contentious because workers had grown frustrated with the company's management. Many were still angry over labor negotiations a decade ago, when the union agreed to let Boeing freeze a pension plan that included guaranteed monthly retirement payouts. Even though the company was unlikely to agree to restore that pension, workers pushed for better benefits elsewhere in the contract to make up for that concession.
Officials in the Biden administration had closely monitored the negotiations, which began in March. After talks broke down last month, officials helped to bring the two sides back to the table. Both Boeing and the union thanked the acting labor secretary, Julie Su, who made three trips to Seattle, for helping to facilitate the discussions that resulted in the deal.
In a statement, President Biden congratulated Boeing and the union. "Good contracts benefit workers, businesses and consumers," he said.
In addition to the increase in wages, the new contract includes a $ 12,000 ratification bonus, which is four times as much as the bonus in the initial offer. The deal calls for improved retirement benefits and a commitment by Boeing to build its next commercial airplane in the Seattle region.
"We've never gotten that before. They've never given us a commitment for an airplane program before it's launched, before it's designed," Mr. Holden said at a news conference after the results were announced.
Boeing has said the average annual pay of machinists will rise to more than $ 119,000 by the end of the contract, up from nearly $ 76,000 today, after those raises and other benefits are taken into account.
The walkout's financial toll rivals ones involving workers at General Motors in 1998 and at UPS in 1997, according to an analysis by Anderson Economic Group, a research and consulting firm in Michigan. Boeing had suffered at least $ 5.5 billion in lost earnings in the first six weeks of the strike, according to the firm. The total economic fallout, including its effect on Boeing's suppliers and customers, was more than $ 9.6 billion.
In response to the strike, Boeing took several cost-cutting measures, including pausing some spending and issuing temporary furloughs for tens of thousands of other employees. Some of the company's suppliers have taken similar measures.
The contract replaces a 2008 agreement, reached after a two-month strike, that was modified and extended multiple times since. That strike contributed to a decline in Boeing's revenue of about $ 6.4 billion that year because the company delivered 104 fewer planes than expected.
Most of the striking workers were based at factories in the Seattle area, where Boeing makes several commercial airplanes, including its most popular jet, the 737 Max. The Max accounts for three-fourths of the 6,200 planes Boeing has on order, but production is far short of the company's target because of a crisis that began in January when a panel blew off a Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight.
That episode renewed concerns about the quality and safety of Boeing planes five years after two fatal crashes involving the Max. In response to the panel blowout, the Federal Aviation Administration capped Max production to 38 planes per month. Production was well below that number before the strike.

There Are Ways to Keep Autocrats Out of Power. Why Don't We Use Them?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Democratic self-rule contains a paradox. It is a system premised on openness and competition. Any ambitious party or politician should have a shot at running for office and winning. But what if a major candidate seeks to dismantle that very system?
America confronts this problem today. Donald Trump poses a clear threat to American democracy. He was the first president in U.S. history to refuse to accept defeat, and he illegally attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Now, on the brink of returning to the White House, Mr. Trump is forthrightly telling Americans that if he wins, he plans to bend, if not break, our democracy.
Mr. Trump tells us he plans to prosecute his political rivals, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney and other members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee; deploy the army to repress protest; and order the deportation of 15 million to 20 million people, including some legal immigrants.
We have been studying democratic crisis and authoritarianism for 30 years. Between the two of us, we have written five books on those subjects. We can think of few major national candidates for office in any democracy since World War II who have been this openly authoritarian.
The view that Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to democracy is shared by Gen. Mark Milley, his onetime chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called him "fascist to the core," and by his former chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, who described him as a fascist who prefers dictatorship to democracy.
How could such an openly authoritarian figure have a coin flip's chance of returning to the presidency? Why have so many of our democracy's defenses seemingly broken down, and which, if any, remain?
We spent the last year researching how democracies can protect themselves from authoritarian threats from within. We have found five strategies that pro-democratic forces around the world have employed. None offer foolproof protection (no democracy could enjoy foolproof protection and remain a democracy), and some of them come with important drawbacks. But our research suggests that in the face of imminent extremist threats, these strategies are the best available.
The traditional American response to extremism is laissez-faire which makes it almost odd to call it a strategy. We rely on the self-correcting power of electoral competition. The belief is that all opinions should compete freely, allowing the marketplace of ideas, or what John Stuart Mill called "the collision of adverse opinions," to play out. If we let all candidates compete, the thinking goes, good ideas and candidates will ultimately beat out the bad ones.
Electoral competition is, of course, essential to democracy. But a laissez-faire approach has two important limitations. First, in the United States, competition is distorted by an 18th-century institution, the Electoral College, that allows election losers to win power. In one sense, the electoral marketplace worked in 2016 the way it is theoretically supposed to: More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Mr. Trump. But the Electoral College permitted an authoritarian figure who won fewer votes to become president.
In addition, history shows us that electoral competition alone is insufficient to fend off extremist threats. Good ideas don't always win out. And candidates seeking to subvert democracy don't always lose. In the past quarter-century alone, leaders like Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Kais Saied in Tunisia and Nayib Bukele in El Salvador have won decisive electoral majorities -- and then used their elected offices to undermine fair competition, making it nearly impossible to remove them from office democratically.
Yet democracies are not helpless. There are four other strategies for fending off authoritarian threats from within. One of these is a far more muscular approach, known as militant or defensive democracy. Born in West Germany as a response to Europe's democratic failures in the 1930s, the militant democracy approach empowers public authorities to wield the rule of law against antidemocratic forces. Haunted by the experience of Hitler's rise to power via the ballot box, West German constitutional designers created legal and administrative procedures that allowed the state to restrict and even outlaw "anti-constitutional" speech, groups and parties. In the 1950s, these tools were used to ban both a Nazi successor party and the Communist Party. Today, German authorities are investigating the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.
Obviously, there are significant drawbacks and risks to empowering public officials to bar candidates or parties from elections. Candidate disqualification distorts electoral competition and restricts voter choice. Worse, the tools of militant democracy are easily abused by politicians seeking to sideline their rivals, as has occurred with some frequency in Latin America.
Nevertheless, most contemporary democracies employ elements of militant democracy. In South Korea, the Constitutional Court banned the Unified Progressive Party in 2014 because it deemed the party's pro-North Korean views to be antidemocratic. In Brazil, the Supreme Electoral Court has the authority to bar politicians convicted of corruption and other crimes from running for office, and a 2021 democracy protection law made it a crime -- punishable by up to 12 years in prison -- to attempt to overthrow a democratic government. Last year a former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who, like Mr. Trump, tried to discredit and then overturn an election, was barred from public office for eight years.
The United States has a tool on the books for disqualifying anti-constitutional candidates: Section III of the 14th Amendment disallows former public officials who have "engaged in insurrection or rebellion" from holding office. Intended to bar Confederate leaders from public office, Section III might have been used to disqualify Mr. Trump from the ballot -- as Colorado's Supreme Court ruled in late 2023 with regard to its state's primary ballot. Earlier this year, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, barring congressional legislation, the 14th Amendment could not be used to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot. With that decision, for good or ill, America chose to forgo the path of militant democracy.
A third approach to defending democracy is partisan gatekeeping. In the absence of legal tools to block extremist threats, the responsibility for fending off such threats falls to political parties. In a healthy democracy, party leaders police their own ranks, expelling antidemocratic elements or refusing to nominate extremists or demagogues for public office.
American parties were effective gatekeepers throughout the 20th century. In the early 1920s, Henry Ford, the plain-spoken founder of Ford Motor Company, who was admired by many Americans but whose extremism and antisemitism were embraced by Hitler and the Nazis, considered running for president as a Democrat. Early polls showed him leading the pack of potential candidates. But Democratic leaders never seriously considered him. Finding the party's gates closed, Ford abandoned his presidential aspirations.
Half a century ago, Republican leaders engaged in self-policing when they joined in congressional investigations into wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon. When Mr. Nixon's abuse of power was brought to light, key Republican leaders supported impeachment. Their actions shifted public opinion in important ways. It was not until a group of Republican lawmakers came out in favor of impeachment beginning in late July 1974 that a clear majority of Americans supported Mr. Nixon's removal from office.
Today's Republican leaders have abandoned gatekeeping. Even after Mr. Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election, they protected and supported him. Had Senate Republicans voted to convict and disqualify Mr. Trump after his second impeachment, he would not be a candidate today. But they did not. And now, nearly all Republican officeholders support Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, despite having witnessed, firsthand, his assault on democracy and the rule of law. Captive to an authoritarian outsider whom they should have kept out, Republican leaders now imperil, rather than defend, democracy.
When authoritarians make it onto the ballot, prodemocratic forces may turn to a fourth strategy: containment, in which politicians from across the ideological spectrum forge a broad coalition to isolate and defeat the authoritarians. Building a multiparty coalition requires that politicians temporarily set aside many of their short-term ambitions and policy goals. Such sacrifice is arguably in their long-term interest, because without democratic institutions, politicians' ability to pursue their short-term ambitions and policy goals will be undermined.
Opposition parties engaged in successful containment last year in Poland. When the illiberal Law and Justice Party government sought a third term, Poland's fragmented and ideologically diverse opposition united to defeat it. The center-right Civic Platform of the former prime minister Donald Tusk built an alliance with former Communists, greens, the conservative Peasant Party and a party led by Szymon Holownia, a television personality and presidential aspirant, to confront Law and Justice in the October 2023 parliamentary elections. The parties negotiated unified tickets -- to avoid splitting the vote -- for Senate races and, after jointly capturing a majority of seats in the election, elected a new government, putting an end to nearly a decade of democratic backsliding.
On several occasions, French parties have contained illiberal forces by forging what they call a cordon sanitaire -- a multiparty electoral coalition aimed at isolating and defeating far-right extremists. That strategy proved strikingly successful in July, when Marine Le Pen's radical right National Rally stood poised to become the largest force in Parliament after the first round of legislative elections.
In the face of an imminent far-right victory, party leaders and activists from across the spectrum, including the communists, greens, socialists, centrists and center-right Republicans, worked together, district by district, to persuade allied candidates to stand down and back a single candidacy against Ms. Le Pen's forces. Notwithstanding considerable acrimony among the parties, the strategy succeeded: The united "republican front" relegated the National Rally to third place.
In the United States, some Republican politicians have embraced a containment strategy. In a textbook example, the former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both Republicans, cooperated with Democrats on the House Jan. 6 Committee. Ms. Cheney, Mr. Kinzinger, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and a handful of other prominent Republicans took the important step of supporting Kamala Harris for president, making it clear that the threat posed by Mr. Trump outweighed any partisan loyalties or policy preferences.
But containment is hard in a polarized two-party system. Most of the prominent Republicans who have not endorsed Mr. Trump, including Senator Mitt Romney, former Vice President Mike Pence, and former President George W. Bush, declined to back Ms. Harris, opting instead to remain on the sidelines. Other leading Republicans who declared Mr. Trump unfit for office after 2020, such as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, who ran against Mr. Trump this year, now support him. As long as Republican leaders who privately view Mr. Trump as a grave danger refuse to go public, most Republican voters will remain unmoved.
That leaves a fifth strategy: societal mobilization. Democracy's last bastion of defense is civil society. When the constitutional order is under threat, influential groups and societal leaders -- chief executives, religious leaders, labor leaders and prominent retired public officials -- must speak out, reminding citizens of the red lines that democratic societies must never cross. And when politicians cross those red lines, society's most prominent voices must publicly and forcefully repudiate them.
A recent example of societal mobilization is the German public reaction to the revelation of a secret November 2023 gathering in which leaders of the far-right AfD met with neo-Nazi groups and discussed a plan for the mass deportation of immigrants, including foreign-born German citizens.
When the meeting came to light, the chairmen of the boards of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche joined top labor union leaders to condemn extremism and publicly express support for democracy, diversity and tolerance. At the same time, a network of small businesses started the Business for Democracy initiative and published a statement, signed by more than 300 business leaders, defending democracy and declaring that "human dignity is inviolable." Later, the chief executive of Siemens publicly repudiated AfD policies and declared it was time to "stand up and intervene."
The Catholic Church also responded forcefully. Representatives from all 27 German bishoprics released a statement condemning right-wing nationalism and declaring:
Right-wing extremist parties and those that place themselves close to such ideologies can be no place of political engagement for Christians. These parties are not electable. ... We call on all fellow citizens ... to clearly reject political offers from the far right.
Those public declarations took place against the backdrop of the largest street demonstrations in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The demonstrations were organized by a civil society coalition called "Hand in Hand," which encompassed 1,300 different organizations, including unions, churches, doctors' associations, refugee protection agencies and even environmental groups. Millions of citizens from across the political spectrum gathered week after week in large cities and small towns in defense of democracy. Although the AfD remains very popular in several eastern German states, its national support has declined by approximately 25 percent since the protest movement began.
When President Bolsonaro began to threaten democratic institutions in the run-up to the 2022 election, Brazilian civil society mobilized in a similar manner. Mr. Bolsonaro threatened the Supreme Court, attacked the legitimacy of the electoral system, and sought to dismantle Brazil's electronic voting system. This spurred business, religious and civic groups to mobilize, which produced a series of high-profile public letters in defense of democracy. In July 2022, the University of São Paulo Law School organized a letter in defense of democracy, which declared:
We know how to put aside minor differences in ... defense of the democratic order ... Regardless of individual electoral or partisan preferences, we call on Brazilians to remain vigilant in defending democracy and respecting election outcomes. In today's Brazil there is no room for authoritarian backsliding.
The letter was signed by former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, nine retired Supreme Court justices, and the heads of many of Brazil's largest banks and businesses. As one Brazilian political scientist put it, the letter "put the issue of democracy on the election agenda."
The following month, Brazil's leading business association, the São Paulo Federation of Industries, spearheaded a statement, signed by the country's Federation of Banks, its Chamber of Commerce and Academy of Sciences, the São Paulo bar association and more than 100 other organizations that defended democracy as "essential" to Brazil's future and affirmed an "unwavering commitment to the institutions and fundamental principles of the Rule of Law."
Finally, in October 2022, as Brazil headed into a second-round runoff between Mr. Bolsonaro and ex-President Lula da Silva, Catholic bishops from across Brazil published a "Letter to the People of God," which called on Catholics to reject Mr. Bolsonaro. The letter declared that "staying neutral is not an option when it comes to choosing between two visions for Brazil -- one democratic and the other authoritarian .... The Church does not have a political party, nor will it ever, but it does take a stand."
Mr. Bolsonaro narrowly lost the runoff, and his effort to overturn the election results met overwhelming public rejection.
In the United States, the civic response to the Trump threat has been tepid. For a moment, business leaders seemed poised to defend democracy. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, many leading U.S. businesses announced that they would not contribute to lawmakers who voted to decertify the results of the 2020 election.
Unfortunately, most of these companies -- including AT&T, Boeing, Comcast, G.E., General Motors, Home Depot, Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, UPS, Verizon and Walmart -- soon abandoned their pledge. Politico identified more than 100 companies and business groups that pledged to suspend or review donations to election deniers in early 2021. More than 70 of them resumed contributions to election deniers before the 2022 midterms. Overall, ProPublica found that at least 276 Fortune 500 companies have contributed to congressional election deniers.
As the 2024 election approached, many American chief executives publicly downplayed the threat posed by Mr. Trump. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, declared that "America is going to be fine ... no matter what happens in this election," while Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said his company would "survive and thrive" under either party's candidate. Mr. Dimon, who is considered influential in financial circles, has privately supported Ms. Harris but publicly declared himself undecided in the election's final weeks.
Although many individual business leaders have worked to defend democracy, leading national business associations like the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce remain on the sidelines, refusing to repudiate Mr. Trump's authoritarianism.
Many of America's religious leaders have also remained quiet. Most prominent evangelical leaders have either remained silent or endorsed Mr. Trump. To give one example, although Franklin Graham claimed to be above the partisan fray, he called on his followers to "Pray for former President Donald Trump. His enemies want to do everything they can to destroy him."
Catholic leaders have also failed to speak out. Although the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a public statement condemning the Jan. 6 insurrection, it was, in the words of the Catholic writer Thomas Reese, "remarkably silent" in the face of Mr. Trump's subsequent resurgence. In November 2023, the bishops conference issued an election-year document entitled "Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship," as it does every four years. The letter listed abortion as a "pre-eminent priority," but it did not mention the defense of democracy. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was sharply critical of the first Trump administration's immigration policies, but unlike the German bishops' response to the AfD's mass deportation plans, it has not publicly denounced Mr. Trump's own mass deportation plans.
The U.S. establishment is sleepwalking toward a crisis. An openly antidemocratic figure stands at least a 50-50 chance of winning the presidency. The Supreme Court and the Republican Party have abdicated their gatekeeping responsibilities, and too many of America's most influential political, business and religious leaders remain on the sidelines. Unable to rise above fear or narrow ambition, they hedge their bets. But time is running out.
What are they waiting for?

Market Meanders as Tesla and IBM Test Highs and Lows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street drifted to a mixed finish Thursday after Tesla surged to one of the best days in its history, while IBM slumped to its worst in six months.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to break its first three-day losing streak since early September. It bounced between losses and gains through the day, and it was roughly evenly split between stocks rising and falling.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8 percent.
Tesla led the market with a jump of 21.9 percent after the electric-vehicle maker reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Elon Musk, the C.E.O., was optimistic in predicting 20 percent to 30 percent sales growth next year, though Tesla's revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts' forecasts. It was the best day for Tesla's stock since 2013.
UPS climbed 5.3 percent after likewise topping analysts' forecasts for profit. The package-delivery company's finances can offer a window into the strength of the economy because of how many different types of customers it serves, and its revenue edged past expectations.
ServiceNow, whose platform helps companies automate and connect processes, was another one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. It rose 5.4 percent after delivering stronger profit and revenue than expected, driven by customer interest in artificial-intelligence technology.
Such gains helped to offset a drop of 6.2 percent for IBM, which reported revenue for the latest quarter that fell just short of analysts' expectations. It was the single biggest reason the Dow dragged behind other indexes.
Boeing was another weight and sank 1.2 percent after its machinists voted to continue their strike, which has crippled aircraft production. More than 60 percent of union members who voted on the proposed contract rejected it, keeping them on the picket lines six weeks into their strike.
Union Pacific dropped 4.4 percent after the railroad reported slightly weaker profit and revenue than expected.
Stocks have broadly regressed this week after the S&P 500 and Dow both set records at the end of last week. Critics had already been saying that stocks looked too expensive, given how much faster their prices have risen than corporate profits.
Yields have climbed as report after report has shown the economy remains stronger than expected. That's good news for Wall Street, because it bolsters hopes the economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without a painful recession.
But it's also forcing traders to ratchet back forecasts for how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.
A report on unemployment claims Thursday offered a mixed picture on the job market. It said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which can be a signal of relatively low layoffs. But it also said the total number of those collecting benefits rose to its highest level in almost three years.
Altogether, the numbers show a slowing economy, "but there is no sign of a crash in employment or a surge of layoffs in these data," according to Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi at High Frequency Economics.
Treasury yields, which had eased overnight, pared their losses after the release of the unemployment claims report before yo-yoing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.20 percent from 4.25 percent late Wednesday.
A separate preliminary report said growth in business activity may have accelerated slightly last month, as strength for companies in services industries continue to make up for weakness in manufacturing. The report from S&P Global also showed a recovery in confidence as companies anticipate greater stability and certainty after the upcoming presidential election.
A third report said sales of new homes were stronger last month than economists expected.

Amazon Could Be Forced to Treat Delivery Drivers as Employees: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Amazon's delivery system depends on third-party companies. But labor regulators have challenged that model, possibly opening the way for unionization.
Vans marked with Amazon's arrow logo have become ubiquitous on residential streets, a symbol of the nearly instantaneous delivery that has transformed online shopping.
But behind the wheel, that image of high-tech efficiency is being overshadowed by drivers' complaints about working conditions. Recent federal labor rulings could pave the way for unionization in the company's last-mile delivery network and change how it does business.
Hundreds of thousands of drivers who deliver Amazon packages don't work directly for the e-commerce giant; instead, they're employed by third-party logistics companies, called delivery service partners. Last year, Amazon ended a contract with a delivery company in Palmdale, Calif., after drivers started organizing with the Teamsters union.
A regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles issued the first formal complaint last week targeting the company's delivery model, arguing in the Palmdale case that Amazon is a joint employer of the drivers and, as such, must bargain with the union.
Last month, another N.L.R.B. regional director issued a preliminary finding that Amazon is a joint employer of drivers in Atlanta seeking to unionize with the Teamsters, and that it must be held liable for unlawfully discouraging unionization.
Eileen Hards, an Amazon spokeswoman, said there was "no merit" to the cases, adding, "We look forward to showing that as the legal process continues."
The process is likely to be long; in the Palmdale case, a hearing before an administrative law judge is scheduled for March, and any decisions are open to appeal. And this year, a federal judge blocked an N.L.R.B. rule that would have broadened the standards for determining when a company is a joint employer.
But if the cases against Amazon prevail, they could eventually prompt a restructuring of the company's last-mile delivery system and open the door to a wave of union organizing, labor experts said.
"When it comes to organizing, success breeds success," said Benjamin Sachs, a labor professor at Harvard Law School.
A Question of Control
At the heart of the labor board cases is a key question: How much control does Amazon exert over those delivering packages?
The e-commerce giant argues that its role is minimal. Over 3,000 delivery service partners, or D.S.P.s, determine pay, schedules and work conditions for drivers, the company said.
But according to N.L.R.B. findings, the Teamsters and many drivers, Amazon dictates nearly every aspect of the job.
Dustin Neskahi has been delivering packages for Amazon in Lenexa, Kan., for almost a year and a half, through Go Go Logistics, a service partner. With roughly 300 packages to deliver each day at more than 200 locations, he said, he sometimes has to forgo the two 15-minute breaks he is allowed.
If he fails to drop off all of the packages in his van by the end of the day, Amazon penalizes Go Go Logistics, he said.
"I just feel like I have the pressure to represent what they want from us," Mr. Neskahi said. "I've got to be Amazon's little poster boy for a delivery driver."
Once last month, Mr. Neskahi said, he drove for more than 10 hours without a break and didn't finish his deliveries until 9:30 p.m.
Cameras in the Amazon-branded van monitor his moves -- information sent directly to Amazon, which alerts Go Go Logistics to any infractions. On that late night on the road, Mr. Neskahi had to look away from the dashboard longer than usual to identify addresses in the dark. That, he said, will probably result in a markdown on his scorecard.
The monitoring and expectations to perform come from Amazon, he said. The subcontracted company is "under a chokehold," he added. "They are the messengers, the middlemen."
Ms. Hards, Amazon's spokeswoman, pushed back against the notion that Amazon penalizes third-party companies for their performance. Amazon sets safety, compliance and quality standards, she said, and provides resources to help meet them. Cameras in vans flag unsafe behavior on the road, she said, but D.S.P.s are responsible for how to respond.
Workers at Go Go Logistics have not taken steps to unionize. But Mr. Neskahi said he and a couple of fellow employees had encouraged others to join them in talking to a Teamsters representative. A union, he said, could take up issues of pay and workload with Amazon directly.
When it ended its contract with the delivery service in Palmdale after drivers started to organize, Amazon said the move was unrelated to the union campaign -- but Johnathon Ervin, who owns the business, Battle-Tested Strategies, argued that it was retaliation. (Ms. Hards of Amazon said the company "does not retaliate for union organization.")
Mr. Ervin said he had been drawn to the Amazon delivery program because of the allure of becoming an entrepreneur. He served as an Amazon ambassador at one point, talking to prospective D.S.P. owners.
"But eventually, you realize over the years that they don't want leaders," Mr. Ervin said. "They do not want pushback. They want compliance."
Mr. Ervin said all the driver metrics available to him as the owner of a subcontracted delivery company came from Amazon, through the e-commerce giant's systems. When Amazon's system found an infraction, an Amazon manager would tell him how to counsel the driver, he said.
The N.L.R.B. regional director's finding that Amazon is a joint employer of the Palmdale drivers "confirmed the obvious," Mr. Ervin said. Amazon was his company's only client, and it hasn't operated since he lost the contract.
Most recently, drivers at eight D.S.P.s in New York City signed authorization cards to unionize with the Teamsters. Drivers at four service partners in Skokie, Ill., have also signed Teamsters union cards this year.
Emmanuel Trinidad has been delivering Amazon packages for just over one year through Cornucopia Logistics in the New York borough of Queens, where hundreds of drivers have signed union cards. On a Monday morning in early October, he tapped his badge at the entrance to Amazon's DBK4 plant, donning an Amazon vest as a steady flow of Prime-branded vans exited the parking lot.
If he gets a few stops behind schedule, Amazon immediately tells Cornucopia to contact him, Mr. Trinidad said.
"To me, that tells you I work for Amazon as well," he said.
Last month, Mr. Trinidad and his colleagues staged a demonstration to demand that Amazon recognize their Teamsters union and negotiate a contract. They got a raise, but Mr. Trinidad said it was not enough. His brother is represented by the Teamsters as a UPS employee in Massachusetts. Mr. Trinidad wants the same, in the hopes of securing better benefits and clear workload guidelines. Some days, he said, he has to deliver 350 packages at over 100 locations.
"We just need a more stable work environment," he said.
A Legal Battle Ahead
The fight in Palmdale offers a peek at the challenges ahead.
For one, under U.S. labor law, the Teamsters have to organize drivers location by location at the thousands of D.S.P.s, said Susan Schurman, a labor professor at Rutgers University. The same situation has posed hurdles for union organizing at companies like Starbucks.
"That's a massive challenge to any union, even one as big as the Teamsters," Ms. Schurman said.
And even after drivers vote to unionize, Amazon could stretch out the bargaining process; workers at a Staten Island Amazon warehouse who voted to unionize more than two years ago still don't have a contract.
Unions have to persuade drivers to get on board, too. While there is momentum for unionization at Amazon facilities like the one in Queens, some drivers, especially those who are new to the job, aren't willing to throw their full support behind the Teamsters' campaign just yet.
Dia Ortiz, two weeks into her job as a driver based at Amazon's center in Queens, said she was earning more than she did as a manager at Old Navy. A $ 1.50-an-hour raise, which took effect around the time the union campaign went public, was enough to keep her from signing a union card, she said.
Despite the hurdles, the N.L.R.B.'s early findings could spur more union organizing. They have the potential to eventually force Amazon to the bargaining table as the "party that has the power to make things better," Mr. Sachs of Harvard Law School said.
Conditions for drivers, as they stand, have pushed Malachi Allen away from the job. Mr. Allen started working for a Sacramento delivery service called ONCI in early 2023, with the allure of $ 23.50 an hour for solo work on the road. But the scrutiny of his moves quickly soured him on the job.
The last straw came on Aug. 19. Mr. Allen, on his 45-minute drive to deliver packages in Fairfield, Calif., took one more bathroom stop than usual: first at a truck stop by the freeway on-ramp, and then at a gas station. Usually, Mr. Allen would have urinated in a bottle to avoid falling behind on his route. But on that day, he didn't have a bottle.
His dispatcher took note of the unplanned stop, sent him a screenshot of his location and demanded an explanation, according to text message exchanges.
Mr. Allen said he would have supported a union to push Amazon to improve conditions. But he never discussed it with his co-workers, fearing that Amazon could stop working with his company.
He decided to quit in late August.
"I got so fed up with Amazon," Mr. Allen said. "It's probably just best, instead of going to another D.S.P., to start something fresh."

Full text: Doctors can provide alternative forms of screening for colon and rectal cancer but sometimes have a good reason to stick with the colonoscope.
This year about 53,000 Americans are expected to die from colon or rectal cancer. Doctors say most people should start getting screened at age 45. Yet many who are eligible skip testing.
When most people in this country think of colon cancer screening, they think of colonoscopies, which let doctors examine the colon but can be inconvenient. Yet there are other equally acceptable options for screening.
If more people knew about other kinds of colorectal cancer testing, some experts hope, perhaps some who put off colonoscopies would be screened and deaths from colon cancer could be avoided.
Here's what you need to know about colonoscopies and fecal tests, which to ask for, and why your doctor might be recommending one over the other.
How do colonoscopies and fecal tests work?
Colonoscopies are widely used, but there is another option available: fecal tests.
Both types of test attempt to find cancers and large polyps -- growths on the wall of the colon -- that occasionally turn into cancers. Cancers that are found early often can be cured when doctors simply cut them out. Finding and removing polyps can also prevent cancers.
Colonoscopies start with a patient's taking strong laxatives to empty the colon. On the day of the test, the patient is sedated. Then, a doctor inserts a colonoscope -- a flexible tube with a video camera at the end -- into the rectum and colon and looks for polyps and cancers to remove. The doctor may also take samples for study in a lab.
If no polyps or cancers are found, the average patient can wait 10 years before having another colonoscopy.
Fecal tests can be done at home. Patients collect a stool sample and mail it to or drop it off at a testing lab.
One option is the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, which should be repeated annually. A lab analyzes the sample for traces of blood, which can indicate a polyp or cancer. Large polyps and colon cancers sporadically ooze small amounts of blood. If blood is detected, the patient must have a colonoscopy.
Another more complex fecal test is Cologuard, repeated every three years. It looks for blood in stool and also for abnormal DNA from large polyps and colon cancers. Like the FIT test, Cologuard must be followed by a colonoscopy if blood or abnormal DNA are present.
Which option actually works better?
That depends on what is meant by "better."
One measure is how often a test finds large polyps.
If a person who has a large polyp has a colonoscopy, the test will detect it 95 percent of the time. If that person has a Cologuard test, there is a 42 percent chance that it will be positive because of the polyp. If the person has a FIT test, there is about a 22 percent chance it will be positive.
Another measure is how likely the test is to find cancers when they are present.
Colonoscopies find 95 percent. A one-time Cologuard test will be positive 94 percent of the time if a cancer is present, and a FIT test will be positive 74 percent of the time.
The ultimate goal, though, is preventing colon cancer deaths. For now, no one really knows which test performs better. One large clinical trial by the Department of Veterans Affairs is comparing the number of colon cancer deaths among 50,000 patients randomly assigned to have a colonoscopy or an annual FIT test and followed for 10 years.
Results are expected in 2027 or 2028.
While those studies are continuing, other studies have compared a screening test with no test.
One study found that after 30 years, people who had fecal tests had a 33 percent lower death rate from colon cancer than people who were not screened. The death rate fell to 2 percent, from 3 percent.
A 10-year European study of colonoscopy found a 30 percent reduction in the risk of getting colon cancer. It was 0.84 percent in a group that had colonoscopies and 1.22 percent in a group that was not screened. There was no difference in the risk of dying from colon cancer.
Whether the reduction in the risk of getting colon cancer is worth a potential risk of injury during the surgery is "in the eye of the beholder," said Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist at the University of Oslo who led the study.
Can I ask my doctor for a fecal test if I prefer it to a colonoscopy?
Of course -- if you are of average risk, meaning no family history of colon cancer and no genetic condition that predisposes to colon cancer. If you are at a higher risk, your doctor is likely to advise a colonoscopy.
When patients of average risk ask Dr. David Lieberman, a gastroenterologist at Oregon Health and Science University, if they can skip the colonoscopy, he explains that a fecal test and a colonoscopy accomplish different things. Fecal tests are likely to find cancers when they are early enough to be cured. But he says those tests are not so good at finding precancerous polyps. While the hope is that, repeated over time, the fecal tests will find polyps, colonoscopies find both with a single test.
Hearing that, he said, most patients decide they want colonoscopies.
What do the tests cost?
Many patients pay little or nothing because insurance, including Medicare, covers the tests. But testing does cost the health care system.
Prices for the testing vary, but one estimate says a colonoscopy for people with private insurance costs the insurer about $ 3,442. A single Cologuard test costs about $ 763, and a single FIT test costs about $ 91.
Why do doctors prefer colonoscopies?
Many doctors think they are saving patients' lives with colonoscopies.
"The idea of finding and removing cancer precursor lesions became very attractive to physicians," Dr. Lieberman said.
But there is also a financial incentive for the procedure.
"Colonoscopy is a massive revenue generator for hospital systems," said Dr. Adewole Adamson, of the University of Texas in Austin, who studies cancer screening.
Doctors profit too, said Dr. Samir Gupta, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Diego. "When we do the procedure, that's part of our income," he said. "We are all conflicted."
Many other countries with modern national health systems use FIT tests because they are cheap, and because they lack the capacity for wider use of colonoscopies.
But there are places in the U.S. that don't emphasize colonoscopies. Most V.A. centers mail FIT tests to eligible patients every year.
So does Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation's largest medical care providers. In the company's lab in Northern California, for instance, testing is done "on an industrial scale," Dr. Theodore Levin, a Kaiser gastroenterologist, said, with 15,000 to 20,000 FIT tests processed each week.
In describing some of Kaiser's motivation for offering FIT, Dr. Levin added, "All the physicians are salaried, so they are not doing screening to support their practice."
Dr. Amitpal S. Johal, director of gastroenterology at Geisinger, a large health care system in Pennsylvania, says Cologuard is preferred because of its greater accuracy and because it only needs to be done every three years. The test is useful for the system's large rural population for whom a center that does colonoscopies can be far away.
"Some of these people can't drive five hours" for the test, he said, while "Cologuard will mail the test to them, and UPS will pick it up."
When can I get a blood test instead of these options?
The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a blood test called Shield by the company Guardant Health. The test looks for fragments of DNA shed from colon cancers and polyps. If it finds evidence of cancer or large polyps, you need a colonoscopy.
The problem is that the test is not very accurate and does especially poorly at finding large polyps. Still, gastroenterologists say it is better than nothing.
The blood test also is expensive at $ 1,495. Medicare will pay for it every three years, Guardant said.

Storm Shows Need for Emergency Plans Inland: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Most of the deaths from Hurricane Helene occurred far from Florida, where the storm first made landfall. Experts say alerts and evacuation orders need to target inland residents too.
When the warnings first arrived, days before the remnants of Hurricane Helene, Kimberly Moody took note of what was said -- and what wasn't. The storm was going to be bad, that much was clear. But no one said she needed to start packing.
In the wake of the devastation that leveled swaths of her town of Black Mountain, N.C., and that killed a friend when he was swept into the Swannanoa River, Ms. Moody is hesitant to point fingers. But she can't help but wonder if evacuation orders might have helped save lives.
"The alert said, Stay in the house. Stay away from the window. But no one said to leave," Ms. Moody, a 53-year-old UPS worker, said. "Next time they should ask us to leave. This storm was notorious. It was mean. It was raging."
Across the inland region where Helene leveled towns and turned deadly, residents and public officials faced a reckoning this week. Most people said they could not have imagined such severe impacts from a storm that made landfall hundreds of miles away on the Florida coast, and few saw widespread evacuations as likely or risk-free fixes for future extreme weather emergencies.
But the post-Helene re-assessments in western North Carolina and elsewhere reflect a growing recognition nationally that storm emergency planning needs to broaden its outreach. Long focused on the coasts where such storms make landfall, there are now calls to give equal attention to the risks in the places they end up.
Helene killed more than 200 people in six states. The first fatalities occurred in Florida, where at least a dozen people died, but many more were killed in inland areas where high winds and flash flooding wiped out homes, businesses, roads and bridges.
The heavy toll of hurricanes far away from the coastline is not new or surprising -- or even that infrequent, as a warming climate supercharges storms with heavier rainfall. From 2013 to 2022, more than half of deaths attributed to tropical cyclones were caused by inland flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center.
What hasn't caught up is the way that inland residents often view the risks of hurricanes and their aftermath. Many still tend to underreact to warnings, imagining themselves at a safe distance from hurricanes' worst dangers.
"Inland deaths are growing because there's too much focus on the coast," said Craig Fugate, former administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "People have to stop focusing just on landfall and understand that a tropical depression, after the hurricane is downgraded, is just as deadly."
In North Carolina, emergency managers for both the state and individual counties sent repeated alerts to cellphones in at-risk areas before Helene struck, pinging all phones within range of designated cell towers. But mountainous terrain can block alerts from getting through, as can damage to the towers, and some older phones may not receive the alerts.
Some counties took additional measures. In Haywood County, N.C., west of Asheville, Allison Richmond, an emergency services spokeswoman, said that new protocols developed after a powerful blow from Tropical Storm Fred three years ago led to more intensive preparation this time.
Such procedures included in-person outreach to remote areas where emergency personnel monitored newly installed river gauges and used truck-mounted loudspeakers and Spanish-speaking deputies to spread warnings into far-flung corners.
"Because of the previous storm, people were more keyed in to the risk, and a lot of people did evacuate ahead of time," she said.
One potentially lifesaving innovation wasn't ready before Helene swept in: new siren systems, which the county purchased after the last storm but had not yet installed, to warn residents of imminent flooding. The long-term goal, Ms. Richmond said, is to link the river gauges and the sirens to create a seamless safety net. First, though, the brand-new gauges lost to Helene will have to be replaced.
In Canton, a town of 4,400, local officials sent alerts to residents to warn them to take the storm seriously. Local television news was full of dire warnings. But not everyone felt the urgency, and the town did not call for widespread evacuations. Few residents interviewed there and in other hard-hit communities said they had seriously considered leaving.
Some said they wanted to stay and help. Many, looking at the alternatives, decided that they were more at risk trying to escape the storm on narrow, winding mountain roads or on rain-swept highways than hunkered down at home. Others said they could not afford to travel and pay for lodging elsewhere.
"Most people don't really think about evacuating," said Davit Scott, 70, of Black Mountain, 15 miles east of Asheville. "We have jobs. We have to make a living."
Margaret Marshall, a 57-year-old supermarket cashier whose home in Candler, 11 miles southwest of Asheville, was spared, scoffed at the idea that she and her husband could have fled to another city like Charlotte, two hours away, to escape Helene. "We've got nowhere else to go," she said.
Some places, such as Buncombe County, home to Asheville, did order evacuations, with gentler "self-evacuation" recommendations last Thursday giving way to mandatory orders last Friday morning, as the most intense part of the storm struck the area.
Mr. Fugate said he expected more discussion about the use of mandatory evacuation orders in inland areas in the wake of Helene, and about the clear communication of inland storm risks to the public.
Last Wednesday, the day before the storm hit Florida, forecasters at NOAA warned of "catastrophic, life-threatening inland flooding" that could occur "even well after landfall." The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., made its own attempt to seize inland residents' attention, posting a warning of the potential for "an extremely rare event with catastrophic flash flooding likely."
"A perfect forecast isn't always going to change the outcome if people don't understand what it means," said Mr. Fugate, who stressed the need for local emergency managers to effectively explain the risk to residents.
Some local officials acknowledged that stronger orders might have been warranted. David "Scottie" Harris, fire chief and interim manager in Weaverville, a town of fewer than 5,000 people about 10 miles north of Asheville, stressed that no one could have predicted the impact. But in hindsight, he said, it may have been appropriate to tell residents in flood-prone areas that leaving was "highly encouraged."
Flood forecasting for mountain regions can be tricky because of complex terrain. And better models are needed to harness data and pinpoint predictions with a finer degree of accuracy, said Vidya Samadi, an assistant professor of water resources engineering at Clemson University who has worked on designing flood evacuation routes.
In towns like Canton, local officials said they would continue to develop better systems for storm planning -- with a newfound understanding of the risks.
"The world has changed," Zeb Smathers, Canton's mayor, said. "Western North Carolina, hundreds and hundreds of miles from the coast, is now in Hurricane Alley."
When Bill and Roi McGuire moved from New Orleans to Black Mountain more than 20 years ago, they relished their newfound sense of safety, far from the hurricane warnings they'd grown used to.
On Tuesday, the McGuires watched as fellow residents collected water from a public swimming pool to use for bathing and filling their toilets, and marveled that Hurricane Helene had reached so far.
"That is one of the reasons we left New Orleans -- to get away from the storms -- and we got them here," Mr. McGuire said. "You can't escape storms now, wherever you go."
Many Asheville area residents said without hesitation that they had been surprised or shocked by the severity of Helene. Several acknowledged that the frequency of weather warnings could breed complacency.
Ashley Wells, of Canton, followed the storm on the Weather Channel and listened to the advisories on her cellphone but heard nothing that struck her as substantially different from the warnings of the past.
"We talk about it now -- we should have left," she said. "It has never been this bad."
Lisa Bryson, 47, of West Asheville, thinks local officials and media "put out plenty of warnings" about Helene. She just wishes she had paid more heed.
"I think from here on out if they say it's going to be bad," she said, "we'll be prepared."

When the warnings first arrived, days before the remnants of Hurricane Helene, Kimberly Moody took note of what was said — and what wasn’t. The storm was going to be bad, that much was clear. But no one said she needed to start packing.

China's Products Face New Tariffs In Push By Biden: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The administration moved to block off a popular tariff-free path for Chinese apparel coming into the United States, and added stiff levies on electric vehicles, solar panels and other products.
The Biden administration on Friday announced measures that will add tariffs to Chinese products worth tens of billions of dollars, a move intended to both protect American factories and project a tough-on-China approach ahead of the presidential election.
The tariffs, which range from 7.5 percent to 100 percent, will apply to clothing, solar panels, electric vehicles, syringes, steel and other goods that China has been selling at far cheaper prices than many American businesses, threatening to put U.S. factories out of business.
The steps are likely to raise the cost of some imports at a time when Americans are already dissatisfied with rising prices. But they also represent a major effort by the Biden administration to address a salient political issue for some voters: America's dependence on China for an array of products.
Both Democrats and Republicans have turned away from emphasizing the benefits of freer trade to criticizing the role that Chinese imports have played in hollowing out American manufacturing and damaging communities centered around those factories. This week, Vice President Kamala Harris sparred with former President Donald J. Trump over the impact of tariffs, and Republican lawmakers proposed several new laws aimed at reducing China's economic influence.
One of the measures the Biden administration proposed would drastically limit a trade rule, called de minimis, that allowed more than one billion packages from China to enter the United States last year without being subject to existing tariffs. The administration said a flood of shipments under the rule had hurt American manufacturers and allowed products like fentanyl and counterfeit goods to come into the country.
The trade rule allows packages to be shipped from foreign countries directly to consumers or businesses without paying tariffs, as long as the shipments do not exceed $ 800 per recipient per day. The new proposal would strip that exemption from a wide array of products and is likely to have a significant impact on large exporters of Chinese goods such as Shein and Temu, two online marketplaces that have become popular with American shoppers.
"The drastic increase in de minimis shipments has made it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S.," said Daleep Singh, the deputy White House national security adviser for international economics.
"We're making sure foreign companies respect our laws and don't endanger American families," Mr. Singh added.
The Biden administration on Friday also published a long-awaited review of the tariffs that the Trump administration placed on more than $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods beginning in 2018.
The report, which runs to 187 pages, concluded that the Trump tariffs had been effective in reducing U.S. exposure to harmful trade practices from China, and that they should be maintained. It found that those tariffs had encouraged China to take steps toward eliminating some of its harmful policies, though the report said such programs continue to exist.
The report also said that the tariffs contributed to U.S. companies shifting their sourcing out of and away from China. China's overall share of U.S. imports fell to 13.7 percent in 2023 from 21.6 percent in 2017.
As part of the review, the Biden administration said it was adding or increasing tariffs on additional products from China, including electric vehicles, battery parts, medical gloves, graphite, semiconductors and other goods. Those levies will go into effect on Sept. 27. The Biden administration put forward some of these additional tariffs in May, but this week's report finalized those measures, as well as proposed additional levies on tungsten and solar products.
Katherine Tai, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the tariffs would "target the harmful policies and practices of the People's Republic of China that continue to impact American workers and businesses."
Liu Pengyu, the spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that the tariffs were "the product of unilateralism and protectionism."
"China firmly opposes this and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its own rights and interests," he said.
The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for technology firms, said the additional tariffs on chips and other electronics would "cause more disruption and instability in global supply chains."
The Biden administration "has repeatedly dismissed industry concerns regarding economic impacts and supply chain resilience in favor of more tariffs," it said.
The decision to formalize Mr. Trump's tariffs and add new ones could put Ms. Harris in an tricky position given her criticism of the former president's approach to China. Mr. Trump has said that, if elected, he would seek to impose even higher tariffs on China -- as much as 60 percent -- as well as a 10 percent to 20 percent tariff on imports from other countries. Ms. Harris has blasted that idea as a "national sales tax."
At this week's debate, Mr. Trump noted that the Biden administration had adopted similar trade policies, saying: "She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat."
Democrats have tried to strike a careful balance in distinguishing their trade policy from that of Republicans, while also trying to appeal to voters who appreciate Mr. Trump's more aggressive trade approach.
The Biden administration's review of Mr. Trump's China tariffs, which took more than two years, spurred a debate among Biden officials. Some argued for reducing certain tariffs on goods as a way to ease prices on American consumers. But they were overruled by others who said the United States could not countenance decreasing trade penalties on China.
The Biden administration's additional tariffs on electric vehicles and other products will cover $ 18 billion of Chinese imports. It is not clear exactly how much trade will be covered by the proposal to close the de minimis loophole, but the change appears to apply to a substantial portion of U.S. de minimis imports, which totaled $ 54.5 billion last year.
That measure, to be finalized after a public comment period, would eliminate de minimis treatment for any product subject to tariffs under several legal provisions, including those that the Trump and Biden administrations have used to levy tariffs on global metals, foreign solar panels and a vast array of products from China. Those tariff programs cover at least 40 percent of overall U.S. imports, as well as 70 percent of Chinese textile and apparel imports, the administration said.
The de minimis provision stems from a century-old trade law and was originally intended for shipments that would be too trivial to require scrutiny from U.S. customs officials.
But in recent years, online companies like Shein -- and some sellers of Chinese goods on Amazon -- have used the provision to gain market share in the United States, shipping cheap clothing and other items directly from Chinese factories to consumers' doorsteps. In addition to bypassing tariffs, the companies can eliminate costs for warehousing in the United States.
The number of packages entering the United States each year under the de minimis rule reached more than one billion in 2023, compared with 140 million a decade ago, according to federal statistics. Importers do not have to provide as much information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection as with other packages, creating concerns that it has become a conduit for drugs and unsafe products.
China is by far the biggest source for such packages, sending more than all other countries combined, according to the customs agency.
House Republicans had discussed taking up legislation to limit de minimis shipments in a package of bills targeting China this week, but they ultimately could not agree on a measure. In recent years, lawmakers of both parties in the House and the Senate have proposed legislation to clamp down on de minimis shipments.
In a letter to the Biden administration on Wednesday, more than 100 Democratic lawmakers urged it to use "the full range" of its authorities to limit de minimis shipments.
On Friday, Representative Jason Smith, Republican of Missouri and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, claimed credit for the policy. He said that the Biden rule mirrored a law proposed by a Republican congressman and passed by the committee this year.
"They say imitation is the highest form of flattery," he said, "so I am pleased Democrats in Washington are once again acknowledging that Republicans' tough-on-China trade policy works."
The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group that includes Home Depot, Target, Dollar General and others, praised the move, saying it would protect "American consumers and disadvantaged American companies," as well as help authorities keep noncompliant or dangerous goods from entering the United States.
Both Shein and Temu have said that while they use de minimis, it is not core to their success. A Temu spokeswoman said the company was open to changes that helped consumers.
Donald Tang, the executive chairman of Shein, said in an interview on Thursday that he would be "very happy to embrace" the end of de minimis. As long as it is there, "then we're going to use the channel," he said. But if it is eliminated, "then we're going to find different ways to satisfy our customers."
Both Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration have suggested that Congress will need to take further action to shut down the de minimis exemption more fully.
Groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and shippers like FedEx and UPS have opposed the changes to de minimis proposed by lawmakers. The National Foreign Trade Council, which lobbies on behalf of major importers, has argued that getting rid of de minimis would create more work for Customs and Border Protection and not do much to stop illegal substances from entering the United States.
"The only outcome here is that it's a tax increase," said John Pickel, the organization's senior director of international supply chain policy.
An economic study released in June found that eliminating de minimis entirely would result in costs of $ 12 billion to $ 14 billion for American consumers. (The Biden administration's move will only narrow the exemption, not eliminate it.)
An author of that study, Amit Khandelwal, an economist at Yale University, said the costs of repealing de minimis would fall disproportionately on lower-income people, who his research showed were purchasing more from China than wealthier groups.
"Domestic retailers, domestic producers, they obviously would benefit from taxing these imports," he said. "But there is a cost, and the cost is often harder to see."

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Friday announced measures that will add tariffs to Chinese products worth tens of billions of dollars, a move intended to protect U.S. factories and project a tough-on-China approach before the presidential election.
The tariffs, which range from 7.5% to 100%, will apply to clothing, solar panels, electric vehicles, syringes, steel and other goods that China has been selling at far cheaper prices than many U.S. businesses, threatening to put U.S. factories out of business.
The steps are likely to raise the cost of some imports at a time when Americans are already dissatisfied with rising prices. But they also represent a major effort by the Biden administration to address a salient political issue for some voters: America’s dependence on China for an array of products.
Both Democrats and Republicans have turned away from emphasizing the benefits of freer trade to criticizing the role that Chinese imports have played in hollowing out U.S. manufacturing and damaging the communities centered around those factories. This week, Vice President Kamala Harris sparred with former President Donald Trump over the impact of tariffs, and Republican lawmakers proposed several new laws aimed at reducing China’s economic influence.
One of the measures the Biden administration proposed would drastically limit a trade rule, called de minimis, that allowed more than 1 billion packages from China to enter the United States last year without being subject to existing tariffs. The administration said a flood of shipments under the rule had hurt U.S. manufacturers and allowed products like fentanyl and counterfeit goods to come into the country.
The trade rule allows packages to be shipped from foreign countries directly to consumers or businesses without paying tariffs, as long as the shipments do not exceed $800 per recipient per day. The new proposal would strip that exemption from a wide array of products and is likely to have a significant impact on large exporters of Chinese goods such as Shein and Temu, two online marketplaces that have become popular with American shoppers.
“The drastic increase in de minimis shipments has made it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S.,” said Daleep Singh, the deputy White House national security adviser for international economics.
“We’re making sure foreign companies respect our laws and don’t endanger American families,” Singh added.

Pro Athletes Drawn to Anime: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Young professional athletes are increasingly broadcasting their obsession with anime like "Pokémon" and "Naruto," upending preconceptions about kinds of fandom.
Instead of talking about football after he joined the New Orleans Saints, Jamaal Williams introduced himself to reporters last year with a dialogue on "Pokémon," prompted by the foxlike character Eevee perched on his head.
In homage to "Avatar: The Last Airbender," the mixed-martial artist Israel Adesanya has boldly nicknamed himself the Last Stylebender.
And the sprinter Noah Lyles, to celebrate his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter dash this summer, cupped his hands forward as if generating the "Kamehameha," an energy-blast attack from "Dragon Ball Z."
High-profile athletes are increasingly broadcasting their fascination with anime, creating a fraternity inside locker rooms as they lovingly dissect favorite animated Japanese shows and films. In the process, they are upending preconceptions about different kinds of fandom and outdated labels that seek to define and divide jocks and geeks.
"There's more nerds out here that can ball out and like anime," said Williams, 29, who has worn an anime helmet visor and gently corrected a reporter who mispronounced "Pokèmon." "You don't have to be the stereotype where all we do is rap or play ball."
Anime often derives from the Japanese graphic novels known as manga, and its popularity in the United States ballooned in the late 1990s with shows like "Dragon Ball Z," "Pokémon" and "One Piece."
Although outsiders often consider the art form a niche interest, it is a touchstone for younger generations, including athletes who have earned their fame by breaking tackles or slugging home runs.
"Every time you find somebody that likes it, your eyes just light up," said Julio Rodriguez, 23, who leads the Seattle Mariners in hits this season and said watching anime was therapeutic when rehabilitating injuries.
The N.B.A. star Joel Embiid, 30, has been seen watching "Dragon Ball GT" while getting treatment on the massage table before a playoff game. After Coco Gauff, 20, won her U.S. Open semifinal last year, she acknowledged watching four or five episodes of "My Hero Academia" beforehand; this summer, a UPS advertisement turned her into an anime character.
Myles Garrett, a defensive end and one of the most physically intimidating players in the N.F.L., brings manga with him to the Cleveland Browns facility each day in hopes of sneaking in a chapter.
"It took years for it to happen, but it was a young generation that was open to exploring new things," said Garrett, 28, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award last season. "They got us while we were young and impressionable and stayed up way too late, and we just continued to be more exposed."
Garrett is now watching "Jujutsu Kaisen" and "Trigun," and estimated that about 60 percent of N.F.L. players were casual anime fans; Zion Williamson, 24, told GQ a few years ago that the N.B.A. number was even greater.
Williams said he related to the adversity that anime characters overcome whenever he was battered during football games. While growing up, he was inspired by Naruto, a lonely reject who became a superpowered ninja.
"It's not that drastic as it is in anime where they be in life-or-death-type situations, but when I'm on the field, it feels like that because it's that important to me," Williams said.
Williams said he waited until his second N.F.L. season to showcase his anime frenzy. He first wanted to establish himself to teammates and coaches. "It can catch people off-guard sometimes," he said. "I just tried to be more business up front."
When Kobie Turner, a 25-year-old defensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams, saw Williams refer to Naruto during a nationally televised game, it helped reassure him it was safe to vocalize his interests.
"To see guys fully show who you are has been extremely encouraging," Turner said.
As athletes have publicized their love of anime, some teams have joined in. Last month the Mariners gave fans a Naruto-themed headband in honor of Rodriguez. In a TikTok video last year, the Browns portrayed Garrett as a "Super Saiyan," a physical transformation from "Dragon Ball Z" where characters become stronger.
The Rams teamed up with the video game company Bandai Namco to distribute "One Piece"-themed bags and towels, and also displayed animations from the series on the stadium video board.
Jennifer Prince, the chief commercial officer for the Rams, said that she noticed how athletes connected with anime when she was an executive at Twitter and that she believed collaborations could help the team recruit fans in Japan and South Korea.
"It captures creativity and sound and color and motion in a really different way than possibly we're used to seeing, and I think that our fans were really drawn to it," she said.
The anime industry is also trying to capitalize on the interest from athletes. Crunchyroll, a streaming service dedicated to anime, enlisted the N.F.L. player Aidan Hutchinson to serve as an awards show presenter and teamed with the N.B.A. on clothing.
Rahul Purini, the president of Crunchyroll, said athletes with large followings were great ambassadors for the genre as it continued to push into the mainstream.
"All of those old myths and concerns about, 'What will people think if I tell them that I watch anime?' go away because if this person that is a celebrity and really famous athlete is talking about it, then it's OK for every one of us to talk about it," Purini said. "It's a very important thing for the medium."
While Turner was a rookie with the Rams last year, he watched anime on team flights and proudly wore "Jujutsu Kaisen" shirts. Although it is rare for defensive linemen to reach the end zone, he is still planning additional ways to celebrate his off-field interests.
"The ones that know it, they'll pick up on it and it'll be super-cool," said Turner, who plans to act out Naruto's "shadow clone jutsu" if he ever scores a touchdown. After he makes a cross signal with his fingers, two teammates will pop out behind him, mimicking the character's mystical ability to spawn doppelgängers.

Parents of Teen Driver in Crash Are Sentenced: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The boy, then 16, survived and has been charged in the death of his 14-year-old passenger. His parents were sentenced to probation and ordered to take parenting classes.
A New York couple who bought their 16-year-old son a BMW were sentenced on Monday to three years of probation and 26 weeks of parenting classes after the teenager drove the car at speeds of more than 100 miles an hour, slammed into a truck and killed his passenger, a 14-year-old girl.
The teenager, whose name has not been released because of his age, was arraigned last December on at least a dozen charges, including second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment of a child. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
He had a junior driver's license, which prohibited him from driving unsupervised under any circumstances in New York City, when in May 2023 he crashed his red 2005 BMW 325i into the back of a parked UPS truck in the Springfield Gardens neighborhood of Queens, prosecutors said.
The teenage driver survived the crash with minor injuries, but his passenger, Fortune Williams, a freshman at a Springfield Gardens high school, was thrown from the car and pronounced dead at the scene, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors decided to charge the teenager's father, Sean Smith, 40, and mother, Deo Ramnarine, 43, with endangering the welfare of a child when they learned that the parents had given him the car and allowed him to drive it to school, even after school administrators had warned them that he was too young to drive legally.
The parents were charged with endangering the welfare of their own son, in a case that prosecutors described as "groundbreaking" and "the first of its kind in New York."
"With this conviction, we have shown that the culpability in a fatal crash can go beyond the driver," Melinda Katz, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement. "Parents who provide vehicles to their children and let them drive illegally can be held responsible in the case of tragedies such as this one."
Mr. Smith, who pleaded guilty in June, apologized during his sentencing hearing in Queens criminal court on Monday.
In court was Fortune's mother, Keisha Francis, who said she believed Mr. Smith's remorse was sincere.
"I accept his apology," she said. But Ms. Francis said she would have preferred that both parents spend a year in jail, the maximum penalty for the charge.
"Their recklessness, it cost my daughter's life," Ms. Francis said. "They need to be held accountable."
Fortune, one of three siblings, had plans to become a doctor and was taking nursing courses in school to prepare for a career in medicine, she said.
Ms. Francis said she visits her daughter's grave every week and often leaves her red roses, her favorite flower. She still pays Fortune's cellphone bills so that she can keep listening to her daughter's voice on her voice mail greeting.
"I don't think there is healing in this," Ms. Francis said. "You just learn to cope."
Mr. Smith pleaded guilty because "he wanted to accept responsibility and move forward for his family and focus on his son's legal defense," said his lawyer, James Polk of the Long Island firm Mazzei and Polk. A lawyer for Ms. Ramnarine, who pleaded guilty last month to the endangerment charge and disorderly conduct, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Polk said he believed the decision to prosecute Mr. Smith was "far-reaching" and set a "potentially dangerous legal precedent."
"They're attempting to charge someone for an act that he wasn't present for and that he had no knowledge was occurring," Mr. Polk said. "It opens the world up to charging people for all sorts of crimes they had no foreseeable way of knowing."
Julie Rendelman, a defense lawyer and a former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, said the case was highly unusual in New York.
"I've never seen it," she said. But Ms. Rendelman said it was reflective of a trend among prosecutors nationwide who feel more emboldened to bring charges against parents whose children commit crimes.
In April, Jennifer and James Crumbley, the parents of Ethan Crumbley, who killed four teenagers in a shooting at his high school in Oxford, Mich., were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison after they were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors had accused them of giving their son access to a gun and ignoring signs that he might do something violent. Ethan Crumbley was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
While "there is certainly a danger in taking this too far -- holding parents criminally responsible for anything their child does," Ms. Rendelman said, the evidence against the parents in the Queens case appeared strong enough to pursue a prosecution.
Mr. Smith told the police he had bought the car for his son, though he had it registered in his own name, prosecutors said.
On May 17, 2023, Mr. Smith's son picked up Fortune at her home in Queens, Ms. Francis said.
Ms. Francis, who is a nurse, was working, but her son, then 12, was home at the time. Fortune walked to the car with her arm around her brother, hugged him and told him she would only be gone about 10 minutes, Ms. Francis said.
She got in the car with the teenager, who later told the police they were headed to his grandmother's house.
Around 6:38 p.m., he was heading west on North Conduit Avenue near 160th Street at 101 miles per hour, prosecutors said. The speed limit was 30 miles per hour.
As he tried to change lanes, prosecutors said, he lost control of the car and hit the truck.
The BMW then spun across the road and struck a tractor-trailer. By then, Fortune had already been flung from the front passenger seat into the back of the UPS truck. The driver of that truck, who was just getting into his truck when the BMW hit it, was thrown to the ground. He was treated for injuries to his leg, chest and face, according to prosecutors.
Mr. Smith told the car's insurer after the crash that his son had driven the BMW twice with him in the vehicle and that the teenager was a good driver, prosecutors said.
But prosecutors said that school administrators had seen the boy driving to school and had told his parents that they were concerned. He was also given a ticket in November 2022 for driving without a license and while using a portable electronic device, prosecutors said.
Ms. Francis said she recalled seeing the teenager in court during a recent hearing and screaming at him, "You're the one who killed my daughter."
The teenager, Ms. Francis said, was quiet and hung his head.
Photograph Fortune Williams, a high school freshman, died last May. She was in a car with a boy whose parents let him drive underage. This article appeared in print on page A20.

Major Indexes Edge Lower as Key Earnings Roll In: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks held relatively steady in a calm Tuesday on Wall Street, as earnings reporting season ramped up for big companies.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average edged down by 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1 percent.
But the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 continued their big run and rose 1 percent. They have flipped the market's leaderboard recently, zooming higher amid hopes for coming cuts to interest rates.
The mixed trading came as dozens of companies reported their results for the spring, with the headliners of Alphabet and Tesla coming after trading closed for the day. Expectations are high, and analysts are forecasting the strongest profit growth for S&P 500 companies broadly since late 2021, according to FactSet.
UPS was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 and tumbled 12.1 percent after delivering weaker profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected.
But Carol Tomé, the UPS chief executive, said the company's U.S. business delivered more packages than a year earlier, its first such growth in nine quarters, and called it a "significant turning point for our company."
Nvidia was the stock weighing the most on the S&P 500. Its loss of 0.8 percent for the day was relatively modest, but the S&P 500 gives more weight to bigger stocks, and Nvidia is worth more than $ 3 trillion.
Comcast dropped 2.6 percent after reporting revenue for the spring that fell short of expectations. Its biggest declines came from lower attendance at its U.S. theme parks and from its studios business, which didn't have as big hits as last year's "The Super Mario Bros." and "Fast X" movies.
Helping to offset those losses was GE Aerospace, which gained 5.7 percent after beating analysts' forecasts for profit in the spring and raising its forecast for earnings over the full year.
Zions Bancorp. jumped 6.2 percent after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected. It and stocks of other regional banks continue to recover from the industry's mini-crisis that began in March 2023, triggered by the punishing effects of high interest rates.
Sherwin-Williams is another company that has felt the pain of high interest rates meant to get inflation under control. It climbed 6.9 percent after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It said it was seeing growth in demand for paint from new residential customers, and it expected the momentum to continue through the year.
That was despite high mortgage rates having chilled the housing industry. A report on Tuesday showed sales of previously occupied homes weakened by even more in June than economists expected. Sales slowed in part because prices for previously occupied homes are at the highest ever recorded, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Easier times may be ahead for rates. With inflation slowing, the wide expectation on Wall Street is for the Federal Reserve to begin lowering its main interest rate in September. That would offer some relief for both the economy and financial markets after the Fed has held the federal funds rate at the highest level in more than two decades.
Treasury yields have sunk since the spring on such expectations, and they remain below their heights reached in April. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was a smidgen lower, at 4.25 percent, barely below where it was in late Monday trading.
Hopes for coming cuts to rates have particularly helped smaller stocks recently. They can get bigger benefits from lower rates than their bigger rivals.
It was a sharp turnaround for smaller stocks, which lagged badly behind their bigger rivals for a while. Analysts see it as an encouraging signal when more stocks participate in a rising market, rather than just a few dominant elites.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Airlines grounded flights. Operators of 911 lines could not respond to emergencies. Hospitals canceled surgeries. Retailers closed for the day. And the actions all traced back to a batch of bad computer code.
A flawed software update sent out by a little-known cybersecurity company caused chaos and disruption around the world Friday. The company, CrowdStrike, based in Austin, Texas, makes software used by multinational corporations, government agencies and scores of other organizations to protect against hackers and online intruders.
But when CrowdStrike sent its update Thursday to its customers that run Microsoft Windows software, computers began to crash.
The fallout, which was immediate and inescapable, highlighted the brittleness of global technology infrastructure. The world has become reliant on Microsoft and a handful of cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike. So when a single flawed piece of software is released over the internet, it can almost instantly damage countless companies and organizations that depend on the technology as part of everyday business.
“This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world’s core internet infrastructure,” said Ciaran Martin, the former CEO of Britain’s National Cyber Security Center and a professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University.
A cyberattack did not cause the widespread outage, but the effects Friday showed how devastating the damage can be when a main artery of the global technology system is disrupted. It raised broader questions about CrowdStrike’s testing processes and what repercussions such software firms should face when flaws in their code cause major disruptions.
While outages are common, often caused by technical errors or cyberattacks, the scale of what unfolded Friday was unparalleled.
“This is historic,” said Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer at WithSecure, a cybersecurity company. “We haven’t had an incident like this.”
George Kurtz, CrowdStrike’s CEO, said that the company took responsibility for the mistake and that a software fix had been released. He warned that it could be some time before tech systems returned to normal.
“We’re deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this,” he said in an interview Friday on NBC’s “Today” show.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, blamed CrowdStrike and said the company was working to help customers “bring their systems back online.” Apple and Linux machines were not affected by the CrowdStrike software update.
A White House official said the administration was in “regular contact” with CrowdStrike and had convened agencies to assess the impact of the outage on the federal government’s operations.
CrowdStrike, founded in 2011 by Kurtz and others, has built a reputation over the years as a firm that could solve even the toughest security problems. It was tapped to investigate a 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee, which exposed Hillary Clinton’s emails.
But problems stemming from CrowdStrike’s products have surfaced before. In April, the company pushed a software update to customers running the Linux system that crashed computers, according to an internal CrowdStrike report sent to customers about the incident, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The bug, which did not appear to be related to Friday’s outage, took CrowdStrike nearly five days to fix, the report said. CrowdStrike promised to improve its testing process going forward, according to the report.
On Thursday, the tech issues began when Microsoft dealt with an outage on its cloud service system, Azure, which affected some airlines.
Then CrowdStrike sent an update for its software called Falcon Sensor, which scans a computer for intrusions and signs of hacking. If everything had gone according to plan, CrowdStrike’s software would have received minor improvements and customers would have hardly noticed.
Instead, when CrowdStrike’s faulty update reached computers running Microsoft Windows, it caused the machines to shut down and then endlessly reboot. Workers around the world were greeted with what is known as the “blue screen of death” on their computers. Insufficient testing at CrowdStrike was a likely source of the problem, experts said.
As computers restarted themselves over and over, known as the “doom loop,” there was little CrowdStrike could do to fix the problem. Tech staff at affected companies were faced with a choice: walk around to each machine and remove the bit of flawed code, or wait and hope for a solution from CrowdStrike.
The problems cascaded instantly. At Sydney Airport in Australia, travelers encountered delays and cancellations, as did those in Hong Kong, India, the United Arab Emirates, Berlin and Amsterdam. At least five U.S. airlines — Allegiant Air, American, Delta, Spirit and United — grounded all flights for a time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Health care systems were crippled, forcing hospitals to cancel noncritical surgeries. In the United States, 911 lines went down in multiple states, though many of those problems were being resolved later Friday. Britain’s National Health Service also reported issues.
“We knew we had a catastrophe on our hands,” said B.J. Moore, the chief information officer for Providence Health, which has 52 hospitals in seven states. He said 15,000 servers were down and 40,000 of Providence’s 150,000 computers were affected, adding that it was “worse than a cyberattack.”
UPS and FedEx said they were affected. Customers with TD Bank, one of the biggest banks in the United States, reported issues accessing their online accounts. Several state and municipal court systems closed for the day because of the outage.
At CrowdStrike, engineers described an atmosphere of confusion as the company struggled to contain the damage.
Executives urged employees not to speculate on why the mistake happened and directed them to focus on a fix for the computers that were affected, said two engineers who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Computers not connected to the cloud required a physical fix to the error introduced by CrowdStrike, they said, which could take weeks.
Within several hours of the faulty software going out, CrowdStrike sent out a software patch as a fix that would stop computers from endlessly rebooting.
Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, said the outage would still take time to resolve because a suggested solution for some organizations involved rebooting each computer manually into safe mode, deleting a specific file and then restarting the computer.
While that is a relatively straightforward process, security experts said, it may not be easy to do at scale. Those with organized and well-staffed information technology teams could potentially fix the issues more quickly, Olejnik said.
Unlike the iPhone software updates that Apple sends to customers, the incident highlighted information technology systems that operate in the background. The CrowdStrike issues were compounded because the software being updated performed critical cybersecurity tasks, giving it access to scan a computer to look for viruses and other malicious attacks.
Cybersecurity tools operate quietly in the background to defend computers against attacks. The software is frequently updated with new defenses as hackers develop fresh methods of attack, but constant updates mean there are many opportunities for mistakes to happen.
“One of the tricky parts of security software is it needs to have absolute privileges over your entire computer in order to do its job,” said Thomas Parenty, a cybersecurity consultant and a former U.S. National Security Agency analyst. “So if there’s something wrong with it, the consequences are vastly greater than if your spreadsheet doesn’t work.”
On Friday, the stock price of CrowdStrike, which reported $3 billion in annual revenue last year, closed down 11%.
The company faces questions about what liabilities it and other software makers face for major disruptions and cybersecurity incidents. The consequences for significant outages can be so minimal that companies are not motivated to make more fundamental changes, experts said. While a car manufacturer would face stiff penalties for faulty brakes, a software provider can often issue another update and move on.
“Until software companies have to pay a price for faulty products, we will be no safer tomorrow than we are today,” Parenty said.

Full text: Regulation
Automaker Group Asks For Review of Safety Rule
A group representing major automakers asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to reconsider the rule issued in April requiring nearly all new cars and trucks by 2029 to have advanced automatic emergency braking systems.
The group representing automakers, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said, that the requirement adopted in April that all cars and trucks would be able to stop and avoid striking vehicles in front of them at up to 62 miles per hour was "practically impossible with available technology." The traffic safety administration had no immediate comment.
Congress directed the agency, under the 2021 infrastructure law, to create a rule to establish minimum performance standards for automatic emergency braking systems, which use sensors to detect when a vehicle is close to crashing and then automatically applies brakes if the driver has not done so.

Pharmaceuticals
Novo Nordisk to Build
A New U.S. Facility
The drugmaker Novo Nordisk will spend $ 4.1 billion to build a U.S. facility to fill injection pens for its hugely popular weight-loss treatment Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic, it said on Monday.
Construction of the plant at Novo's existing main U.S. manufacturing site in Clayton, N.C., will be completed between 2027 and 2029, the Danish company said. Novo opened the site 31 years ago.
Novo said late last year that it was working to increase its in-house capacity to fill the injection pens at some manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe.
Booming demand for Wegovy in the United States and 10 other markets has propelled Novo's shares to record highs and the company last year overtook LVMH to become Europe's most valuable listed company. But the success has left Novo facing shortages and forced to limit the number of patients taking the once-weekly injection. Reuters

UPS Says It Will Sell
A Division at a Loss
United Parcel Service said on Sunday that it agreed to sell its Coyote Logistics division to RXO for a little more than $ 1 billion -- less than it paid for the freight-brokerage company in 2015 -- to focus more on its core package-delivery business.
UPS said that it expected to close the sale by the year if regulators allow the deal, and that it would update its financial outlook once the sale was completed.
Freight brokers serve as middlemen between shippers and carriers such as UPS.
RXO, a freight broker based in Charlotte, N.C., said acquiring Coyote would nearly double the company, to $ 7.1 billion in annual revenue, and make it the third-biggest freight broker in North America.
UPS paid $ 1.8 billion to buy Coyote from the private-equity firm Warburg Pincus as it looked to expand in the booming freight-brokerage business.

Nvidia's 6.7% Tumble Drags Wall Street to a Mixed Close: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nvidias-6-7-tumble-drags-wall-street-mixed-close/docview/3071657085/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Another slide for the Wall Street heavyweight Nvidia kept U.S. indexes mixed on Monday, even as the majority of stocks rallied.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to pull further from its record set last week. The drops for Nvidia and other winners of Wall Street's artificial-intelligence boom pulled the Nasdaq composite down 1.1 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 260 points, or 0.7 percent.
Stocks of oil-and-gas companies were among the market's strongest, as seven out of every 10 stocks in the S&P 500 rose. Exxon Mobil climbed 3 percent, and oil field services provider SLB gained 4 percent as oil prices hung near their highest levels since April.
Financial companies were also strong. JPMorgan Chase added 1.3 percent, and Wells Fargo climbed 1.6 percent ahead of results coming later in the week for tests by the Federal Reserve of how big banks would fare in a recession.
But declines for a handful of high-profile stocks offset all of those gains, and the spotlight shone brightest on Nvidia's 6.7 percent tumble. It was a third straight drop for the chip company, which had rocketed 1,000 percent higher since the autumn of 2022.
Nearly insatiable demand for Nvidia's chips to power artificial-intelligence applications have been a big reason for the U.S. stock market's run to records recently, even as the economy's growth slows under the weight of high interest rates. But the A.I. boom has been so frenzied that it has raised worries about a possible bubble in the stock market and too-high expectations among investors.
Nvidia's stock has been receding since it briefly overtook Microsoft as Wall Street's most valuable last week, and it is down nearly 13 percent in just three days. Because Nvidia has become so huge, the movements for its stock carry extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. It was the heaviest weight by far on the S&P 500 on Monday.
Other A.I. beneficiaries also gave up some of their fantastic gains. Super Micro Computer dropped 8.6 percent to shave its gain so far for the year back below 200 percent, to 190.9 percent.
Such a rotation among stocks could actually be a healthy sign for the market, as long as it can stay close to its records. Market watchers have been worried to see just Nvidia and a few other companies responsible for much of the S&P 500's returns recently. They would prefer a market where many stocks are participating in the gains.
RXO jumped 23 percent after it agreed to buy the Coyote Logistics freight brokerage business from UPS for nearly $ 1.03 billion. RXO said the deal will make it North America's third-largest provider of brokered transportation. UPS, which bought Coyote in 2015 for $ 1.8 billion, rose 1.5 percent.
Under Armour swung from an early loss to a gain of 2 percent after saying it agreed to pay $ 434 million to settle charges raised by shareholders related to its accounting and sales practices. The shoe and athletic wear company denied any wrongdoing in the settlement, but it also agreed to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive for at least three years.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 16.75 points to 5,447.87. The Dow rose 260.88 to 39,411.21, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 192.54 to 17,496.82.
In the bond market, Treasury yields eased a bit. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.23 percent from 4.26 percent late Friday.
It's been mostly falling since topping 4.70 percent in late April, which has relaxed the pressure on the stock market. Yields have sunk on hopes that inflation is slowing enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate later this year.
The Fed has been keeping the federal funds rate at the highest level in more than 20 years, hoping to grind down on the economy just enough to get inflation under control.

The Right's Favorite Zombie Law: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, it was hard for feminists to get Americans to take the threat of losing the constitutional right to abortion seriously. Describing Hillary Clinton's inability, in 2016, to shake pro-choice voters out of their complacency, The New York Times's Lisa Lerer and Elizabeth Dias wrote, "Internal campaign polling and focus groups showed that the issue did not resonate strongly with key groups of voters, because they did not believe Roe was truly at risk."
It is similarly difficult to get Americans to appreciate the threat that the 19th-century Comstock Act could be resurrected. Named colloquially for the fanatical postal inspector Anthony Comstock, the 1873 act -- which is actually a set of anti-vice laws -- bans the mailing of "obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile" material, including devices and substances used "for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral purpose." Though never repealed, it was, until recently, considered a dead letter, made moot by Supreme Court decisions on free speech, birth control and abortion.
But with Roe overturned, some in Donald Trump's orbit see a chance to reanimate Comstock, using it to ban medication abortion -- and maybe surgical abortion as well -- without passing new federal legislation.
The 920-page blueprint for a second Trump administration created by Project 2025, a coalition of conservative organizations, calls for enforcing Comstock's criminal prohibitions against using the mail -- widely understood to include common carriers like UPS and FedEx -- to provide or distribute abortion pills. Some MAGA legal minds believe that Comstock could also be wielded to prevent the mail from transporting tools used in surgical abortions. "We don't need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books," Jonathan F. Mitchell, a crusading anti-abortion lawyer who represented Trump before the Supreme Court this year, told Lerer and Dias in February.
Conservatives know this would be enormously unpopular, which is probably why, when they talk about Comstock at all, they often refer to it by its criminal code numbers rather than its common name. ("I think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election," said Mitchell.) Democrats, by contrast, need to be doing everything possible to make "Comstock" a household word. That's why they should champion a bill introduced by Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota on Thursday to overhaul the Comstock Act. And it's why President Biden would be wise to act on a petition from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression to posthumously pardon one of Comstock's high-profile victims.
Many were shocked when the Supreme Court overturned Roe two years ago, but as Smith, the former vice president of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, told me, they shouldn't have been, because the right made no secret of its objectives. There is something similar going on with Comstock. "Believe them when they tell us what they want to do, because they will do it if they're given half a chance," she said.
But getting people to believe them is a challenge. A substantial number of voters in swing states don't even understand the role Trump played in Roe's demise: According to a New York Times poll released last month, 17 percent of them blame Biden, since the ruling happened during his presidency. In Rolling Stone, Anat Shenker-Osorio, a senior adviser to the progressive Research Collaborative, wrote that in surveys and focus groups, disaffected Democrats and swing voters are appalled when they learn of Project 2025's agenda, including on abortion. But a mere 21 percent of them think Republicans will actually carry it out it if they take back power. And they wonder, if the danger of Project 2025's policies is so acute, "why Democrats don't seem to be speaking out about them or fighting back."
A messaging bill like Smith's Stop Comstock Act cannot on its own awaken the electorate to what's in store for us if a second Trump victory sweeps his emboldened Christian nationalist allies into power. But it can be part of a campaign to communicate the election's stakes. Smith knows that her bill won't get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster; this is a Senate, after all, where all but two Republicans voted against the Right to Contraception Act this month. But, she says, her bill is "such a clear organizing tool for showing people, including people who live in states like mine, or Nevada, for example," that even if their reproductive rights are protected now by state law, a future Trump administration could "wipe that away."
While the Stop Comstock Act may never reach Biden's desk, there's something he can do this moment to strike a public blow against the zombie law: pardon D.M. Bennett, a freethinking publisher and one of Comstock's nemeses, who in 1879 was sentenced to 13 months of hard labor for mailing an anti-marriage tract called "Cupid's Yokes." Petitioning the Biden administration, Robert Corn-Revere, chief counsel to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, wrote, "By granting this pardon, the president would help right the injustice resulting from D.M. Bennett's wrongful prosecution and conviction, and at the same time send the important message that Victorian-era laws should not be revived to undermine Americans' individual rights."
The message would, in fact, go further. It's not just that laws from the 1800s shouldn't be brought back to life, but that if Biden isn't re-elected, they could be.

Full text: A reader who was made to choose a college based on price is struggling to understand her parents' support of her younger sister at an expensive private school.
My younger sister has decided to attend an expensive private college. This surprised me: She was accepted at prestigious state schools with scholarships, which would be more affordable for our parents, who are footing the bill. When my brother and I went to college several years ago, such an expensive school would have been out of the question. We also had to take out small loans, which my parents are not asking our sister to do. Their financial situation hasn't changed, and I feel frustrated. I had to select a college based on price and take out loans; she doesn't have to do either. Should I raise this with my parents? They are kind and generous people, and I don't want to seem ungrateful. But I am still paying off the loans.
DAUGHTER
Before I get to your question, let me acknowledge your feelings: It is totally normal for siblings to notice -- and even resent -- differences in treatment by their parents. My guess is that, even if your parents' finances haven't changed, the weight of educating three children has begun to lift from their shoulders. That's a big relief! And it may have colored their approach to helping out your younger sister.
So, what do you want here? The measured tone of your letter -- including your description of your parents as "kind and generous" -- doesn't suggest that you're spoiling for a fight with them or even struggling under the weight of your small loans. And it seems punitive to ask them to renege on an agreement they already made with your sister.
Sometimes, it's enough to hear an acknowledgment that we've been treated unequally. Or you may want to ask them for some help repaying your loans. Think about it. But you're off to a good start, in my view, by framing this question in the context of your parents' love and kindness.
A Special Relationship, Blooming in a Barbershop
I am a gay man. My barber, who is straight and married with children, has let me know he has feelings for me. He often says that we're of "kindred spirit." And the last time I was in, he told me he likes lilies and tulips. I said, "Tulips are special, and you are my tulip." He replied: "And you are my lily." Am I reading too much into these exchanges? So far, he has declined my invitations to spend time together outside of the barbershop. Should I be patient with him or find another barber?
W.
The only two people who know whether there are romantic vibes between you and your barber are the two of you. Based on what you've reported, though, I see a friendship (with a touch of flirtation) -- not the desire of a man to leave his wife and children for you.
Many kindred spirits have platonic relationships, and you started the gooey floral analogy -- though, in fairness, he finished it up. But he has also declined your social invitations. If you can reboot your feelings as friendly ones here, I would. If not, find another barber.
I Got Your Gift! (Beat.) Thanks!
I am a firm believer in handwritten thank-you notes. I send them within a couple of weeks of receiving a gift. I am about to have a baby and have received many lovely presents. The problem: Many givers text me to check the delivery status of their gifts. I understand their concerns, but I'm not sure how to respond: Acknowledge the gift, but save the effusive thanks for the handwritten note? Or send two thank-you notes -- one by text and one by mail?
MOTHER-TO-BE
I am the last person to knock handwritten thank-you notes. They can mean a lot to gift givers. But they were never meant to give real-time reassurance that UPS actually made delivery. So, I suggest you use your good judgment here: If a pal from work sends you a couple of onesies from an online retailer and texts you about delivery three days later, do you really need to send her two thank-you notes -- one by text and one handwritten? Personally, I'd go all out in your text reply.
On the other hand, if your grandmother sends you a quilt she made by hand and asks about delivery, I think you should respond to her call or text right away. Tell her it arrived, it's beautiful and you'll send a note soon. Then follow up with a lovely one. The digital age gives us lots of options. Choose the one that fits the circumstances.
Keeping a Dress-Code Lapse in Perspective
My husband and I hosted our daughter's wedding in our upscale California beach town. The dress code was "festive cocktail attire." It was a fabulous event for 170 people, with one weird exception: My husband's 76-year-old sister showed up wearing white jeans, casual sandals and a shirt you'd wear to go shopping. She stood out like a sore thumb and was a topic of much speculation. Should we say something?
MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
Hang on! You gave a killer wedding, and the only problem was what your sister-in-law wore? Take the win and move on! The role of a host at any social occasion is to make her guests feel welcome and comfortable, even if -- especially if -- they make questionable wardrobe choices. Let this go.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on X.

Unions Join in Fight for Amazon Workers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer.
After years of organizing Amazon workers and pressuring the company to bargain over wages and working conditions, two prominent unions are teaming up to challenge the online retailer.
The partnership was made final after members of the Amazon Labor Union, the only union formally representing Amazon warehouse workers in the United States, overwhelmingly chose to affiliate with the 1.3-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters in voting that ended Monday. The vote was overseen by the Amazon union.
The A.L.U. scored a surprise victory in an election at a Staten Island warehouse in 2022. But it has yet to begin bargaining with Amazon, which continues to contest the election outcome. Leaders of both unions said the affiliation agreement would put them in a better position to challenge Amazon and would provide the A.L.U. with more money and staff support.
"The Teamsters and A.L.U. will fight fearlessly to ensure Amazon workers secure the good jobs and safe working conditions they deserve in a union contract," Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters president, said in a statement early Tuesday.
Amazon declined to comment on the affiliation.
The Teamsters are ramping up their efforts to organize Amazon workers nationwide. The union voted to create an Amazon division in 2021, and Mr. O'Brien was elected that year partly on a platform of making inroads at the company.
The Teamsters told the A.L.U. that they had allocated $ 8 million to support organizing at Amazon, according to Christian Smalls, the A.L.U. president, and that the larger union was prepared to tap its more than $ 300 million strike and defense fund to aid in the effort. The Teamsters did not comment on their budget for organizing at Amazon.
The Teamsters also recently reached an affiliation agreement with workers organizing at Amazon's largest airplane hub in the United States, a Kentucky facility known as KCVG. Experts have said unionizing KCVG could give workers substantial leverage because Amazon relies heavily on the hub to meet its one- and two-day shipping goals.
David Levin, staff director for Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a reform group within the union that helped mobilize United Parcel Service workers during last year's successful contract campaign, said many Teamsters members who were involved in pressuring UPS were now helping Amazon workers organize.
"Worker-leaders and activists are coming out of the UPS contract campaign and getting involved in building Amazon volunteer organizing committees," Mr. Levin said.
Efforts to unionize Amazon over the past decade have been scattered across a variety of established unions and independent worker groups. Some experts argue that given the company's size and longstanding opposition to unions, establishing a significant union presence there will require some consolidation of the organizing.
"We've had these different efforts, all these different pockets, that yielded some important breakthroughs," said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies labor. "But they also revealed the limitations of having a diffuse approach."
The affiliation agreement with the Teamsters, a copy of which was shared with The New York Times, stipulates that the A.L.U. will have the exclusive right within the Teamsters to organize additional Amazon warehouse workers in New York City and promises to help the new local with organizing, research, communications and legal representation.
It also gives the A.L.U. a role in the Teamsters' broader Amazon organizing, stating that at least three members of the local will take part in "executive planning and strategy discussions" of the Teamsters' Amazon division, and that the local will "lend its expertise to assist in organizing other Amazon facilities" across the country.
The A.L.U. energized the labor movement with its victory in 2022, but it soon encountered major challenges. It lost a union election at a nearby warehouse on Staten Island a few weeks later and another election at a warehouse near Albany, N.Y., that fall.
The union began to fracture after the second loss, with several A.L.U. organizers raising concerns that the union's leaders had too much power and were unaccountable to members. Mr. Smalls asserted that the union was worker-led.
An A.L.U. dissident group critical of Mr. Smalls filed a lawsuit in 2023 seeking to force leadership elections. The two sides announced a settlement in January, and elections are scheduled for the summer, to be overseen by a monitor approved by a federal court. Mr. Smalls is not a candidate, while the dissident group, the A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus, is fielding candidates for all four leadership positions. The slate is led by Connor Spence, an A.L.U. founder.
In the meantime, the A.L.U. has faced financial difficulties and ended last year with $ 33,000 in assets and $ 81,000 in liabilities, according to federal filings.
In May, both A.L.U. factions visited the Teamsters headquarters in Washington, where Teamsters officials pitched them on the idea of affiliating, Mr. Smalls said.
He said the Teamsters had offered to make their resources available to Amazon workers -- including strike pay -- while largely preserving the Amazon union's independence. He signed the affiliation agreement in early June.
The signing surprised the reform caucus, which had told the Teamsters that A.L.U. members would need more time to deliberate. But the caucus ultimately decided to back affiliation as long as A.L.U. members ratified it, saying it would help "turn the beachhead we've secured in Staten Island into a militant, autonomous local."
Mr. Spence, the reform caucus candidate for A.L.U. president, said that if his group won the leadership election on Staten Island, it would put together a plan to take on Amazon in consultation with workers and present the plan to the Teamsters in hopes of securing the necessary resources.
Amazon fired Mr. Spence last fall for what it said were violations of its policy governing off-duty access to its facilities. He is challenging the firing in a case that is before an administrative judge with the National Labor Relations Board.
Mr. Spence and another fired Amazon worker were removed by the police last week after they appeared in front of the warehouse trying to persuade workers to ratify the affiliation agreement. Officers handcuffed the two former workers, took them to a station and gave them tickets requiring a court appearance.
Lisa Levandowski, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company had called the police because a group, mostly Teamsters, was creating a disturbance outside the warehouse and had rebuffed Amazon's request to leave. She said that after the police arrived, all but Mr. Spence and his former co-worker had left. (Employees are allowed to distribute material outside the building during off hours.)
Mr. Spence said he had appeared in front of the building many times for organizing purposes in recent weeks without encountering the police.

The Gun Lobby’s Secret Weapon in Legal Battles

Full text: Enlarge this image.
In the battle to dismantle gun restrictions, raging in America’s courts even as mass shootings become commonplace, one name keeps turning up in the legal briefs and judges’ rulings: William English, Ph.D.
A little-known political economist at Georgetown University, English conducted a largest-of-its-kind national survey that found gun owners frequently used their weapons for self-defense. That finding has been deployed by gun rights activists to notch legal victories with far-reaching consequences.
He has been cited in a landmark Supreme Court case that invalidated many restrictions on guns, and in scores of lawsuits around the country to overturn limits on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and the carrying of firearms. His findings were also offered in another Supreme Court case this term, with a decision expected this month.
English seems at first glance to be an impartial researcher interested in data-driven insights. He has said his “scholarly arc” focuses on good public policy, and his lack of apparent ties to the gun lobby has lent credibility to his work.
But English’s interest in firearms is more than academic: He has received tens of thousands of dollars as a paid expert for gun rights advocates, and his survey work, which he says was part of a book project, originated as research for a National Rifle Association-backed lawsuit, The New York Times has found.
He has also increasingly drawn scrutiny in some courts over the reliability and integrity of his unpublished survey, which is the core of his research, and his refusal to disclose who paid for it. Other researchers say that the wording of some questions could elicit answers overstating defensive gun use and that he cherry-picked pro-gun responses.
“I have been struck by the enormous attention and influence the William English paper has had,” said Joseph Blocher, co-director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University. “It just sort of came out of nowhere, posted online without going through formal peer review, and by a guy most of us had never heard of.”
English’s National Firearms Survey has figured prominently in a broad gun rights campaign that has transformed the law. The effort is driven by litigation and sometimes questionable scholarship, backed with millions of dollars in dark money flowing through nonprofits that often exist only on paper.
The lofty-sounding Center for Human Liberty, created just in time to file a 2021 pro-gun Supreme Court brief jointly with English, has no staff and uses a rent-by-the-hour office provider in Las Vegas. The Constitutional Defense Fund, with a UPS Store in Virginia as its address, has served as a conduit for anonymous donations to Second Amendment groups, law firms and English.
The Firearms Policy Coalition, the busiest litigant of gun cases in the country, has made extensive use of English’s survey, including introducing it in the Supreme Court case New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. English’s work was cited in multiple briefs in that case, as well as in oral arguments and Justice Samuel Alito’s concurring opinion.
The Bruen decision in 2022 upended Second Amendment law by sweeping away any modern-day gun restrictions that could not be tied to a historical antecedent. The ruling led to a surge in firearms cases — to an annual average of 680 today compared with 122 in the decade before. Pro-gun rulings have also risen: The 74 issued last year make up one-quarter of all such rulings since 2000, according to researchers at the University of Southern California. Courts have struck down restrictions on high-capacity magazines in Oregon, handgun purchases in Maryland and assault weapons in California.
While expert research has always played a role in litigation, the demand for it in Second Amendment cases has risen since Bruen, sometimes testing the traditional standards of evidence and argument in the nation’s courts.
A California judge upbraided gun rights plaintiffs in March for seeming to avoid having English testify about his survey, calling it “a clear violation of the federal rules of evidence.” In December, a judge in Colorado accused plaintiffs of trying to “paper over” another firearms expert’s lack of qualifications. Appeals court judges for the 7th Circuit in Chicago last year criticized pro-gun legal arguments by plaintiff’s counsel as illogical, unusual and “pretty weird.”
The Supreme Court itself is confronted with the consequences of its Bruen decision in the pending case of United States v. Rahimi, which considers whether guns can be denied to someone subject to a family violence protective order. The justices are expected to rule this month on whether the absence of such restrictions centuries ago — the test established in Bruen — invalidates them today.
Among those filing briefs on the pro-gun side was English. He cited results of his online survey of gun owners to claim that “guns save many lives each year” and that protective orders could deprive the falsely accused of their right to defend themselves.
The Times made multiple attempts to interview English, who teaches at Georgetown’s business school, but he declined through a university spokesperson. He also did not respond to a list of questions.
Government lawyers tried to talk with him in December, after his research surfaced in a Firearms Policy Coalition lawsuit seeking to overturn Washington state’s ban on assault weapons. But English did not respond to emails, phone calls or a certified letter, and a process server bearing a subpoena could not find him at the university or his home, where someone inside “looked at the door, then turned away,” according to court records.
Faced with efforts to compel his testimony, the pro-gun plaintiffs in the Washington case chose to drop all references to his research.
A Quiet Interest in Guns
On English’s curriculum vitae and websites, there is no mention of guns among his many scholarly pursuits.
He earned degrees in math, economics and political science from Duke and later studied ethics at Oxford. Before joining the Georgetown business school faculty in 2016, English, now 43, was a humanities research fellow at Harvard. His academic focus has been ethical behavior and public policy — among his research interests is “how to lie with data science.”
In his few public comments about firearms, he says he got the idea for his national survey while working on a book. He told The Washington Examiner that “it kind of dawned on me that there’s a real opportunity here just as a scholar to contribute to this literature,” and in a podcast for The Reload, a firearms news site, he said he had “been thinking about this project in some ways for, like, 30 years.”
But his interest in firearms goes beyond writing a book, which he has never published. Although it is not mentioned in his research papers or professional credentials, court records reveal that English served as an expert for pro-gun litigants in at least four lawsuits from 2018 to 2020, often charging $250 to $350 an hour.
In a 2019 deposition in one case, English expressed a personal interest in guns that included sports shooting, hunting and a lifetime NRA membership. He also said he had once brandished a gun to scare off an intruder at his home.
He said in the deposition that, without tenure, he was reluctant to go public with firearms research because it was a subject “some people find controversial.” Asked whether Georgetown administrators had questioned him about it, he said, “They don’t know about my interests in that.”
In another case, plaintiff’s lawyers asked him to survey Vermont gun owners. The lawsuit, backed by the NRA, challenged the state’s ban on high-capacity magazines. The plaintiffs sought to show that such magazines are popular, meeting the Supreme Court’s test of whether a firearm is in “common use” for lawful purposes, making it harder to restrict.
English, who testified that the plaintiffs’ lawyers paid him about $20,000 for his work, wrote a report in 2019 saying that an online questionnaire he devised showed that high-capacity magazines were popular among gun owners and useful for self-defense. The lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful. But his survey would have far-reaching consequences.
Useful Findings
English’s work emerged at what would be an opportune moment for gun rights advocates. The Supreme Court’s balance shifted in 2018 with the arrival of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who had established strong pro-gun credentials as an appellate judge. In the spring of 2020, he encouraged his colleagues to take on a case about how the Second Amendment applies outside the home, writing a concurring opinion as well as a more detailed memo to his colleagues, reviewed by the Times.
In April 2021, the court landed on Bruen, an NRA-backed challenge to a century-old New York law giving the state broad discretion over who could carry a handgun. By then, money was already pouring into gun rights organizations seeking to seize the moment. Much of it was untraceable, flowing through funds that serve as pass-throughs for billions of dollars to tax-exempt organizations every year.
One was Donors Trust, a so-called dark money group supporting conservative and libertarian causes. From 2020 to 2022, the group sent $11.8 million to the Constitutional Defense Fund, a pro-gun nonprofit whose website identifies none of its leaders and has a nonworking email address.
Tax filings show that the fund disbursed almost all the money for “Second Amendment defense,” including $715,000 to the Firearms Policy Coalition, $90,000 to an NRA official and $5.3 million to Cooper & Kirk, a law firm that has teamed up with both groups on gun cases and retained English in the Vermont lawsuit.
Also listed in the defense fund’s tax filings was a $58,750 grant to English at Georgetown. The university said it had no role, adding that faculty can “conduct independent research projects.”
Amid the established Second Amendment groups and experts filing briefs supporting the plaintiffs in Bruen, English soon appeared with his own, prepared by a law firm paid by the Constitutional Defense Fund. He filed it with the Center for Human Liberty, a nonprofit created a couple of months before by The Firearms Policy Coalition.
The coalition is a scrappy and aggressive litigation group, whose leader, Brandon Combs, once suggested that an assault weapons ban would lead to “armed resistance.” It has appeared in more court cases in recent years than the NRA, including through a legal brief cited in last week’s Supreme Court decision overturning a ban on bump stocks. Many of the coalition’s efforts involve English’s work.
English’s 2021 brief in the Bruen case debuted his “National Firearms Survey,” one of two gun studies he had posted just days earlier on the Social Science Research Network site, where virtually anyone can upload unpublished academic papers. In its introduction, he mentioned the Vermont survey, calling it a pilot that “served as a proof of concept for the national version,” but he described it simply as “part of a research project.”
He did not say it arose out of expert witness work in a pro-gun lawsuit, nor how the national survey was paid for, a standard disclosure in academic research.
In English’s findings, roughly one-third of 16,708 gun owners responded to an online questionnaire that they had used a firearm in self-defense; 30% reported having owned an AR-15-style rifle; and 48% said they had owned magazines holding more than 10 rounds. Together with the other paper he posted, asserting that carrying firearms in public did not increase crime, his work buttressed the pro-gun position in the Bruen case.
Questioning the Survey
English extrapolated from the survey responses that guns are used in self-defense 1.67 million times a year, a high figure that has resonated in the courts: A federal judge last year cited it as he invalidated California’s assault weapons ban.
Some experts consider it to be vastly overstated. In 2018, the Rand Corp. analyzed a similar claim from a 1990s study widely cited by gun rights activists, and concluded it was “not plausible.” Other estimates range widely, with several putting the annual number below 100,000.
The professor’s definition of self-defense was broad: Almost one-third of those who answered yes in the survey said they may have “verbally told someone” they had a gun, without showing one. In addition, the survey asked people if they had defended themselves with a gun ever in their lifetime, rather than during a defined period.
Dr. Matthew Miller, part of a team at Northeastern and Harvard universities that for years has conducted its own firearms survey, said some of English’s findings on self-defense “strain credulity” and his methodology yielded “absurd” estimates. Another researcher, Louis Klarevas of Columbia University, has criticized English’s work in expert reports for states defending against gun lawsuits and said he has not followed standard ethics practices for revealing funding sources.
“Disclosing survey sponsorship is vital to assuring that the survey was not designed or conducted to further the political or economic interests of particular entities,” Klarevas wrote last month in an Illinois case.
Other issues have also been raised. English did not detail how the online respondents were chosen or why they are representative of the country. And an examination of the raw data reveals that in reporting results, he omitted prefaces to survey questions, whose wording, according to some polling experts, essentially invited respondents to rebut supposed misconceptions about guns.
Elsewhere in his findings, English quotes about 30 gun owners attesting to the usefulness of large-capacity magazines for self-defense — but only two reported actually firing a gun, both at animals. He did not quote any of the hundreds of negative responses from gun owners, including: “There is no reason to have a magazine like that unless you’re fighting in a war.”
Turning Point
During oral arguments in Bruen, after Justice Stephen Breyer worried that creating a sweeping right to carry firearms in public could increase deaths of innocent people, the lead plaintiff’s lawyer, Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general, referred him to English’s work as a counterpoint.
“The English brief, I think, is really worth taking a look at,” he said.
There is no suggestion that English’s work alone tipped the balance in the justices’ deliberations, which included input from many experts and legal scholars. But his credentials and findings carried weight. At least five briefs cited his research.
The draft opinion that Justice Clarence Thomas circulated to his colleagues in February 2022 was sweeping, with the potential to outlaw many common gun-control measures. The majority was slow to sign on. Chief Justice John Roberts and Kavanaugh requested modifications, according to people familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because that process is intended to be secret.
By May, Thomas still had not mustered the five votes needed. Mass shootings that month in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, galvanized public attention anew on gun violence. It was not until June that his opinion prevailed, when Kavanaugh signed on but wrote his own more moderate concurrence, joined by the chief.
Alito’s concurrence went the other way: dismissing the significance of the Buffalo shooting, noting the New York law being overturned did not prevent it, and faulting Breyer for focusing only on research that concluded more guns in public contributed to more crime. There are other studies, Alito said, that suggest the opposite.
“See also Brief for William English et al,” he wrote.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lucy Yu wasn't sure if she had smoke in her lungs or was having an anxiety attack. She needed fresh air.
Five days earlier, on the Fourth of July, she had raced out of her bookstore in Manhattan's Chinatown as it filled with smoke. A fire had broken out in an upstairs apartment, threatening to destroy all she had built.
Now Ms. Yu was back, and had to face it. She had assembled a team of friends to pack up the books that weren't damaged beyond repair and put them in storage. By the last bag, she had pain in her chest.
She walked outside and sat down on a stoop next door, as her friends comforted her and brought her water.
Her once-vibrant store, Yu & Me Books, needed a gut renovation to remove mold and smoke residue. The ceiling was caving in, the furniture she had built was damaged, and the speaker system she had installed was shot. A single bulb hung, emitting light; she and her friends had to use flashlights in the basement. They had salvaged a few thousand books, but more than 1,400 were ruined.
The bookstore was Ms. Yu's first attempt at entrepreneurship, and she felt she had failed. She opened her store with about $ 45,000 in December 2021 as the neighborhood was rebounding from the pandemic shutdowns and reeling from a spate of anti-Asian attacks. It quickly became a literary hub that hosted first-time authors and held weekend bar nights, when bibliophiles sipped hard seltzers and wine. The store was profitable within four months.
All of that was up in the air now. Fire officials, seeing the damage, told her that it might take a year to reopen.
"It was the first time I cried -- I just completely lost it," Ms. Yu, then 28, said a few weeks after the fire in the first of a series of interviews. "It was such a roller coaster of emotions because I lost something that I poured everything into, which is something that I think at the time I didn't even have the space or bandwidth to grieve."
But Ms. Yu didn't have the luxury to dwell on these feelings. New books came out every week, meaning each day was one when an author could choose another shop to host a talk or a shopper could defect to Amazon or Barnes & Noble. Without her brick-and-mortar location, and only a minuscule e-commerce operation, she had to get creative. It required soliciting financial lifelines and testing out new store concepts. It became her life.
It would take her 208 days -- a little more than half the expected time -- to restore her shop. In the process, she would find that elements of the bookstore wouldn't be exactly the same as they were before and that neither was she. Opening her store a second time meant reinventing not only the business, but also herself.
She stood up from the stoop and got to work.
2,400 Donors in One Day
In the days after the fire, Ms. Yu had totaled her losses and expenses: She was out about $ 60,000 worth of inventory. The ceiling's collapse destroyed the heating, cooling and ventilation system, so that needed replacing, too.
Initially she estimated she'd need $ 80,000 to rebuild, which didn't include paying her nine employees, which she had resolved to do. A friend told her to be realistic and nearly double her estimate. She filed a claim with her insurance company, but knew she'd need funds sooner.
Ms. Yu thought about the crowdfunding site GoFundMe, but was hesitant. A few years earlier, she had used the platform to raise about $ 16,000 to start Yu & Me. What would people think when she said she needed their help again?
Her friend and colleague Kazumi Fish reminded her that Yu & Me had come to mean something to others as well.
Within a day, more than 2,400 people donated a total of $ 231,152 to Ms. Yu's new GoFundMe campaign. (The campaign eventually raised $ 369,555.)
Donations came from the authors Celeste Ng and Vanessa Chan (each gave $ 5,000) and the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel (it poured in $ 2,000). Local bookstores donated, too. As did scores of people who gave just $ 10.
Ms. Yu stuck to her revised $ 150,000 budget, and set the extra money aside for future emergencies.
Before any rebuilding, she needed city approval for the work, such as the installation of plumbing and electricity. She worked with her landlord's architect to seek permits quickly, and hired a contractor who explained the next steps.
After long days spent doing store inspections and talking to other entrepreneurs in Chinatown who had dealt with fires, she would return to her one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment, which was filled with mismatched furniture, books and records, and binge-watch home-improvement TV shows like "Hack My Home" and "Hoarder House Flippers."
The shows taught her which colors clash and how to make a room feel bigger. Murphy bookshelves and nooks could create a homey feel. She sketched drawings to show her contractor.
"I wish I had known other people that had designed spaces," Ms. Yu said. "But I was like, 'This is just something I'm going to have to do.' And that's why HGTV was my resource during this time."
By the fall, construction was in full swing at her cavernous store. The wires that hung from the ceiling were tucked and covered by drywall. The floors were stripped to their concrete base, and the walls in the basement had been torn away to expose the brick.
A Temporary Home
A month after the fire, the Market Line Food Hall, about a mile from her store, offered a basement spot for her business. It was only about three-quarters the size of her original location, but provided a steady address that people could find on Google. While not disclosing terms, Ms. Yu said she had negotiated a favorable lease because Market Line expected Yu & Me to generate foot traffic.
Over Labor Day weekend, Ms. Yu, her employees and her friends worked to replicate Yu & Me in the temporary space. They assembled Ikea furniture, painted walls, pulled the books out of storage and bought new ones from distributors. Ms. Yu spent $ 3,000 on construction fees and $ 10,000 on books. On opening day, the 774-square-foot space was crowded with well-wishers who told her that she had outdone herself by recreating the store's living-room vibe.
"I'm probably going to be really good at opening bookstores at the end of this," she quipped.
But it wasn't the same. Bookstores rely on serendipitous foot traffic. This shop was on the lower level at Market Line, while most of the action was upstairs, where people grabbed a pizza or a beer before heading out. Ms. Yu couldn't use her liquor or food license for this location, so she couldn't stage the bar nights that had reliably drawn in customers.
While she encouraged patrons to grab a drink within the food hall and then come back to her store, "it was not super common," she said. Then she paused and conceded: "It did not happen. It did not happen maybe at all. Not one time."
Revenue declined 40 percent from a year earlier.
Yu & Me employees realized they needed to improvise. They started a "blind date" book concept. They wrapped some books in brown butcher paper, added pithy descriptions like "Generational Women Piecing Together Fabrics of Their Life" (real title: "Owner of a Lonely Heart") and priced them slightly lower.
A colleague started displaying some smaller books on the shelves with the covers facing out after realizing that people bought books more consistently when they saw covers instead of spines.
Sales finally started to increase, and Ms. Yu vowed to apply some of the lessons at her original store once it reopened.
"At the beginning I was so mad at myself," she said. "But I think I can't expect to adapt and transition and not have to rework the whole process to a new one."
It was a statement that could have described other parts of her life as well. In her unceasing effort to rebuild -- everything was scheduled down to the hour -- her personal life had gotten out of whack. She hadn't taken time to process her feelings about the fire. At inopportune moments, memories of it would shake her. Some days, she'd have to walk away for hours.
"I get really overwhelmed with thoughts of the fire and thoughts of sifting through and seeing my business burned down," she said. "I think I used to white-knuckle, brute-force my way through and just be like: 'You are not sad right now. You're not stressed out. You're going to just keep pushing through.' I really thought I could skirt around the sadness."
Controlling what she could, she trimmed her shoulder-length hair every few months into what became a pixie cut just above her ears. (Shorter hair also saved her time.)
Ms. Yu's tight circle of friends pushed her to eat, rest and celebrate herself, especially when her birthday and the store's second anniversary rolled around.
"I can see how it would be easy to feel alone in this situation because at the end of the day, she is the sole owner of this store," Ms. Fish said.
As Lunar New Year neared, Ms. Yu yearned to return to her Chinatown store. She resolved to reopen it by the end of January. Plus, in early February, Market Line announced that it would close in April.
The Homecoming
The days preceding the reopening were chaotic. On Instagram, Yu & Me's page advertised the event with memes and emojis. Behind the scenes, employees scrambled to get enough books to fill the store.
Ms. Yu had ordered thousands of titles, asking that they be shipped to Market Line because the original store was still under construction. But the carrier, UPS, seeing that her Market Line location was vacant, returned the shipments. After reordering them -- this time to Yu & Me -- she slept at the store, waiting for them to arrive.
On the last Sunday in January, Ms. Yu, now 29, opened the door to Yu & Me. It was dark and rainy, but patrons immediately and consistently flowed in.
The first was Henry Rivere, a customer who said that he was there to support an Asian-owned business and that he had been following the store's story on social media. The author Min Jin Lee swung by to give Ms. Yu a hug, saying she was moved that the entrepreneur hadn't given up on her dream. Gloria Moy, an upstairs neighbor who was also displaced for months after the fire, was excited to see the diverse range of customers coming into Chinatown.
"I can't describe it," Ms. Moy, 63, said. "To have the community come together, raise everybody up, rise from the ashes just in time for New Year's."
Friends with bouquets wriggled past the long line of customers. Pedro Ramirez bought $ 265 worth and a blue Yu & Me cap that he wore out of the store.
She had set low expectations for sales. But a month after the opening, her revenue was 50 percent more than it was before the fire. The bar nights are back, too.
Ms. Yu is now giving herself more time to read and reflect. Sitting inside the red nook, which was inspired by the hours of home-improvement binge-watching, she reflected on a line by the novelist Tayari Jones at the end of "Silver Sparrow": "People say, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger. But they are wrong. What doesn't kill you, doesn't kill you. That's all you get."
She paused. Then her eyes welled with tears.
"It's so true," Ms. Yu said. "There's been so many times in this last year where I feel like something in me is dying and I'm still here. It didn't kill me. It didn't kill me."

The Floating Traffic Jam That Freaked Us Out: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Southern California appeared to be under siege from a blockade.
More than 50 enormous vessels bobbed in the frigid waters of the Pacific Ocean, marooned off the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. As days stretched into weeks, they waited their turn to pull up to the docks and disgorge their cargo. Rubberneckers flocked to the water's edge with binoculars, trying to count the ships that stretched to the inky horizon.
This was no act of war. This was what it looked like when the global economy came shuddering to a halt.
It was October 2021, and the planet had been seized by the worst pandemic in a century. International commerce was rife with bewildering dysfunction. Basic geography itself seemed reconfigured, as if the oceans had stretched wider, adding to the distance separating the factories of China from the superstores of the United States.
Given the scale of container ships -- the largest were longer than four times the height of the Statue of Liberty -- any single vessel held at anchor indicated that enormous volumes of orders were not reaching their intended destinations. The decks of the ships were stacked to the skies with containers loaded with the components of contemporary life -- from clothing and electronics to drums full of chemicals used to concoct other products like paint and pharmaceuticals.
Among the ships held in the queue was the CSCL Spring, a Hong Kong-flagged vessel that was carrying a whopping 138 containers from Yihai Kerry International, a major Chinese agricultural conglomerate. Together, they held 7.3 million pounds of canola meal pellets -- enough animal feed to sustain 20,000 cows for a week. Their delay was exacerbating shortages of feed afflicting livestock producers in the United States.
Five ships in this waylaid flotilla were collectively hauling 13 million pounds of Fiji bottled water. More than 17 million pounds of Heineken beer was held up. The Singaporean-flagged Wan Hai 625 was carrying almost three million pounds of polyethylene terephthalate resin, a key element for manufacturing synthetic fabrics and plastic bottles used to package soft drinks -- another commodity in short supply. The same ship held 5.2 million pounds of solar panels and 1.6 million pounds of material for chain-link fencing.
By one estimate, the ships waiting off Southern California's two largest ports were collectively loaded with more than $ 25 billion worth of goods. And this was a fraction of the wares stranded by a global breakdown that had reached staggering proportions. Nearly 13 percent of the world's container shipping fleet was floating off ports from China to North America to Europe. Upward of $ 1 trillion worth of product was caught in the congestion.
All of this stuff was supposed to be somewhere else.
But the docks were overwhelmed by an influx of containers as Americans stuck in quarantine outfitted themselves for the apocalypse, filling their basements with exercise bikes, their bedrooms with office furniture and their kitchens with baking equipment. Most of these goods were manufactured in Asia. The trucking industry complained that it could not hire enough drivers to move this tsunami of product. Warehouses were stuffed to the rafters and short of workers. The railroads -- hollowed out by years of corporate cost cutting -- were buckling in the face of a surge of demand.
For decades, the world had seemed compressed, the continents bridged by container ships, internet links and exuberant faith in globalization. Now, the earth again felt vast.
----
In the center of the pileup off Long Beach lay the Maersk Emden, a Danish-flagged container ship that stretched 1,200 feet long and 158 feet wide. Freshly arrived from the Chinese port of Ningbo, it was carrying roughly 12,000 containers.
Hagan Walker had only one box on board the Maersk Emden -- a 40-foot container logged in the shipping manifest as MSMU8771295. But it held the most important order in the brief history of his start-up.
Mr. Walker's company, Glo, was based in a small town in Mississippi. It made plastic novelty cubes that lit up when plunked in water. He had recently secured a breakthrough deal -- a contract to make bath toys for Sesame Street, including a figurine version of the iconic Elmo. He had planned to debut them during the pivotal holiday season, now only two months away.
Like millions of companies, Mr. Walker's operation depended on two crucial elements: factories in China to make its products and gigantic container ships to carry them to American shores. For decades, this had proved a cheap and reliable way to do business, the means by which major brands and niche players alike had kept the world's largest economy stocked with everything from oven cleaner to aircraft parts.
But that equation was unraveling, and Mr. Walker found himself confronting the mother of all traffic jams off the coast of Southern California.
As the calendar continued its relentless march toward the holiday season, his Elmo dolls were floating out on the water, castaways during the Great Supply Chain Disruption.
By the time the Maersk Emden joined the floating queue off Long Beach bearing Mr. Walker's shipment, people from Europe to Africa to North and South America had endured a terrifying scarcity of personal protective gear like face masks and medical gowns. This had forced frontline medical workers to attend to patients with Covid-19 absent adequate protection.
Society had experienced the disappearance of toilet paper from store shelves amid panicked hoarding. Women's sanitary products had become difficult to find, along with medicines like antibiotics and even aspirin. Meat display cases at supermarkets sat empty. For a time, Grape-Nuts, the popular breakfast cereal, all but vanished, along with the tapioca beads used to make boba tea.
Factories in Asia that manufactured computer chips could not keep pace with a substantial increase in demand, an emergency in an age in which chips had become the brains for all manner of devices. Auto factories from Japan to the United States to Brazil halted production, citing a lack of chips. American car dealers typically held two to three times as many vehicles as they sold in a month. By the end of 2021, their inventory had plunged to a record low -- less than half their volume of sales. And as new cars became scarce, the prices of used vehicles exploded.
Medical device manufacturers embarked on a largely futile campaign to shame chip companies into prioritizing their orders over those from smartphone companies like Apple and Google. Major electronics companies began covertly buying old toys and video gaming consoles, breaking apart ancient PlayStations and Barbie accessories to harvest the chips within.
For consumers who never previously had reason to contemplate the intricacies of the global supply chain, all of this was cosmically disconcerting. The shortages of goods conveyed a gut-level affirmation that contemporary life itself had gone haywire, exposing a dark and unsettling truth: No one was in control.
In wealthy countries, society had been steeped in the idea that the internet had transcended the traditional constraints of time and space. You could go online at any hour, on any day, no matter the weather, click here, and then wait for the truck to arrive with your order.
In a world full of grave uncertainty, here was a sure thing.
The supply chain was not just the circulatory system for goods, but also the source of a sense of authority over human circumstance, and a rare unifying aspect of modern existence. In a time of flagging faith in government, skepticism about news media and suspicion of corporate motives, everyone could at least believe in the unseen forces that brought the UPS guy to the door. The links connecting farms, factories and distribution centers to households and businesses had seemed inviolate.
As the supply chain began fraying, urban reality from Minneapolis to Milan was dominated by the ceaseless wailing of ambulances hauling those stricken with Covid-19 to hospitals, where people were dying on gurneys stashed in corridors, the rooms overflowing, the supply of ventilators exhausted. From San Francisco to Stockholm, people were taking their last breaths alone in nursing homes, without saying goodbye to their children and grandchildren. Every day brought grim reports of a rising tide of death that eventually took the lives of nearly seven million people worldwide.
----
Over recent decades, multinational companies from North America to Europe to Japan had placed their fate in a ruthless sort of efficiency. They had steadily entrusted production to factories around the globe, and especially to plants in China, chasing lower costs and fatter profits.
And they had behaved as if this strategy was devoid of risk, as if China's industrial parks might as well have been extensions of Ohio and Bavaria. They either did not know or did not care that the shipping industry was basically a cartel, operating largely beyond the oversight of any government watchdog.
Once their products reached American shores, companies relied on transportation networks that depended on millions of workers who submitted to dangerous and lonely jobs, even as their pay and working conditions were downgraded. In constructing a supply chain governed by the relentless pursuit of efficiency, trucking and railroad businesses treated their workers as if their own time was both limitless and without value, deserving of no compensation for hours stuck waiting for the next load.
From the railroads to trucking firms to warehouses, major companies in the supply chain had long treated their workers as costs to be contained rather than human beings with families, medical challenges and other demands. Employers assumed that they did not have to worry about running out of laborers, even as they engaged in wanton exploitation. At the same time, decades of zealous reverence for deregulation as the solution to nearly every problem served to cede economic fate to a handful of companies that dominated key industries.
In Washington, both major political parties had long placed faith in the fantastical notion that gigantic companies left to seize commanding holds over their markets would yield greater efficiency
The pandemic laid bare the consequences of relying on faraway factories and container ships to keep humanity supplied with goods.
It exposed as reckless the world's heavy dependence on a single country -- China -- for critical products like protective gear and medicine, especially as Washington and Beijing were locked in a trade war.
It revealed the risks of leaning on transportation systems staffed by people whose wages and working conditions had been decimated by cost cutting.
Unregulated behemoths left to dominate markets in the name of efficiency turned out to yield results that were efficient only on Wall Street.
And then broad chaos in the global supply chain helped deliver another economic affliction: inflation.
By early 2022, in the name of snuffing out price increases, central banks around the world would begin lifting interest rates. This would foist higher borrowing costs on homeowners and credit card holders. It would threaten ordinary workers with joblessness while depressing stock prices. Though economists debated the causes of inflation, part of the blame clearly fell on the reality that astonishing quantities of goods were stuck floating off ports.
----
By early 2023, the worst disruptions of the pandemic years had subsided. The floating traffic jams had all but disappeared, shipping rates had plunged and product shortages had eased. Yet the same foundational perils remained, awaiting an inevitable future disturbance.
The global economy has entered a new era of enduring volatility. As climate change alters the natural realm, the global supply chain will be subject to new rules and a constant reassessment of risks. Russia's assault on Ukraine has enhanced the prospect of the world's splintering into rival camps, complicating the geography of international trade. China and the United States appear locked in a cold war whose consequences are playing out around the globe, reshaping alliances, trade pacts and fundamental understandings about the nature of international engagement.
To meet the challenge of the next disturbance, which we can be certain is coming, we need to grapple with how we got here. We need to understand how the supply chain became so complex, extended and centered on a single country. And we must reconfigure the supply chain to safeguard society through greater resilience.
The globalization to which we have become accustomed was propelled by an especially intoxicating form of efficiency, a concept known as Just in Time, or lean manufacturing.
But the shortages of the pandemic have prompted some companies to recalibrate, building up inventories as they pivot from Just in Time to Just in Case.
As the United States and China treat each other like rival powers, multinational companies have shifted some factory production to other countries like Vietnam. American businesses are setting up factories in Mexico and Central America to retain low-cost manufacturing without having to contend with the vagaries of the Pacific Ocean. And some companies are embracing so-called reshoring, bringing factory production back to the United States.
At the end of the harrowing journey of the past four years lies one singular truth: Humanity has come to depend on a disorganized and rickety global supply chain for access to the products of our age, from lifesaving drugs and computer chips to toys and games. The system relies on myriad forms of labor exploitation, which has made it perpetually vulnerable to breakdown. And it has been constructed as a means of rewarding the investor class, often at the expense of reliability.
The Great Supply Chain Disruption is not some curious piece of recent history. It is a preview of the dysfunction that surely lies ahead if we fail to get the machine in order.

Why Unions Now Struggle To Expand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Teamsters union has made little headway in organizing workers at Amazon and FedEx despite wage and other gains it secured at UPS last year.
Last year, two unions representing workers at three large automakers and UPS negotiated new labor contracts that included big raises and other gains. Leaders of the unions -- the United Automobile Workers and the Teamsters -- hoped the wins would help them organize workers across their industry.
The U.A.W. won one vote to unionize a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee last month and lost one this month at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama. The Teamsters have made even less progress at UPS's big nonunion rivals in the delivery business, Amazon and FedEx.
Polling shows that public support for unions is the highest it has been in decades. But labor experts said structural forces would make it hard for labor groups to increase their membership, which is the lowest it has been as a percentage of the total work force in decades. Unions also face stiff opposition from many employers and conservative political leaders.
The Teamsters provide an instructive case study. Many of the workers doing deliveries for Amazon and FedEx work for contractors, typically small and medium-size businesses that can be hard to organize. And delivery workers employed directly by FedEx in its Express business are governed by a labor law that requires unions to organize all similar workers at the company nationally at once -- a tougher standard than the one that applies to organizing employees at automakers, UPS and other employers.
Some labor experts also said the Teamsters had not made as forceful a push as the U.A.W. to organize nonunion workers after securing a new contract with UPS.
"You didn't have that energy that you saw with the U.A.W.'s leaders," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Teamsters officials said the UPS deal, which increases the average annual compensation, including benefits, of a UPS driver to $ 170,000 from $ 145,000, was helping them gain members. At DHL, a delivery company where the union has long had a big presence, the union added 1,100 members last year and is pushing to gain another 1,500. The Teamsters are also pursuing a legal challenge against Amazon that could allow them to gain ground at the company and its contractors.
"It's been very helpful for us to mobilize," Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters' president, said in an interview, referring to the UPS contract. "We've set the standard in the industry."
But the union has also suffered losses. Yellow, a trucking company that employed 24,000 Teamsters, shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Amazon and FedEx said they were confident in their approach to managing and compensating workers. Amazon said it had made investments that bolstered pay and benefits at its delivery contractors. FedEx said its nonunion model allowed it to quickly increase pay whereas UPS's union employees were bound by the terms of five-year contracts.
"Our culture, built and tested over 50 years, is based on the philosophy that if we take care of our people, they will deliver outstanding service for our customers, which will drive business results for our company," Tracy Brightman, FedEx's chief people officer, said in a statement.
Around 310,000 UPS employees belong to the Teamsters. Many of them see FedEx and Amazon drivers on their routes and talk about pay, benefits and working conditions.
"We make much more money than anyone else in the industry," said Essence Carlisle, a part-time package handler at UPS's hub in Louisville, Ky. "I definitely intend to make a career here."
The UPS deal gave part-time employees, over half the company's unionized work force, a 26 percent raise, to at least $ 21 per hour. Ms. Carlisle makes close to $ 24 an hour and works around 20 hours a week, giving her time to run a bakery on the side, she said. Her friends who have full-time driving jobs at Amazon make around $ 19 an hour, she said.
As big as the raises at UPS were, they did not increase pay by a lot more than inflation. The top wage rate immediately after the latest deal, $ 44.25 per hour, was 22 percent higher than five years earlier. Over that period, consumer prices rose 21 percent.
And UPS typically hires new union workers into part-time jobs, which they hold for a few years. As a result, some people may be unwilling to seek a job at the company.
Even so, last year's Teamsters contract was widely discussed online, spawning memes of UPS drivers arriving at customers' doors in designer clothing.
"Joking or not, everybody was like, 'Hey, man, I need a job at UPS,"' said Juan Martinez, a UPS driver in Southern California.
Under the new contract, Mr. Martinez expects to earn $ 110,000 to $ 120,000 a year, depending on how much overtime he gets, he said. He said his income allowed him to spend more on his children's education.
Under the Teamsters' deal with UPS, the top hourly wage will increase to $ 49 by the end of the five-year contract. Amazon said in January that the average pay of workers at its delivery contractors was $ 20.50 in the United States. FedEx declined to provide an average wage rate for its delivery workers.
Despite UPS's superior pay over the years, the Teamsters have not made many inroads at FedEx or Amazon.
The high turnover of delivery and warehouse workers at Amazon and FedEx -- where each part-time position was on average filled and vacated twice last year -- makes it difficult to organize them.
Another challenge is that delivery workers at Amazon, and drivers who deliver for FedEx Ground, are employed by contractors. Mr. Rosenfeld, the labor academic, said trying to organize a few dozen people at each contractor could be time consuming and costly.
Last year, 84 workers at an Amazon contractor near Los Angeles joined the Teamsters. But days earlier, Amazon terminated the contract with the operator, Battle-Tested Strategies, the company said, for failing to follow proper safety procedures, among other things.
The Teamsters asked the National Labor Relations Board to rule that Amazon was a joint employer of the workers and order the company to reinstate the contract. The board has yet to rule.
A favorable ruling would be "a massive deal" and an "inspiration for thousands of other workers across the country," said Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official.
Johnathon Ervin, the owner of Battle-Tested Strategies, said he believed Amazon had terminated the contract, which led to job losses for all his employees, because of the unionization effort. An Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Kate Paradis, disputed that.
Mr. Ervin said the minimum pay for his workers under the Amazon contract was $ 19.75. "If you are asking people to make this a career, you should have better work conditions and pay the drivers more," said Mr. Ervin, a 26-year Air Force veteran.
Amazon didn't respond directly to that criticism. The company noted that its contractors, which it refers to as delivery service partners, had created 279,000 driving jobs over the last five years.
"Helping D.S.P.s create a good overall working experience is important to us, which is why we've invested more than $ 8 billion in state-of-the-art technology, safety features, rates, programs and services for Amazon D.S.P.s and their drivers," Ms. Paradis said in a statement.
Labor groups have made some gains at Amazon, including organizing workers at a Staten Island warehouse. But Amazon is challenging the election there, and that union has been embroiled in infighting.
At FedEx there is another potential barrier to unionization.
FedEx was founded as an airline, and employees of its Express business come under the Railway Labor Act, which requires unions to organize nationally, across a whole company, at once. Union officials say it's easier to hold individual votes at each company location as allowed under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs workers at UPS and automakers.
Even so, some FedEx employees do belong to a union. Nearly 6,000 pilots at FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The Teamsters are trying to organize the mechanics who work on the company's planes.
FedEx said its delivery workers had benefited from not being in a union because the company raised wages significantly during the home-delivery boom of 2021 and 2022, when UPS workers' raises were set by an agreement reached before the pandemic. A FedEx spokeswoman noted that the company incurred an additional $ 1.4 billion in labor costs in its 2022 fiscal year.

Congestion Pricing Expected to Be a Tool, Not a Solution, in Fight Against Pollution: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Officials expect New York City's new tolling system to reduce air pollution, as well as carbon emissions. The impact may be uneven.
When congestion pricing takes effect in New York City next month, officials say it will create an array of benefits: The system's tolls will generate revenue for improving mass transit while prompting some drivers to avoid Manhattan, potentially reducing traffic and air pollution, as well as carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.
Some of those goals are already within sight: Devices that will monitor cars and send bills to drivers are in place, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which will operate the system, has begun to detail the transit repairs and upgrades it plans to spend its windfall on.
For now, though, it is unclear how much the program will contribute to New York State's ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse emissions 85 percent by 2050. And some people worry that less air pollution in some areas will be offset by more in others, despite efforts to keep that from happening.
According to an environmental assessment by the authority, congestion pricing could decrease air pollution overall in three boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. The concern is that rerouted traffic could increase it in the Bronx and on Staten Island.
"It's safe to say the direct air-quality benefits would be modest but measurable overall," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney and New York City environment director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The plan, he added, is worthwhile because of its benefits for public transit, whose health is crucial for luring people away from private vehicles.
"If you look at London and Stockholm, they had improved traffic, modest air quality, and jolts of adrenaline to their transportation systems," he said, referring to similar programs in those cities.
To counter a potential air pollution increase in the South Bronx and other parts of the region, government officials have committed $ 155 million to initiatives like an asthma center, improved ventilation in schools by highways and renovating parks and other green spaces.
But such measures are inadequate for the South Bronx, which has grappled with air pollution's effects for years, said Arif Ullah, the executive director of South Bronx Unite, a nonprofit that focuses on social, economic and environmental issues.
Mr. Ullah said his group supported congestion pricing in principle but opposed the current plan. The South Bronx, one of the areas that is projected to have more air pollution because of drivers avoiding the toll zone, already has high levels of congestion and toxins in the air, and high asthma rates.
"If we are getting more public transit with poorer air, it seems like a deal with the devil," said Assemblyman Kenny Burgos, a Democrat who represents a section of the southeast Bronx and opposes the current plan.
Mr. Burgos expressed concern about a possible increase in delivery trucks, which are among the worst polluters. He also mentioned the possibility that a major distribution center in the Manhattan congestion zone, like one operated by United Parcel Service on West 43rd Street, would route more deliveries through the Bronx to avoid tolls. A UPS spokesman said the company was considering the idea but had not made plans.
Pollution in the South Bronx should be addressed separately and aggressively, not used as a bargaining chip to push the program through or as an argument to shut it down, said Jacqueline Klopp, the director of Columbia University's Center for Sustainable Development and a congestion pricing supporter.
Concerns about the plan extend to New Jersey, where opponents have sued to block it from taking effect, complaining that environmental studies of its potential impact have not been adequate. Similar suits have been filed in New York courts. The system's start, which is scheduled for June 30, could be postponed based on the outcome of the lawsuits.
Under congestion pricing, most vehicles will be charged $ 15 to enter the area of Manhattan below 60th Street during the peak hours of 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. starting June 30. Trucks would pay $ 24 or $ 36 at peak hours, depending on their size.
The program is expected to generate $ 1 billion in annual revenue, which the authority plans to use to secure $ 15 billion in financing it needs for infrastructure work on the city's 119-year-old transit system.
Because climate change is putting even greater demands on that system, officials say, another $ 6 billion is needed for projects like elevating equipment, updating vents and building berms and flood walls to prepare for the effects of extreme weather.
Congestion pricing is predicted to reduce traffic in Manhattan's core about 17 percent, or about 120,000 vehicles a day, according to the mayor's office. The M.T.A. has offered one potential scenario under which particulate matter -- inhalable particles produced by burning fossil fuels, among other sources -- would decrease about 11 percent in the district.
The last time congestion and air pollution dropped significantly in New York was during the pandemic, when many drivers stopped coming into the city. Predictions about the effect congestion pricing will have pale in comparison to what happened when the city locked down, said Bob Pishue, an analyst with the global traffic and data analytics company Inrix. In 2021, traffic entering Manhattan below 14th Street was down 55 percent, he said.
In Stockholm, air pollution has declined since congestion pricing was introduced 18 years ago, said Jonas Eliasson, a director at the Swedish Transport Administration. He added that the improved air quality in Sweden's capital was also attributable to increasingly strict regulations for new trucks and cars and the growing presence of electric vehicles.
In London, congestion pricing has evolved since its introduction more than 20 years ago. Zone boundaries have expanded, fees have increased and regulations have tightened. Traffic, though reduced, continues to be a challenge, because of more people living there and more street space has gone to bicycle lanes and other alternative travel routes, said Kate Slevin, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban planning nonprofit in New York.
London's air quality has improved because of several initiatives, including congestion pricing and an "ultra low emission zone" program that charges fees to polluting vehicles that enter a designated area in London.
Last year, average particulate matter concentrations across London did not exceed the World Health Organization's interim guidelines for the first time, and nitrogen dioxide, a gas produced by burning fuel, was cut nearly in half from 2016 to 2023.
London is similar to New York City in that most greenhouse gas emissions there come from buildings. That could help explain why congestion pricing and other car-related regulations in London have helped to improve air quality, while meeting carbon emissions goals remains difficult.
Buildings, which are responsible for 70 percent of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions, also contribute to air pollution, said Talor Gruenwald, a data scientist at Rewiring America, a nonprofit that promotes electrification. That means reducing carbon emissions from buildings in dense cities may be a more powerful way to both improve air quality and to lower greenhouse gas emissions overall.
"Buildings and cars both emit fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide in similar quantities," Mr. Gruenwald said. Although the worst offenders are oil-powered buildings, buildings powered by natural gas also pollute the air, he added.
In 2017, buildings in New York produced 1,058 tons of particulate matter, compared with 849 tons from cars, according to an analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data by Mr. Gruenwald. In 2020, during the pandemic -- an era of reduced traffic and empty offices -- buildings still produced more particulate matter (531 tons, compared to 491 from cars).
Because New York City is so dense, residents are constantly exposed to fumes, whether from traffic or buildings, Mr. Gruenwald said. And since getting buildings and vehicles off fossil fuels will be a gradual process, he said, the city will need multiple policies to keep on track toward meeting its climate goals. Congestion pricing is one of those policies, he and other experts argue.
"It's another tool," said Ms. Klopp, of Columbia, "and we will need to hone it."

“Our culture, built and tested over 50 years, is based on the philosophy that if we take care of our people, they will deliver outstanding service for our customers, which will drive business results for our company,” Tracy Brightman, FedEx’s chief people officer, said in a statement,
Around 310,000 UPS employees belong to the Teamsters. Many of them see FedEx and Amazon drivers on their routes and talk about pay, benefits and working conditions.
“We make much more money than anyone else in the industry,” said Essence Carlisle, a part-time package handler at UPS’ hub in Louisville, Kentucky. “I definitely intend to make a career here.”
The UPS deal gave part-time employees, over half the company’s unionized workforce, a 26% raise, to at least $21 per hour. Carlisle makes close to $24 an hour and works around 20 hours a week, giving her time to run a bakery on the side, she said. Her friends who have full-time driving jobs at Amazon make around $19 an hour, she said.
As big as the raises at UPS were, they did not increase pay by a lot more than inflation. The top wage rate immediately after the latest deal, $44.25 per hour, was 22% higher than five years earlier. Over that period, consumer prices rose 21%.
And UPS typically hires new union workers into part-time jobs, which they hold for a few years. As a result, some people may be unwilling to seek a job at the company.
Even so, last year’s Teamsters contract was widely discussed online, spawning memes of UPS drivers arriving at customers’ doors in designer clothing.
“Joking or not, everybody was like, ‘Hey, man, I need a job at UPS,’” said Juan Martinez, a UPS driver in Southern California.
Under the new contract, Martinez expects to earn $110,000 to $120,000 a year, depending on how much overtime he gets, he said. He said his income allowed him to spend more on his children’s education.
Under the Teamsters’ deal with UPS, the top hourly wage will increase to $49 by the end of the five-year contract. Amazon said in January that the average pay of workers at its delivery contractors was $20.50 in the United States. FedEx declined to provide an average wage rate for its delivery workers.
Despite UPS’ superior pay over the years, the Teamsters have not made many inroads at FedEx or Amazon.
The high turnover of delivery and warehouse workers at Amazon and FedEx — where each part-time position was on average filled and vacated twice last year — makes it difficult to organize them.
Another challenge is that delivery workers at Amazon, and drivers who deliver for FedEx Ground, are employed by contractors. Rosenfeld said trying to organize a few dozen people at each contractor could be time consuming and costly.
Last year, 84 workers at an Amazon contractor near Los Angeles joined the Teamsters. But days earlier, Amazon terminated the contract with the operator, Battle-Tested Strategies, the company said, for failing to follow proper safety procedures, among other things.
The Teamsters asked the National Labor Relations Board to rule that Amazon was a joint employer of the workers and order the company to reinstate the contract. The board has yet to rule.
A favorable ruling would be “a massive deal” and an “inspiration for thousands of other workers across the country,” said Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official.
Johnathon Ervin, the owner of Battle-Tested Strategies, said he believed Amazon had terminated the contract, which led to job losses for all his employees, because of the unionization effort. An Amazon spokesperson, Mary Kate Paradis, disputed that.
Ervin said the minimum pay for his workers under the Amazon contract was $19.75. “If you are asking people to make this a career, you should have better work conditions and pay the drivers more,” said Ervin, a 26-year Air Force veteran.
Amazon didn’t respond directly to that criticism. The company noted that its contractors, which it refers to as delivery service partners, had created 279,000 driving jobs over the last five years.
“Helping DSPs create a good overall working experience is important to us, which is why we’ve invested more than $8 billion in state-of-the-art technology, safety features, rates, programs and services for Amazon DSPs and their drivers,” Paradis said in a statement.
Labor groups have made some gains at Amazon, including organizing workers at a Staten Island warehouse. But Amazon is challenging the election there, and that union has been embroiled in infighting.
At FedEx, there is another potential barrier to unionization.
FedEx was founded as an airline, and employees of its Express business come under the Railway Labor Act, which requires unions to organize nationally, across a whole company, at once. Union officials say it’s easier to hold individual votes at each company location as allowed under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs workers at UPS and automakers.
Even so, some FedEx employees do belong to a union. Nearly 6,000 pilots at FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The Teamsters are trying to organize the mechanics who work on the company’s planes.
FedEx said its delivery workers had benefited from not being in a union because the company raised wages significantly during the home-delivery boom of 2021 and 2022, when UPS workers’ raises were set by an agreement reached before the pandemic. A FedEx spokesperson noted that the company incurred an additional $1.4 billion in labor costs in its 2022 fiscal year.

The Phone That Tore Us Apart as Harmony Failed: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Our long-distance marriage was hard to sustain -- and hard to end.
What tore us apart was displayed on a table in the courtroom -- a phone. As the judge stated for the record, I was appearing for my divorce "telephonically."
This was 17 years ago, pre-Zoom. From my home in Oakland, Calif., 2,000 miles from the Midwestern courtroom where my husband sat, I pressed the receiver to my ear and heard coughs and murmurs, chairs scraping and doors closing. The judge asked my husband for the date of our marriage. He couldn't answer.
"Why is it always the man who forgets?" asked the judge.
Someone laughed. (I pictured a bailiff acting like the sidekick on "Judge Judy.")
"July 19, 1998," my husband finally said.
We had started dating eight years before that day, as young musicians in a Miami training orchestra. Everybody there had the same goal: to win a position in a permanent orchestra and make music for a living.
More than a job, music was our identity. Auditions are brutal. There are few openings, and it's not uncommon for 100 players to try out for each. My husband and I faced this likelihood: If we got lucky and won jobs, they would probably be in different cities.
After four years in the orchestra, I won a percussion job with the San Francisco Opera. Some years later, after freelancing in New York, my husband joined an orchestra in the Midwest. Most couples in our situation would break up, but neither of us was willing to choose between job and relationship. So, for six months of every year -- the length of my opera season -- we committed to a long-distance relationship and eventually a long-distance marriage.
Now that marriage was coming to an end. I tried to picture my husband in the courtroom. It was late October. He would be wearing a light winter jacket, his dark blue one. Was he crying? I doubted it. Unlike me, he had an audience. When musicians are onstage, we hide our feelings. If we play well, we smile and bow. If we play badly, we smile and bow. We have learned to show only the good side.
"You have no minor children?" asked the judge.
"No," he said.
After Sunday matinees during my season, I often would take BART to the airport and fly east on an overnight flight that was half empty. I learned to book a seat in the back, hoping to lie down. I drank coffee and stumbled through O'Hare, looking for my connecting regional flight.
After 24 hours together, I would leave on Tuesday morning, arriving back in San Francisco in time for rehearsal. On one visit we spent a whole week together -- I happened to be with him on 9/11, and it took me five days to get a flight back.
Over the years we established a rhythm. Adding children to the composition didn't seem possible.
But I was fine with that because we had so much. To fall in love with my husband's playing was to fall deeply in love with him. I loved his dedication to his art, how all his emotions came through the music. I loved his devotion to his parents and to our ancient kitty, Blackie, about whom he wrote a beautiful eulogy. We were two musicians in tune with each other -- we never had to explain performance anxiety or justify the need to practice. He and I loved being together, even if it just meant practicing in the same house.
As the years became a decade and then longer than a decade, "being together" was exactly what we lacked. For half of every year since we left Miami, we had words but not touch; we shared references but not experiences. When his mother had a breakdown and entered the hospital, I was thousands of miles away, as I also was when he and a flute player were victims of an attempted armed robbery as they loaded the car before an early morning gig. He missed my opening night opera the first year, and every year after.
Musicians must be comfortable with solitude -- we spend hours by ourselves in practice rooms. But solitude in our personal lives was harder to bear.
In San Francisco I never came home to an empty house. Shortly after moving there, I agreed to house-sit for friends and never left. They became my West Coast family. I was surrounded by the chaos and companionship of three children and two adults. Over the years, I hadn't seen the isolation building for my husband, the toll taken from years of leaving me at the airport, where each pickup was just a prelude to a drop-off.
Being lonely within a marriage is the worst kind of loneliness. Even for two musicians, sound wasn't enough. Eventually, the distance just became too much.
Now, back in the courtroom, there was silence. I pictured the judge running down a list, checking boxes. He stated that neither of us was seeking spousal support, that each of us had health insurance. He confirmed that we had divided our assets.
Getting divorced involved a slow-motion unraveling of what we had built. His grandmother's wedding ring went into my fire safe -- I couldn't envision the logistics of sending it back without crying. Our joint bank account was divided in two. (On the phone to the bank representative I couldn't even say the word; I said we were "separating.")
In front of my West Coast house, a FedEx driver unloaded my percussion instruments: snare drums, cymbals, marimba and vibraphone. My ex-husband took custody of all the clarinet music I'd once adored -- I stopped going to Peet's Coffee because Mozart's Clarinet Concerto was on their playlist, and I couldn't bear to hear it.
We had only one major asset to divide. Outside a UPS store on Shattuck Avenue, I broke down crying after quitting claim to our home. Five years earlier we had purchased our dream house. The notary's signature dissolved the dream.
Only 30 minutes had passed since I'd phoned in for my divorce. Our marriage ended at 7 a.m. Pacific Time. My ex left the courtroom, went to the parking garage and called me. Across the miles, we cried together.
I was gutted. He and I had spent summers in Santa Fe, and after our divorce I dreamed of the region's arroyos -- hollows where something had been but no longer was. My house, with its five occupants, was too full of life -- I took to driving the streets of Oakland. Alone in my car, I howled.
Night after night I went to work in the pit, a place where opera's most common theme -- love gone wrong -- constantly unfolded onstage. Leonora chooses poison over a forced marriage. Madama Butterfly chooses seppuku over spousal humiliation. Senta throws herself into the sea as her Flying Dutchman departs.
The stories didn't help, but the music did.
One of the operas in our rotation was "Der Rosenkavalier." Near the end of the opera, the Marschallin and the two young lovers come together to sing about aging, love and loss. Their voices weave together and overlap; the inner lines, struggling to be heard, break through and cross one another. Their bodies resonate together.
In the trio's final moments -- when their voices are soaring, each stretching to reach higher than the others' -- there is so much resistance and conflict between them that we ache for resolution. When the music finally resolves, so do the relationships, and the older woman, with quiet dignity, steps aside.
Over time, grief, like music, modulates. A divorced couple is lucky if each person finds a separate peace. Harmony, though, requires two voices.
In the early years after our divorce, my ex and I still talked every day. We couldn't let go of that connection. It was a habit, a comfort; we needed each other's voice. During the opera's intermissions, I would climb the stairs from the basement to find a private place to call him, leaving the sounds of the opera behind. Cellphone to my ear, my ex and I would discuss music, maestros, colleagues.
A few years later, we talked about Al and Tipper Gore, who had just announced their separation. "It's sad," I said. "They were married 40 years. But I guess it's sadder to stay married and be unhappy."
"It's overrated," my ex said.
"What is?" I asked. "Marriage or divorce?"
"Happiness," he said.
Across the miles we laughed, together.
As a married couple, our voices hadn't been enough. For two people reeling after a divorce, however, the phone had become a lifeline, a gentle landing as we eased our way into our new, separate lives.

They Got a Pet Octopus, And 50 Tiny Surprises: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dr. Cameron Clifford, a dentist in Edmond, Okla., said his son Cal, 9, has been infatuated with octopuses since he was 3 years old. "Every birthday, every Christmas, every holiday, he would always say: 'All I want is an octopus,"' Dr. Clifford said.
For a while, the family nurtured Cal's interest by buying him octopus toys and octopus T-shirts, dressing him as an octopus for Halloween and taking him to aquariums to see live octopuses.
Then, last October, Dr. Clifford sprang for the real deal.
He ordered his son a California two-spot octopus to keep as a pet in a tank in his bedroom. It arrived via UPS in a bag of water packed inside a cardboard box on Oct. 11, Cal's ninth birthday. Cal named it Terrance.
Unbeknown to the family, Terrance was a female, who released what Dr. Clifford described as "a chandelier" of puffy little eggs in December. He assumed the eggs were unfertilized until one night in February, when, while cleaning the tank, he picked one up and examined it closely.
"I accidentally popped it, and this droplet comes out and spreads out these tiny tentacles and does three swim strokes across my viewpoint," he said. "It was absolutely shocking."
Over the next week or so, 49 more hatchlings emerged from their eggs, setting off a rush by the family to keep the tiny octopuses alive and find them homes. Dr. Clifford has been documenting the experience on TikTok, where some of his videos have received more than two million views. Viewers have responded with crying and heart emojis.
"It's expensive, wet chaos," said Dr. Clifford, 36, who has spent thousands of dollars on tanks, water filters, water chillers, crabs, snails and clams in an expanding cephalopod aquarium that briefly took over part of a bathroom in the family home. Among other challenges, he has had to contend with a small electrical fire and about 10 gallons of saltwater that spilled on the carpet of his son's bedroom.
"It's a lot of work," he said. "A lot of work and emotion and money and time."
It is also rewarding, he said. The family loves to pet Terrance, Dr. Clifford said, and makes her "puzzles" by putting a crab in a clear container for her to pull out and eat. Terrance is "one social cephalopod," as one TikTok calls her, showing her extending a tentacle over the top of the tank as if to say hello.
Many scientists discourage people from keeping octopuses as pets, noting that most require live food, carefully calibrated aquatic conditions and frequent stimulation. They also try to escape from their tanks and generally live for less than two years.
Paul Clarkson, director of husbandry operations at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, Calif., said that when he first heard about the Clifford family, he thought they had "no business caring for an octopus."
But after watching Dr. Clifford's TikTok videos, he was "pleasantly surprised."
"It's a delightful story and it seems like they have done a pretty remarkable job as home aquarium keepers, caring for that animal," Mr. Clarkson said. "They obviously went to great lengths and expense."
Still, he cautioned that most pet owners are not equipped to care for an octopus.
"They don't make good pets and, as that family documents in their story, the effort, the time, the money involved in caring for that animal is tremendous and is, at times, kind of a 24/7 job," Mr. Clarkson said. "My recommendation is: Don't try this at home."
Jordan Baker, senior aquarist at the New England Aquarium in Boston, said the California two-spot octopus, known as a bimac, can lay up to 800 eggs, "so this family lucked out by having 50 or so by the end of their experience."
"Managing water quality, husbandry and a short life span for sensitive animals like octopuses can turn into a full-time job, especially with hatchlings involved," she said. "It can be done, but for an average octopus enthusiast, the cost involved in both dollars and labor would be high."
Dr. Clifford said that he ordered Terrance through a broker he found through the Octopus News Magazine Online, which calls itself "an online community and news resource for anything and everything pertaining to octopuses, squids and cephalopods." He said he was told the octopus came from a diver with a fishing license in California, which permits people to catch octopuses in areas that are not state marine reserves.
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife website calls California two-spot octopuses "welcome aquarium pets" and says they are among the most common species used to study octopus genomics, development and evolution.
But some object to keeping octopuses as pets, and Dr. Clifford said he had faced some backlash on social media. Octopuses have attracted widespread attention for their intelligence since the film "My Octopus Teacher," about a South African naturalist's daily interactions with a small octopus, won the Academy Award for best documentary feature in 2021.
"Octopuses are wild creatures whose habitat is the ocean and coastal marine waters," said Barbara J. King, a professor emerita of anthropology at William & Mary, who has written about octopuses. "There, they live in dens, may use tools as they go about daily life and, in some places, express complex social behaviors. They don't belong in human homes, full stop."
Dr. Clifford said he has managed to keep about 24 of the octopus hatchlings alive, with the help of a friend who is keeping them at a property he owns. Even in the wild, scientists say, very few hatchlings survive.
Dr. Clifford said he had hired an intern to reach out to aquariums and research institutions to ask if any were willing to take the hatchlings. At least two have expressed interest, he said.
"I don't know that we've been fully prepared for any of these challenges, but the hope is to re-home as many as we can," he said. "And those that we can't, we will figure out a way to keep them alive and be responsible. It's not a real concrete plan, but we're doing pretty good so far."

Trump Says Abortion Will Be Left to the States. Don't Believe Him.: [Op-Ed]

Author: Goldberg, Michelle

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Donald Trump was asked about the recent Florida Supreme Court decision upholding his adopted state's abortion ban, he promised that he would announce where he stands this week -- a sign of how tricky the politics of reproductive rights have become for the man who did more than any other to roll them back. Sure enough, on Monday he unveiled his latest position in a video statement that attempted to thread the needle between his anti-abortion base and the majority of Americans who want abortion to be legal.
Trump's address was, naturally, full of lies, including the absurd claim that "all legal scholars, both sides," wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the obscene calumny that Democrats support "execution after birth." But the most misleading part of his spiel was the way he implied that in a second Trump administration, abortion law would be left entirely up to the states. "The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land, in this case the law of the state," said Trump.
Trump probably won't be able to dodge the substance of abortion policy for the entirety of a presidential campaign; eventually, he's going to have to say whether he'd sign a federal abortion ban if it crossed his desk and what he thinks of the sweeping abortion prohibitions in many Republican states. But let's leave that aside for the moment, because when it comes to a second Trump administration, the most salient questions are about personnel, not legislation.
Before Monday, Trump reportedly considered endorsing a 16-week national abortion ban, but the fact that he didn't should be of little comfort to voters who want to protect what's left of abortion rights in America. Should Trump return to power, he plans to surround himself with die-hard MAGA activists, not the establishment types he blames for undermining him during his first term. And many of these activists have plans to restrict abortion nationally without passing any new laws at all.
A key to these plans is the Comstock Act, the 19th-century anti-vice law named for the crusading bluenose Anthony Comstock, who persecuted Margaret Sanger, arrested thousands and boasted of driving 15 of his targets to suicide. Passed in 1873, the Comstock Act prohibited the mailing of every "obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article," including "every article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine or thing" intended for "producing abortion." Until quite recently, the Comstock Act was thought to be moot, made irrelevant by a series of Supreme Court decisions on the First Amendment, contraception and abortion. But it was never repealed, and now that Trump's justices have scrapped Roe, his allies believe they can use Comstock to go after abortion nationwide.
"We don't need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books," Jonathan F. Mitchell, a former solicitor general of Texas and the legal mind behind the state's abortion bounty law, told The New York Times in February. He is very much a MAGA insider; he represented Trump in the Supreme Court case arising from Colorado's attempt to boot the ex-president off the ballot as an insurrectionist. As The Times has reported, Mitchell is on a list of lawyers vetted by America First Legal, a nonprofit led by the Trump consigliere Stephen Miller, as having the "spine" to serve in a second Trump administration.
Mitchell is far from the only Trumpist dreaming of bringing Comstock back from the dead. The 2025 Presidential Transition Project, a coalition of major right-wing think tanks, has published a 920-page plan for a new Trump administration, "Mandate for Leadership." In it, Gene Hamilton, America First Legal's vice president and a former Trump Department of Justice official, lays out an agenda for the department to target abortion medication.
"Following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs, there is now no federal prohibition on the enforcement of this statute," he wrote of Comstock. "The Department of Justice in the next conservative administration should therefore announce its intent to enforce federal law against providers and distributors of such pills." ("Mandate for Leadership" also says that a Trump Food and Drug Administration should repeal approval for medication abortion.)
A resurrected Comstock Act wouldn't just stop women from ordering abortion pills through the mail. It could also prevent doctors and pharmacies from dispensing them, since neither the Postal Service nor express carriers like UPS and FedEx would be allowed to ship them in the first place. And it would give the Justice Department a rationale for cracking down on the networks that help provide pills to women in states with abortion bans.
Some interpretations of the Comstock Act might curtail surgical abortion as well, since supplies used to perform them travel through the mail. Abortions could remain legal in some states but become nearly impossible to obtain.
Some anti-abortion leaders, knowing that their schemes are unpopular, don't want Trump to talk about them before he's in office. Speaking of Comstock, a movement attorney told The Atlantic's Elaine Godfrey: "It's obviously a political loser, so just keep your mouth shut. Say you oppose a federal ban, and see if that works."
That is clearly what Trump is trying to do. Whether it works is up to all of us.

P.M.I. Reading Above 50 For Manufacturing Sector
Manufacturing grew in the United States for the first time in one and a half years in March as production rebounded sharply and new orders increased, but employment at factories remained subdued amid "sizable layoff activity" and increased prices.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday suggested that the sector, which has been battered by higher interest rates, was on the mend, though risks remain from rising raw material prices.
While the manufacturing rebound is a boost for the economy's growth prospects, the rise in raw material prices suggested goods inflation could pick up in the months ahead. Goods deflation was the key driver of an inflation slowdown last year.
The institute said its manufacturing P.M.I. increased to 50.3 last month, the highest and first reading above 50 since September 2022, from 47.8 in February. Reuters
POSTAL SERVICE
UPS to Be Main Provider Of Air Cargo for USPS
UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for the United States Postal Service. The Atlanta shipping company said Monday that it had received an air cargo contract from the U.S. Postal Service that significantly expands an existing partnership.
UPS will move the majority of air cargo in the U.S. for the postal service following a transition period, according to UPS.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
USPS's current air cargo contract with FedEx Corp. is set to expire in late September. The agency said in a statement that its contract with UPS will be for a minimum of five and a half years.
FedEx said in a regulatory filing that it wasn't able to reach an agreement on mutually beneficial terms to extend its contract with USPS. The company said that negotiations ended on Friday, after extensive talks. Associated Press
AIR TRAVEL
With Shortage, United Asks Pilots to Take Time
United Airlines is asking its pilots to take time off in May because of delays in receiving new planes that the airline ordered from Boeing, which is struggling with production. A United spokesperson said Monday that the offer is voluntary. In a note to pilots obtained by The Associated Press, United said it expects to make similar requests during the summer and possibly into the fall.
The Air Line Pilots Association said United is offering short-term leaves and unpaid time off, but they are not mandatory.
Boeing declined to comment.
United doesn't expect to get all the Boeing jetliners it ordered and was due to receive this year or next year. A month ago, United said it was contractually due 191 planes this year and 127 next year but expects to receive only 88 this year and 64 in 2025.
Almost all of the shortfall consists of Boeing 737 Max planes, including a new, larger model. Associated Press

She Spent Her Birthday at an Airbnb, and Never Left: [Society Desk]

Full text: As Angie Lucas floated on a raft in the pool at Dennis Weisse's home, she recalled thinking, "I wish I could live here." Her wish came true.
Angela Sue Lucas booked a two-day getaway for her 40th birthday in July 2020 at Club DLuxx, an Airbnb run by Dennis Peter Weisse in North Fort Myers, Fla. Or, so she thought.
"I refused her reservation," said Mr. Weisse, 70, who was nicknamed DLuxx by a high school buddy. "I don't allow guests to throw parties at my home," he told her on the Airbnb app suspecting that was what she was up to. "I have other guests staying at Club DLuxx and it wouldn't be fair." The house is Mr. Weisse's home, out of which he rents two rooms.
The next day, Ms. Lucas, 43, who goes by Angie, set him straight.
"I was excited about my birthday staycation," replied Ms. Lucas, who was looking for a quiet solo escape in early pandemic times. She was thrilled that it featured a pool and was only 20 minutes from Lehigh Acres, Fla., where she was then living.
"I am very quiet and would not wish to cause harm or annoyance," she said, adding that she accepted his decision, and wished him "a happy summer."
Her note, along with her photo on the app, catapulted him into sending an apology 11 minutes later.
"OMG, I'm so sorry," he said, explaining that a previous party thrower racked up $ 900 in damages. "I will welcome you with open arms," he wrote. "Your host, I hope, Dennis."
A few more exchanges went nowhere: "I was really nervous about doing anything wrong," she said. So he called her.
"I talked her into staying," said Mr. Weisse, who promised her a special birthday breakfast: "My signature Denver omelet on steroids."
Ms. Lucas found the key under the mat when she arrived at Club DLuxx on July 8, the afternoon before her birthday. Mr. Weisse would be returning home from visiting his 33-year-old son in Colorado later that day. (His other son died in 2017.)
His friends, who had minded the Airbnb in his absence, not only left the key for her, but also decorated the kitchen to his specifications: balloons, streamers, flowers, tequila and a birthday card. "It was pretty amazing," she said.
She quickly changed into her bathing suit, and headed to the pool. "I wish I could live here," she recalled thinking as she floated on a raft in the L-shaped pool with a floating bar. "It was such a nice respite from my everyday life."
Until the pandemic hit, Ms. Lucas, originally from Westfield, Pa., had worked as a nanny in Florida. She had moved to Tampa with her father when she was 13 and attended Edison State College, now Florida SouthWestern State College, in Fort Myers.
Mr. Weisse got home around 10 p.m. and welcomed her. They chatted about 20 minutes over Corona beers before turning in. The next morning, as promised, he served her a birthday breakfast, along with mimosas, in the lanai by the pool. They then swam the day away.

"She knew every song I knew," said Mr. Weisse, who grew up in Aurora, Ill., and graduated with a bachelor's degree in physical education from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. He retired as a UPS driver in Laguna Hills, Calif.
"Her playlist was my playlist," Mr. Weisse said. "Snoop Dogg songs. Dr. Dre. All damn day we were singing."
That afternoon they had a first kiss, followed by a candlelit dinner later, with Veuve Clicquot, in the lanai.
"I didn't notice an age difference," she said. "We had a lot of things in common."
Mr. Weisse described their second day together as a carbon copy of the first, even better. "We were having a ball, laughing and carrying on like a couple of school kids."
As her departure approached, he invited her to stay longer, indefinitely. She did.
"We spent every single day together," said Ms. Lucas, who soon began helping him around the Airbnb. She now also works as a server at Pizza Connection, an Italian restaurant, in North Fort Myers.
On July 18, they had their first official date -- outdoor drinks at Anthony's on the BLVD, an Italian seafood restaurant now closed in Cape Coral, Fla. "I found my friend," he said. "We never stopped laughing."
Mr. Weisse, whose previous two marriages ended in divorce, told Ms. Lucas from the get-go that he would not get married again. In September, about a week after she moved her stuff into the Airbnb, he changed his tune.
"If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it," he said, quoting Beyoncé.
On Sept. 11, 2020, two months and three days after they met, he got down on one knee and presented her with a diamond engagement ring, around sunset in front of Chapel by the Sea on Captiva Island.
"I have a bad knee," he said with a laugh. "I sucked it up for Angie."
They postponed their original January 2021 wedding date after Ms. Lucas's mother died, and Mr. Weisse had an emergency knee replacement.
"Life gets in the way sometimes," said Ms. Lucas, adding Mr. Weisse has met many friends and family and, despite the age difference, "everyone's OK with it."
"He's a lovable guy," she said.
On Feb. 14, Patricia Slater, a Florida notary public, officiated on a secluded beach on Sanibel Island, Fla., before the two of them, and a photographer.
"If she were 60 it wouldn't matter," Mr. Weisse said. "If she were 30 it wouldn't matter. She's Angie."

Embryo Ruling Shows Our Slide Toward Theocracy: [Op-Ed]

Author: Blow, Charles M

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If you don't think this country is sliding toward theocracy, you're not paying attention.
The drumbeat of incidents moving us ever closer to the seemingly inescapable future is so steady and frequent that we've developed outrage fatigue -- we've grown numb.
For instance, on Tuesday, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are children, and that destruction of those embryos, even by accident, is subject to the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. In his concurring opinion, the chief justice of the court, Tom Parker, wrote, "Even before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory."
The ruling could mean less access to reproductive care in Alabama if specialists in the field of in vitro fertilization simply choose to practice in states that don't threaten their efforts.
There have been cases before in which embryos were destroyed as a result of negligence, but the Alabama decision significantly ups the ante. It essentially turns cryopreservation tanks into frozen nurseries.
The idea is absurd and unscientific. It is instead tied to a religious crusade to downgrade the personhood of women by conferring personhood on frozen embryos.
I called Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, who told me: "One of the points in the abortion debate is, 'Is it really about abortion or is it about controlling women and controlling sex?' And this clearly exposes the idea that it's not just about abortion." He said, "There is no more pro-life medical treatment available, ever, than in vitro fertilization, and this decision clearly threatens the ability for that to continue."
Control of women's bodies is the endgame. And some religious conservatives won't stop until that goal is achieved. For that reason, intervening victories -- like the overturning of Roe v. Wade -- will never be seen as enough; they will only intensify a blinding sense of righteousness.
There is an array of reproductive rights cases percolating around the country that could make their way to the Supreme Court -- the same court that Donald Trump brags about transforming, having appointed a third of its justices. The legal and political battles over these issues are far from over, and the preservation of women's remaining rights is far from certain.
The only thing that seems to be temporarily stopping congressional Republicans from pushing for a national abortion ban -- after years of arguing that their goal was merely to allow individual states to make their own laws -- is that the issue of reproductive choice is an electoral loser for their party.
But now Trump is reportedly talking privately about supporting a national 16-week abortion ban, with some exceptions.
This is what many of his supporters want, and many of them believe he has been singularly chosen by God to advance their theocratic aims. It's one of the reasons that they overlook Trump's glaring flaws and the fact that Trump himself is not a particularly religious man.
It's worth noting that many of the right's efforts, including on the issue of abortion, are led by men who want births but can't give birth, reflecting an imbalance between power and expectation that may carry over to a younger generation. A fascinating new report from Pew Research found that although men and women 18 to 34 "are about equally likely to say they want to get married," 57 percent of young men say they want children one day, compared to just 45 percent of young women.
Abortion is just one front on which this religious fight is being waged. As of last week, the A.C.L.U. was tracking 437 anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bills being considered by state legislatures.
Then there's the alarming effort by conservative groups to transform and reshape the federal government in ways that curtail American freedoms, but also, according to Politico, to bring Christian nationalist ideas into a second Trump administration.
To those advancing these ideas, the will of God counts more than the will of the American people, even when Americans object or disagree.
Reportedly, one idea among the various proposals is invoking the Insurrection Act on Trump's first day back in office to facilitate deployment of the military against protesters.
We are perilously close to all this becoming a reality, potentially aided and abetted by disaffected Democratic voters.
I'm talking about many Democrats with single-issue objections to President Biden -- whether it's opposition to his position on the Israel-Hamas war, disappointments about the overall state of the economy or concerns about the president's age -- who haven't committed to supporting his re-election, who don't seem to see that in November the country faces one of the most existential electoral decisions it ever has faced.
If these Democrats decide to punish Biden by sitting it out, they could wind up performing one of the greatest acts of self-immolation in recent political history: abandoning an administration committed to the protection of democracy and possibly allowing the ascension of a theocracy intent on destroying the very freedoms that progressives cherish.

With Package Volumes Falling, UPS Plans to Cut 12,000 Jobs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After what the company called a "difficult and disappointing" 2023, UPS said the cuts would save $ 1 billion this year.
United Parcel Service plans to cut about 12,000 jobs this year as the company tries to slash costs in the face of falling package volumes and higher wages linked to a union contract it signed in the summer.
Carol Tomé, the chief executive of UPS, told analysts on an earnings call Tuesday that it had been a "difficult and disappointing year." Revenue fell more than 9 percent last year, and profit dropped by a third.
Ms. Tomé said most of the job cuts would be made in the first half of the year, reducing expenses by about $ 1 billion. UPS employs nearly 500,000 people.
UPS narrowly averted a strike in the summer when the union that represents more than 300,000 of its workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, threatened to walk off the job if a labor agreement that included higher wages wasn't reached. A contract settlement was reached shortly after the previous agreement expired, but the uncertainty about a potential walkout hurt the company's package volumes. UPS said about 60 percent of the volume it lost during the standoff had returned by the end of December.
The positions that would be eliminated this year are not union jobs, according to the Teamsters. The layoffs will instead affect managerial staff, "throughout the world and in all functions," a statement by UPS said. The moves reflect a "change in the way we work," Ms. Tomé said, and even if business rebounds, those jobs may not come back. Employees will also be expected to work from the office five days a week, she added.
UPS said it had recorded a 12 percent increase in wages for unionized workers in the fourth quarter as a result of the new contract. To reduce the hit to profits, the company said, it reduced workers' hours by about 10 percent last quarter.
UPS shares fell more than 7 percent on Tuesday.
The company said it expected package volumes to continue falling in the first half of this year, then increase in the second half. The company's weak demand forecast and job cuts stand in contrast to recent economic indicators showing resilient global growth and signs of an economic "soft landing," defying predictions of a deeper downturn.
Still, the number of workers being laid off across the United States ticked up slightly in December, according to Labor Department data released on Tuesday. And several tech and media companies have announced large layoffs in recent months.
While the rate of overall layoffs is low compared with prepandemic levels -- and an unexpected rise in job openings last month suggested that hiring remained busy -- certain industries are feeling a pinch more than others.
"If you're in those industries, it probably feels pretty uncomfortable right now," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.

Wall Street Is Mixed, Lingering Near Record Highs: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-is-mixed-lingering-near-record-highs/docview/2919993351/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks drifted through a quiet Tuesday and held near their record highs after a mixed set of profit reports.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent from its record. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.8 percent.
UPS slumped 8.2 percent even though it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of Wall Street's estimates, and it also gave a forecast for full-year revenue in 2024 that was weaker than expected.
Whirlpool sank 6.6 percent despite likewise reporting a better profit than expected. Its forecast for 2024 revenue of $ 16.9 billion was roughly $ 1 billion below analysts' estimates.
Helping to offset those losses was General Motors. The automaker jumped 7.8 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected.
Treasury yields were also mixed after reports that showed the economy remained stronger than expected. One said confidence among consumers was climbing, while another suggested the job market may be warmer than forecast.
Employers advertised nine million job openings at the end of December, slightly more than economists expected and slightly above November's level. Traders were expecting a cool-down in the number of openings.
A drawdown would have fit more neatly into the narrative that has carried Wall Street to a record: a slowdown in the economy's growth strong enough to keep a lid on inflation but not enough to create a recession.
Hopes for that trend are what have Wall Street bubbling about the possibility of several cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve this year. Cuts would mark a sharp turnaround from the Fed's dramatic increases to rates over the last two years, and the reductions would give a boost to the economy and investment prices.
The Federal Reserve began its latest policy meeting on interest rates on Tuesday, but virtually no one expects it to cut rates this soon. That won't stop economists and traders from parsing every word coming out of the Fed Wednesday after its meeting finishes. They'll be searching for clues that a rate cut may arrive at its next meeting in March.
"We think markets are overly optimistic that we'll see a Fed interest rate cut in March," said Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard. "It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates."
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves closely with expectations for the Fed's action, rose to 4.36 percent from 4.32 percent late Monday. It moved decisively higher following the release of the economic reports.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is the centerpiece of the bond market, fell to 4.05 percent from 4.09 percent late Monday.
After trading ended on Tuesday, a pair of Wall Street's most influential stocks also reported their latest quarterly results.
As two of the largest stocks in the market by value, Microsoft and Alphabet have outsize sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes. They, along with five other Big Tech stocks, have accounted for the majority of the S&P 500's torrid rally since hitting a bottom two Octobers ago.
Three more of the "Magnificent Seven" big tech stocks will report their results on Thursday: Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms. They'll also need to hit expectations to justify their massive leaps.
Companies that have reported better profits than expected so far this reporting season have not been getting as big a pop as usual, analysts say.
JetBlue Airways sank 4.7 percent despite reporting a milder loss for the last three months of 2023 than analysts expected. It said it expected revenue to be roughly flat in 2024.

Full text: The killing of Jam Master Jay, the Run-DMC D.J., sent shock waves through hip-hop. On Monday, two men will stand trial on charges of murdering him.
More than 20 years after the hip-hop D.J. Jam Master Jay was gunned down in his Queens recording studio, two men charged in the killing will face a federal jury in Brooklyn in a trial set to start Monday.
Jam Master Jay, whose real name was Jason Mizell, of the seminal group Run-DMC, was 37 when he died in a crime that remained unresolved for nearly two decades. The two defendants, Karl Jordan Jr., 40, and Ronald Washington, 59, were charged in 2020, when federal prosecutors accused them of plotting to kill Mr. Mizell after he cut Mr. Washington out of a drug deal. A third man, Jay Bryant, who was also charged in connection with the murder last year, will be tried separately.
Prosecutors said that the defendants burst into the studio with guns on the evening of Oct. 30, 2002. Mr. Jordan then approached Mr. Mizell, firing two shots at him at close range, they say. One of the bullets struck Mr. Mizell in the head; another man was wounded in the leg. Four other people were in the studio at the time, but none identified the killers immediately after the shooting.
The jury in the trial of Mr. Washington and Mr. Jordan will be anonymous: Their names will not be revealed to the defendants or their lawyers. In court papers filed this month, prosecutors said the defendants and "those acting on their behalf" had already tried to intimidate witnesses in the case.
Mr. Washington, also known as Tinard, has already served significant jail time for crimes including heroin distribution and armed robbery. Mr. Jordan, known as Little D, who was 18 when Mr. Mizell was killed, had no adult criminal record when he was arrested in 2020, though prosecutors said in a filing that he had been in the drug trade for years before then. The 2020 indictment included several additional narcotics distribution counts against Mr. Jordan.
The defendants and Mr. Mizell grew up in Hollis, Queens -- a neighborhood that produced some of the biggest names in early hip-hop.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Mizell had been involved in transporting large quantities of cocaine to sell in the New York area for about six years when he was killed. Three months before the shooting, he had acquired 10 kilograms of cocaine on consignment from a dealer in the Midwest, according to court papers. The government said that Mr. Jordan, Mr. Washington and other co-conspirators were going to distribute the drugs.
But after a dispute between Mr. Washington and one of the co-conspirators, Mr. Mizell sought to cut him out of the transaction. That spurred Mr. Washington to conspire with Mr. Jordan to murder Mr. Mizell, prosecutors said.
The charges carry a minimum sentence of 20 years -- and a maximum of life in prison. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland directed prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York, where the trial is being held, not to seek the death penalty.
The sudden death of a figure who had been known for upbeat hip-hop music -- far from the gangsta rap that came to dominate the genre in later years -- sent shock waves through the rap world that continue to this day. The case has been chronicled in several documentaries, articles and books.
Run-DMC, whose members along with Mr. Mizell included Joseph Simmons, known as Run, and Darryl McDaniels, known as DMC, brought hip-hop to the mainstream in the mid-1980s. They were the first rappers featured prominently on MTV, sold millions of records and signed an early deal with Adidas, whose sneakers Mr. Mizell made part of the group's look.
"You could say he was like the Ringo Starr of hip-hop D.J.s, because Run-DMC were like the Beatles of hip-hop," said Bill Adler, a former head of publicity for Def Jam, the record company co-founded by Mr. Simmons's brother Russell.
Mr. Adler added that Mr. Mizell had a strong influence on the group's signature street style, which included brimmed Stetson hats, Adidas shoes without laces and leather jackets.
Dan Charnas, a hip-hop journalist and professor at New York University, said that hip-hop's heart was cut out when Mr. Mizell died.
"That's the dude who made it possible for this new musical archetype to rise," he said. "A dude who was friendly pretty much to everybody, who represented a more innocent time where there weren't these types of beefs that turned violent like Tupac's and Big's."
A mural of Mr. Mizell is painted on a wall near the corner of 205th Street and Hollis Avenue in Queens, where many residents said they still felt the effects of his music and legacy. The musician Akil Wright, who performs under the name Get Wright DOLO, walked by on Wednesday in Adidas sneakers that Run-DMC inspired him to wear.
"Artists like him created artists like me," said Mr. Wright, 31, a lifelong Hollis resident.
Debra McKnight, 64, remembered all three members of Run-DMC hanging out in her kitchen in the 1970s; they were friends with her son. She said she appreciated that Mr. Mizell had stayed in Hollis.
"He didn't forget where he came from," she said.
Jam Master Jay and his Run-DMC mates were the first celebrities Jubar Jones, 50, ever met, he said. It was the early '80s, and Mr. Jones tagged along with his older brother to a basement party near the Baisley Park Houses in Queens, where he was introduced to the group. Mr. Jones, who works at a UPS warehouse, said the connection between Run-DMC and Hollis gave him and his peers a sense of being special.
"It feels like a part of history," he said.
Mr. Jones cataloged the way Run-DMC changed music, fashion and culture. As for Jam Master Jay, Mr. Jones called him a "trendsetter," a "forefather of hip-hop" and a "pioneer of beats."
"He's a legend around here," Mr. Jones said. "He's like a father figure, a guardian."

Full text: The Biden administration has allowed more than a million people into the United States temporarily under a program that Republicans in Congress want to limit.
Artem Marchuk needed to escape Ukraine or die. He didn't see any other options.
He and his wife and children had been living in Bakhmut, the site of the war's deadliest battle. Even when they made it out of the city, nothing in Ukraine felt safe.
"My kids were very hungry," Artem's wife, Yana, said in an interview from the family's home in Baltimore, where the U.S. government resettled them in 2022. "There was darkness everywhere."
The Marchuks are among more than a million people whom the Biden administration has allowed into the United States over the past three years under an authority called humanitarian parole, which allows people without visas to live and work in the United States temporarily. Parole has been extended to Ukrainians, Afghans and thousands of people south of the U.S.-Mexico border fleeing poverty and war.
Now the program is at the heart of a battle in Congress over legislation that would unlock billions of dollars in military aid for some of President Biden's top foreign policy priorities, such as Ukraine and Israel.
Republicans want to see a severe crackdown on immigration in exchange for their votes to approve the military aid -- and restricting the number of people granted parole is one of their demands.
For Mr. Marchuk, the fact that a program that saved his family has become a bargaining chip on Capitol Hill feels wrong. Although the latest version of the deal would mostly spare Ukrainians seeking parole, he feels a deep sense of solidarity with other people -- regardless of their nationality -- who may be left behind if Congress imposes limits on the program.
Americans, he said, should welcome people like his family. Mr. Marchuk, a former technology executive in Ukraine, said he has found work helping other refugees with the advocacy organization Global Refuge, as well as driving for DoorDash, UPS and Amazon since he arrived in Baltimore.
"Refugees deliver these packages," said Mr. Marchuk, 36. "American citizens who have an education," he said, very often don't want to work as drivers.
What is humanitarian parole?
Humanitarian parole has existed since the 1950s to help vulnerable people fleeing failing states and conflict, but Mr. Biden has used it more than his predecessors, immigration experts say. By law, the United States may grant parole if there are "urgent humanitarian" needs or a "significant public benefit" for doing so.
People who want to enter the country under parole must first have a sponsor in the United States and then undergo vetting by U.S. immigration authorities.
There are important differences between parole and the U.S. refugee program, which is the more typical path for people seeking sanctuary in the United States.
People who have parole status are not put on a pathway to a green card, or permanent residency, as refugees are. Instead, they are allowed to stay only for a limited time, usually about two years, though the administration can extend it.
Once the status expires, people must leave the United States, apply for another immigration program or take the risk of staying in the country illegally.
A political bargaining chip.
The Biden administration has made parole a key part of its immigration policy, using it to help those from Ukraine and Afghanistan, as well as people from Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, whose economies have all but collapsed.
More than 176,000 Ukrainians and 77,000 Afghans have come to the United States under the program. And last year, the Biden administration began granting parole to 30,000 migrants a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who have financial sponsors in the United States. The White House argued that its strategy was designed to discourage migrants from crossing the border illegally by creating a more orderly, legal pathway.
Republicans have sought to limit nearly all of those programs, saying Mr. Biden is taking advantage of an authority that is supposed to be used in only extraordinary circumstances.
"They've abused the hell out of the statute," Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said this month. "I have zero confidence that we would have achieved much if we don't limit the use of parole."
Some Republicans say parole often amounts to a loophole that fuels illegal immigration. They want to crack down on a practice known as "catch and release," in which migrants are briefly detained when they arrive in the United States but are then quickly granted parole and released to await immigration court hearings.
The particulars of the deal in Congress are still being negotiated. A deal that is being discussed in the Senate seeks to reduce parole numbers by tightening immigration enforcement at the southern border.
That would not have a direct impact on the route that many Ukrainians took to America, since they generally do not arrive by the southern border. (Some Ukrainians do make it to the United States that way, however.)
But there is still deep uncertainty about whether the program will survive without changes.
Even some congressional Democrats who oppose substantially changing the parole program have acknowledged they may need to give in to some Republican demands to limit the program if they have any chance of passing the military aid package.
Republicans in the House, including Speaker Mike Johnson, have threatened to block any deal that does not impose a hard cap on the number of migrants who can receive parole, as well as the elimination of group-based parole, like the program for Ukrainians that the Marchuks used to get into the United States.
Keeping close tabs on the negotiations in Congress, Mr. Marchuk said he finds himself being pulled in two directions. He sees the parole program as a lifeline for desperate families. But he desperately wants Congress to provide military aid for Ukraine, too.
He said it might be the only hope for his sister, who is on the front lines in Ukraine, to survive the war.
'They're talking about lives.'
As lawmakers debate the merits of the parole program, some immigrants in the United States say all the political talk glosses over the calamities in their home countries.
"People are dying left and right, being kidnapped and it's just impossible," said Valerie Laveus, who came to America from Haiti nearly 20 years ago and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. "I am concerned because I feel like a lot of times these people are having these conversations and they're forgetting the human factor. They're forgetting that they're talking about lives."
Ms. Laveus said her brother, Reginald Daniel, waited years for a U.S. visa but got caught up in the growing backlog. She knew she had to help him flee, particularly after he began suffering seizures because of brain swelling from a gunshot wound to the head.
When Mr. Biden announced early last year that Haitians would be eligible for parole, Ms. Laveus immediately filed the paperwork to prove she would be able to financially support her brother and his son for two years.
"When my brother came, he was skin and bones," Ms. Laveus said. "If I took a picture of how he looked and I gave you a picture of how he looks now, you would see the striking difference."
Mr. Daniel is now training to work in security, and his son has attended a military academy in Florida. While Ms. Laveus is optimistic for her brother and nephew, she also is "very leery and worried" about what the congressional talks could mean for their opportunity to apply for future immigration status.
Mr. Biden's allies say restricting use of parole would very likely backfire.
"It means that people in desperate circumstances, who need protection, who need to leave, who need to flee their options, will be more limited, which increases the likelihood they choose the dangerous option of coming to the border," said Cecilia Muñoz, one of Mr. Biden's top immigration officials during the transition and co-chair of Welcome.US, an organization that helps Americans sponsor the resettlement of refugees to the United States.

BALTIMORE — Artem Marchuk needed to escape Ukraine or die. He didn’t see any other options.

As Primaries Near, State Legislators Move To Fight Fake A.I. Ads: [National Desk]

Full text: Sophisticated political deepfakes have warped elections overseas. Can U.S. legislators act fast enough to make A.I. campaign ads more transparent?
When experts in artificial intelligence recently showed a gathering of state legislators a deepfake image that had been generated by A.I. in early 2022, depicting former presidents Donald J. Trump and Barack Obama playing one-on-one basketball, the crowd chuckled at how rudimentary it was.
Then the panel brought out a fake video that was made just a year later, and the legislators gasped at how realistic it looked.
Alarmed by the increasing sophistication of what can be false or highly misleading political ads generated by artificial intelligence, state lawmakers are scrambling to draft bills to regulate them.
With primary voters about to cast the first ballots in 2024, the issue has become even more pressing for legislators in dozens of states who are returning to work this month.
"States know that there's going to have to be some regulatory guardrails," said Tim Storey, president and chief executive of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which convened the A.I. panel at a conference in December. "It's almost trying to figure out what's happening in real time."
The broader goal, legislators said, was to prevent what has already happened elsewhere, especially in some elections overseas. In Slovakia, deepfake voice recordings, falsely purporting to be of the leader of a pro-Western political party buying votes, may have contributed to that party's narrow loss to a pro-Kremlin party. And last year, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida released fake A.I. images of former President Donald J. Trump embracing Dr. Anthony Fauci.
At the beginning of 2023, only California and Texas had enacted laws related to the regulation of artificial intelligence in campaign advertising, according to Public Citizen, an advocacy group tracking the bills. Since then, Washington, Minnesota and Michigan have passed laws, with strong bipartisan support, requiring that any ads made with the use of artificial intelligence disclose that fact.
By the first week of January, 11 more states had introduced similar legislation -- including seven since December -- and at least two others were expected soon as well. The penalties vary; some states impose fines on offenders, while some make the first offense a misdemeanor and further offenses a felony.
State Representative Julie Olthoff, a Republican from northwestern Indiana who attended the legislators' conference in Austin, Texas, said her background as the owner of a marketing and advertising business made her realize the potential dangers of people trying to manipulate images and words.
Her bill, filed on Jan. 3, would require any "fabricated media" using A.I. to come with a disclaimer stating, "Media depicting the candidate has been altered or artificially generated." The bill would also allow candidates who were the targets of A.I. ads to pursue civil action.
"People don't know how much to trust a source anymore, so I think this will help," she said.
Several A.I. bills have been introduced in Congress, including one led by Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, and Josh Hawley of Missouri, a Republican. But those bills would apply to federal elections, not state or local ones, said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, which has petitioned the Federal Election Commission to take additional actions against deepfakes.
"It's one thing to rebut a lie or a mischaracterization, but to rebut a convincing video or recording of you saying something, what do you do?" he said. "That's why we're seeing this breadth of interest."
Some legislators have contemplated banning misleading A.I. ads altogether. But political ads generally are given a lot of latitude in what they can say, and to avoid any First Amendment challenges, most lawmakers have focused on requiring that those who make, produce or disseminate the ads disclose -- in legible text or clear audio -- that the deceptive ads were produced by artificial intelligence.
Many of the bills apply only to such ads that are released up to 90 days before an election, when voters are paying the most attention.
Minnesota's new law, enacted in May, targets those who use deepfakes to create sexual content without consent, or to damage a political candidate or influence an election, said State Representative Zack Stephenson, a Democrat who represents the northern Minneapolis suburbs.
In Michigan, which adopted its law in late November, what made the issue come to life was testimony from one of the bill's sponsors, State Representative Penelope Tsernoglou, a Democrat from East Lansing.
Flanked by her co-sponsors, Matthew Bierlein, a Republican from Tuscola County, and Noah Arbit, a Democrat from Oakland County, Ms. Tsernoglou played an uncanny audio recording of President Biden praising the bill.
"No more malarkey," said the voice purporting to be Mr. Biden. "As my dad used to say, 'Joey, you can't believe everything you hear.' Not a joke."
But it was not real. Instead, a friend of Ms. Tsernoglou's with no experience in tech had used an A.I. voice generator, she said in an interview.
"He said it took him five minutes," she added.
The proposals have encountered minimal opposition to date, said Ilana Beller, field manager for Public Citizen's Democracy Campaign. Technology companies have also been generally supportive, while trying to make sure that they are not liable for unwittingly airing an unlabeled deepfake on their platforms.
Of the half-dozen states that have introduced A.I. bills since December, Kentucky stands out because even first-time violators would be subject to a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.
One of the bill's sponsors, State Representative John Hodgson, a Republican from suburban Louisville, said he felt that a fine of several hundred or thousand dollars would not be enough of a deterrent.
Noting that he took his pet sheep Sassy and Bossy to a living Nativity scene during the Christmas holidays, Mr. Hodgson, a retired executive for UPS Airlines, mused: "Imagine if it's three days before the election, and someone says I've been caught in an illicit relationship with a sheep and it's sent out to a million voters. You can't recover from that."

State Legislators, Wary of Deceptive Election Ads, Tighten AI Rules

AUSTIN, Texas — When experts in artificial intelligence recently showed a gathering of state legislators a deepfake image that had been generated by artificial intelligence in early 2022, depicting former presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama playing one-on-one basketball, the crowd chuckled at how rudimentary it was.
Then the panel brought out a fake video that was made just a year later, and the legislators gasped at how realistic it looked.
Alarmed by the increasing sophistication of what can be false or highly misleading political ads generated by artificial intelligence, state lawmakers are scrambling to draft bills to regulate them.
With primary voters about to cast the first ballots in 2024, the issue has become even more pressing for legislators in dozens of states who are returning to work this month.
“States know that there’s going to have to be some regulatory guardrails,” said Tim Storey, president and CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which convened the AI panel at a conference in December. “It’s almost trying to figure out what’s happening in real time.”
The broader goal, legislators said, was to prevent what has already happened elsewhere, especially in some elections overseas. In Slovakia, deepfake voice recordings, falsely purporting to be of the leader of a pro-Western political party buying votes, may have contributed to that party’s narrow loss to a pro-Kremlin party. And last year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis released fake AI images of former President Donald Trump embracing Dr. Anthony Fauci.
At the beginning of 2023, only California and Texas had enacted laws related to the regulation of artificial intelligence in campaign advertising, according to Public Citizen, an advocacy group tracking the bills. Since then, Washington, Minnesota and Michigan have passed laws, with strong bipartisan support, requiring that any ads made with the use of artificial intelligence disclose that fact.
By the first week of January, 11 more states had introduced similar legislation — including seven since December — and at least two others were expected soon as well. The penalties vary; some states impose fines on offenders, while some make the first offense a misdemeanor and further offenses a felony.
State Rep. Julie Olthoff, a Republican from northwestern Indiana who attended the legislators’ conference in Austin, said her background as the owner of a marketing and advertising business made her realize the potential dangers of people trying to manipulate images and words.
Her bill, filed Jan. 3, would require any “fabricated media” using AI to come with a disclaimer stating, “Media depicting the candidate has been altered or artificially generated.” The bill would also allow candidates who were the targets of AI ads to pursue civil action.
“People don’t know how much to trust a source anymore, so I think this will help,” she said.
Several AI bills have been introduced in Congress, including one led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo. But those bills would apply to federal elections, not state or local ones, said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, which has petitioned the Federal Election Commission to take additional actions against deepfakes.
“It’s one thing to rebut a lie or a mischaracterization, but to rebut a convincing video or recording of you saying something, what do you do?” he said. “That’s why we’re seeing this breadth of interest.”
Some legislators have contemplated banning misleading AI ads altogether. But political ads generally are given a lot of latitude in what they can say, and to avoid any First Amendment challenges, most lawmakers have focused on requiring that those who make, produce or disseminate the ads disclose — in legible text or clear audio — that the deceptive ads were produced by artificial intelligence.

Unions’ Backing for Israel Shifts to Protests

“Why are we here?” said Brandon Mancilla, a leader with the United Auto Workers. Mancilla faced a crowd of hundreds of union members gathered on the steps of the New York Public Library’s Fifth Avenue branch, huddling against the cold as they rallied for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.
“Cease-fire now, solidarity forever!” Mancilla, 29, said as the crowd cheered, waving union banners and Palestinian flags. “Let’s get more and more unions behind us.”
On display in that Dec. 21 protest — which came shortly after the 350,000-member UAW voted to support a cease-fire — was a shift in the American labor movement’s relationship with Israel.
For decades, the most prominent American unions were largely supportive of Israel. Today, though, amid a resurgence of the American labor movement, some activists are urging their unions to call for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and succeeding — a change that reflects a broader generational shift. But many unions are divided over what stance to take or whether to take any stance at all.
Some American labor leaders have remained supportive of Israel’s war against Hamas, and moved swiftly to condemn Hamas’ attacks on Oct. 7. They are dismayed by the views of a younger generation of organizers who in some cases oppose Israel’s existence as a Jewish state.
“There has been a shift in society, and that’s reflected in the labor movement as it is every place else,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Jewish Labor Committee and head of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
Longtime Labor Support
The American labor movement’s traditionally close relationship with Israel stems from decades of Jewish labor leaders staunchly backing the state, even before its founding. In 1917, the American Federation of Labor passed a resolution supporting the Balfour Declaration, which called for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine, and throughout the 1920s and ’30s unions donated millions to Histadrut, Israel’s national labor union.
After Israel’s founding in 1948, American unions started investing in the country’s bond program, using money from strike and pension funds. Some also donated money to build stadiums and children’s homes in Israel. By 1994, $1 billion had been invested in those bonds by around 1,700 American trade unions, according to archival research from Jeff Schuhrke, a labor historian at Empire State University, part of the State University of New York.
“In many ways, you can argue that U.S. unions helped construct the state of Israel,” Schuhrke said.
In 1980, the president of the AFL-CIO, Lane Kirkland, declared that a Palestinian state would be “a terrorist state” and “an unmixed disaster to the United States” before hundreds of labor lawyers and union officials. In 1982, the union took out an advertisement in The New York Times declaring support for Israel in its war against Lebanon: “The AFL-CIO is not neutral.”
Union support for Israel sometimes bred internal tensions, with some of the union rank-and-file membership protesting the relationship. In 1949, the same year the International Ladies Garment Workers’ Union made a $1 million Israeli bond purchase, a group of its members asked the union to support Palestinian refugees. In 1973, thousands of Arab American autoworkers in Detroit briefly walked off the job to protest the UAW’s financial support of Israel. In 2002, after John J. Sweeney, then the AFL-CIO president, spoke at the National Rally for Israel, a group of union members circulated a petition condemning his support for the country.
Professional Consequences
Since the Israel-Gaza war broke out, debates over the fighting have exposed deeper rifts over how unions should represent their diverse membership, and how to balance political advocacy with professional ramifications.
The Writers Guild faced an outpouring of frustration from more than 300 members when the union didn’t immediately condemn Hamas’ attacks on Oct. 7. Starbucks and its union, Starbucks Workers United, are suing each other over the union’s use of company imagery in a pro-Palestinian social media post. Chris Smalls, head of the Amazon Labor Union, drew backlash for a pro-Palestinian post that included the phrase “from the river to the sea” — a decades-old Palestinian nationalist slogan that many see as a call for Israel’s annihilation — echoing an outcry The New Yorker’s union faced in 2021 when it posted the phrase on social media.
When a proposed statement calling for a cease-fire circulated in early November at the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, a UAW sub-union of more than 3,000 public defenders and legal workers, a heated internal debate broke out. Those who opposed it said they didn’t understand why the union had to weigh in on the issue, which had little direct connection to their work.
One legal aid lawyer, Isaac Altman, said in an interview that he found the union’s proposed resolution to be one-sided. He said he couldn’t understand why the resolution did not shine a greater spotlight on the violence of Hamas militants. But he was also concerned that the statement would anger the legal establishment in Nassau County, New York, potentially posing harm to the clients he represents.
So he, along with three other legal aid lawyers, sued to stop the union from voting on a cease-fire resolution. A court issued a temporary injunction.
“I felt there was a real concern that judges would look negatively at this resolution and take it out on our clients,” said Altman, 27, who is Jewish.
Altman’s organization, the Legal Aid Society of Nassau County, gets its funding from contracts with the Republican-controlled county. He and his colleagues worried about how the proposed resolution might affect their funding.
“We have a higher duty or obligation to our clients that I think trumps people’s right to speak,” said Ilana Kopmar, another plaintiff in the suit and a legal aid lawyer for 31 years. Kopmar said she was also worried about the impact such a statement could have on Jewish and Israeli clients.
The injunction was dissolved on Dec. 15 by a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York, and a few days later, the cease-fire statement passed, by a vote of 1,067-570.
The president of the Neighborhood Defender Service union, which is also part of the legal aid lawyers’ union, resigned on Nov. 6 over concerns that his organization’s funding would be at risk if it released a statement on the war. The Bronx Defenders, another public defense organization in New York, faced calls to be defunded across the city after its union released a statement in support of Palestinians.
Other union organizers worry about the internal tensions provoked by these debates. NewsGuild-CWA, which is the parent organization of The New York Times’ union and represents more than 26,000 members as part of the Communications Workers of America, heard from some of its members who wanted the union to take a position in favor of a cease-fire. A group of journalists at the Times, concerned this would undermine coverage of the war, then formed an Independence Caucus.
“We want the Guild leadership to avoid public positions that compromise the journalistic independence required of many members and could undermine our work,” said Megan Twohey, a leader in the caucus.
The union, which represents workers outside the media industry too, has not taken a position on the war. It has made statements about journalists killed in the conflict.
Within some newer unions, there’s been a reticence to weigh in on a cease-fire. The Alphabet Workers Union, for example, at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which has about 1,400 members, hasn’t voted on whether to call for a cease-fire, partly because the union is nascent and worried about alienating potential members, particularly tech workers in Israel. The issue has come up for discussion at membership meetings and on the messaging app Discord.
A Generational Shift
Changes in union attitudes toward Israel are coming at a moment of wider revival for the American labor movement. After strikes in Hollywood and at auto plants, public approval of unions stood at 67% last year, up from 54% a decade ago, according to Gallup.
“For a few decades, coinciding with the labor movement’s decline, its vision became much more narrow,” said Mancilla, the UAW leader. “It was on the defensive.”
Now, many activists are eager to see their unions seize on the momentum of this period by taking bold stances on progressive issues, which they see as part of a history of American labor’s involvement in national and international politics. (Labor unions helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which tied demands for fair wages and civil rights.)
“People who have become very engaged in their unions want their unions to be the full expression of their politics,” said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers. “There’s always a risk that can alienate some people, and it is likely to energize others.”
And some union organizers feel that if they’re taking on political fights at home, they should be taking on battles abroad as well.
Peter Lyngso, 30, a part-time package handler at UPS and a Chicago union activist, drew a parallel between younger union members’ push for a new contract and their urge to speak out on the conflict.
“What you’re seeing is this new activist layer saying these are one and the same fight,” he said.
Longtime labor experts say that the demand for pro-cease-fire statements from American unions is evidence of a generational shift. There’s a new wave of leadership from young activists who grew up after the Oslo peace process of the 1990s collapsed.
“This is being generated by social-movement young people, Gen Zs, millennials,” said Seth Goldstein, a labor lawyer who has worked with the Amazon Labor Union. “I don’t think they’re anti-Israel, necessarily. But what they’ve seen in Israel is the Netanyahu government.”
At the same time, some American labor leaders remain adamant about their support for Israel, including Appelbaum of the Jewish Labor Committee.
Randi Weingarten, 66, president of the American Federation of Teachers, is a longtime supporter of Israel. She went to Israel after the war broke out to meet with civil society groups, pay shiva calls and visit the families of hostages.
On Dec. 18, dozens of protesters outside the Museum of the City of New York demanded that Weingarten call for a cease-fire. She has since posted that she supports “a bilateral, negotiated cease-fire” that brings the hostages home, provides aid to Gaza and “starts the process of 2 states for 2 peoples.”
Weingarten said she felt it was important for unions to engage with geopolitical issues, beyond their contract negotiations, even when labor leaders are faced with protest and dissent.
“There will be people within the labor movement that say, ‘Just do the economics, just do collective bargaining,’” she said. “Then there are people within the labor movement that say intersectionality is imperative.”

Small Doses of Local Care: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Some small independent pharmacies in the city are benefiting from a decline in chain stores. But theft and low reimbursement rates are still making life hard.
At one of the few chain pharmacies still open in the South Bronx -- a Rite Aid on Southern Boulevard -- just about everything except for the greeting cards is behind plexiglass barriers and sealed with a lock. The Kit Kats. The Pringles. The soda. The dog toys.
Yet near a subway station on that same bustling shopping street, four mom-and-pop pharmacies are doing brisk business. Their unlocked shelves are filled with merchandise. The pharmacist and technicians are on the phones, answering calls in Spanish and English from patients whose names they often know.
"I'm the kind of person who likes to speak to the patients," said Dr. Rana Makki, supervising pharmacist at Bronx Specialty Pharmacy, a few doors down from the Rite Aid, explaining why she works there instead of a chain. "We know who you are, delivery is faster here and there you have to deal more with people stealing."
The chain pharmacy industry nationwide is in significant turmoil. Some pharmacists are staging walkouts or quitting over poor working conditions and aggressive productivity targets. Online shopping has eaten into business. And anti-shoplifting measures, like the locked cases in the Bronx Rite Aid, are raising costs and making shopping at chain pharmacies less convenient.
Nationally, there are fears of growing pharmacy deserts, defined as areas where a lack of drugstores makes it hard to get a prescription filled.
But in New York City, where the total number of pharmacies actually grew slightly over the past year, there is a robust mom-and-pop pharmacy industry that could possibly pick up the slack. Of the 2,964 pharmacies registered with the state as of November, only about 15 percent were one of the three major chains.
The large number of local pharmacies in New York City makes it an outlier among the nation's urban areas. According to a 2021 study, less than 1 percent of residents live in a pharmacy desert in New York City, compared with 13 percent in Los Angeles, 20 percent in Chicago and 29 percent in Houston.
As in most of the country, the number of chain pharmacies in New York City has declined significantly since the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, there were 606 of the three major chain pharmacies -- CVS, Duane Reade/Walgreens and Rite Aid -- in the city's five boroughs. By December 2023, there were 435, according to a new report by the Center for an Urban Future, a New York nonprofit that counts the number of chain stores annually.
Duane Reade/Walgreens has led the closings, shedding some 106 New York City stores since the pandemic began. But it was Rite Aid, which recently declared bankruptcy, that shrank the most this past year, closing about half of its stores across the five boroughs.
On 178th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, a sign on the door of a Rite Aid that closed last March advises customers to go to another branch seven blocks south. A Rite Aid spokeswoman said the company made "every effort to ensure our customers have access to health services," whether at another Rite Aid or elsewhere, when a branch closes.
Nearby, two community pharmacies were humming. At Washington Heights Pharmacy and Surgical Supplies, where Goya products are sold in an aisle near the medications, Linda Pierre-Louis, a pharmacist, said that her pharmacy had picked up some patients from the Rite Aid closure, although others couldn't transfer their prescriptions. Some unions and employers require people to get their medications through mail order, or have preferred relationships with chains.
Ms. Pierre-Louis used to work across the street at the Rite Aid, and there, theft was a huge problem. "People would come in with garbage bags; it was very disconcerting," she said.
At her new job, she said, "a lot of our patients are local, we speak the same language." That connection, and a much smaller store to watch, keeps theft down.
St. Jesus Pharmacy, three doors down from the old Rite Aid, was even busier, with about a dozen people working behind the pharmacy counter and a large waiting area filled with patients. Nicole Camarena, a cashier, said she believed the business was thriving because "we are more community oriented."
Dr. Juan Tapia-Mendoza, a pediatrician and founder of a pediatric practice in West Harlem, is hoping that the decline of the chain pharmacies will further boost the independents.
At the chains, he said, pharmacists have little time to answer their phones or give patients advice. "They come and go as business decisions, not with a purpose to serve the people most vulnerable," he said.
He counted five chain pharmacies that had left in recent years in Upper Manhattan, causing disruptions. "They invaded the neighborhood all of a sudden, and they left all of a sudden," he said.
Representatives for the chains said they were making improvements to ensure pharmacists had more time with customers and stressed that they were a vital part of the health of communities across the country.
"Even when we make the difficult decision to close a store, it doesn't mean we have left the community," a Walgreens representative said, adding that there is usually another Walgreens store nearby.
But not all is rosy for the independent pharmacies. Their sector, experts warn, is fragile, with small drugstores around the country also closing as a result.
And shoplifting is still a problem for many. Drugstores in the city, including chains and independents, experienced twice as many thefts in 2022 compared with 2019, rising from 6,031 to 12,343 incidents. Since 2006, pharmacy theft has risen by more than 500 percent -- more than any other category of retail, according to a recent report by researchers at John Jay College.
The Hamilton Pharmacy on Broadway and West 133rd Street was robbed six times between May and July, the pharmacist and owner, Henna Patel, said. Because she can't afford to hire security, she now has a buzzer on the front door, so customers have to buzz in like a bank, and she closes the store now at 6 p.m. instead of 7 p.m.
"I have 32 security cameras, and people still have audacity to steal," she said.
Still, she added, "that's a very minor one of my problems."
A far bigger issue, she said, is low reimbursements for the medications she sells. Across the industry, a significant percentage of the drugs that pharmacies sell do not generate enough revenue to cover costs.
"Let's say we are buying an $ 3,300 H.I.V. medication; if you're giving us $ 250 less, or $ 150 less, where are we going to recover that?" Ms. Patel asked.
At St. Jesus Pharmacy, a small sign taped to a shelf in the cold-medicine aisle hints at a cause of the problem: "Speak out against PBMs," it says.
The sign refers to pharmacy benefit managers, little-known companies that act as middle men to negotiate prices between drug manufacturers and retailers. They also influence what medications insurance plans cover.
P.B.M.s take a percentage of the profit generated by drug sales, but do not typically disclose how much. The largest benefit managers -- Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Optum Rx -- have close relationships with chain pharmacies and insurance companies. But independent pharmacies have little leverage if, for example, they get reimbursed less for a drug than a chain does.
Chris Krese, a spokesman for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, an industry group, said that chains were also under threat from low reimbursements stemming from the role of the benefit managers. But the trade association for P.B.M.s, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, maintains that they protect consumers and employers from even higher prices by negotiating for discounts from drug companies.
In 2022, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a new law aimed at regulating the benefit managing companies. However, much of the regulation promised by the legislation has yet to go into effect.
The reimbursement shortfalls mean community pharmacies are constantly trying to make ends meet in other ways. More and more, they operate like old-fashioned general stores, offering all kinds of additional products and services: passport photos, tax filing, lottery tickets, bill payment, UPS drop-off, vision testing for driver's licenses.
At Esco Pharmacy in Hell's Kitchen, in operation since 1940, owner Danny Dang is opening a cafe in the front of the shop to sell juices. His pharmacy is also one of only a handful in Manhattan that sells pepper spray, which requires special verification.
Because of a recent change in New York State's Medicaid rules, he now earns a guaranteed $ 10 for filling each Medicaid prescription, helping him stay afloat. Still, he estimates that he's losing money on 30 percent of his prescriptions now, compared with 60 percent before the change.
"We have to navigate and be a survivor," he said.
Photograph Top, Washington Heights Pharmacy and Surgical Supplies in northern Manhattan recently picked up new customers when a Rite Aid closed nearby. Above, Esco Pharmacy in Hell's Kitchen often loses money on medications, but its owners sell other products to get by.

Neil Drossman, 83, Who Brought Humor and Wit to Advertisements: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His sense of humor was evident in widely seen pitches he wrote for Meow Mix ("Tastes so good, cats ask for it by name") and many other products.
Neil Drossman, who brought a cheeky wit and a tireless work ethic to the award-winning print advertisements and television commercials he wrote for clients like Meow Mix cat food, Teacher's Scotch whisky and 1-800-Flowers, died on Nov. 25 in the Bronx. He was 83.
His daughter, Jill Drossman, said he died of sepsis in a hospital.
From the late 1960s until this year, Mr. Drossman was a copywriter and an executive at several agencies, some run by the advertising guru Jerry Della Femina and some he helped run himself.
"He was one of the smartest people I know, very low key, and he had a passion," Mr. Della Femina, who hired Mr. Drossman at Della Femina, Travisano & Partners in the early 1970s, said in a phone interview. "He really wanted to win."
One of the most enduring lines Mr. Drossman wrote was for Meow Mix: "Tastes so good, cats ask for it by name." That came at the end of commercials in which cats appeared to sing ("Meow meow meow meow/Meow meow meow meow") for their chicken and seafood.
For Stick Ups, small deodorizing disks made by Air Wick that could be glued anywhere in the house, he wrote commercials that had the punchline "This is a good place for a Stick Up."
For a 1-800-Flowers print ad, Mr. Drossman wrote: "There are 800 reasons for sending flowers. Guilt is 700 of them."
And for Chemical Bank, to send the message that each of its branches served its neighborhood differently, he wrote, "Flatbush ain't Flushing." The line that followed -- "Flatbush is the ghost of Ebbets Field and Jackie Robinson stealing home" -- was personal: It harked back to his upbringing in Brooklyn, his love for the Dodgers and his anger at their move to Los Angeles when he was a teenager.
Paul Kruger, a creative director and partner at Della Femina Advertising, where Mr. Drossman worked until recently, described him as indefatigable.
"He was an idea machine," Mr. Kruger said. "He would spit out line after line after line and come up with new stuff. He'd say, 'One more thought, one more thought."'
In 1973 and 1974, Mr. Drossman ghostwrote full-page testimonials for Teacher's Scotch in the voices of celebrities like Groucho Marx, George Burns and Mel Brooks. The Brooks ad was written as an interview with Mr. Brooks's character the 2,000 Year Old Man.
"Sir, when was Scotch discovered?"
"It was during the Ice Age. We had so many tons of ice, we didn't know what to do. So we made drinks, all kinds of drinks."
The Teacher's campaign won Della Femina, Travisano a Clio Award for creative excellence in advertising. It also earned Mr. Drossman a writing award from what is now the One Club for Creativity.
Mr. Drossman and his colleagues earned Clio Awards in 1980 for three campaigns -- for Air Wick Stick Ups, Meow Mix and the carpet store Einstein Moomjy. His Emery Air Freight ads ("It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your package is?") won an award from the One Club in 1978.
Neil Arthur Drossman was born on Feb. 26, 1940, in Brooklyn. His father, Edward, owned a jewelry store. His mother, Anne (Rosenberg) Drossman, took over the store after her husband died in 1971.
After graduating from Alfred University in upstate New York with a bachelor's degree in English in 1961, Mr. Drossman worked at CBS News before beginning his advertising career. Among the agencies he worked for were Daniel & Charles, Delehanty Kurnit & Geller and Kurtz, Kambanis & Symon.
Mr. Della Femina recalled his reaction to seeing ads Mr. Drossman had written for other agencies. "You look at an ad and you say, 'I wish I had done that,"' he said. "His portfolio was full of ads like that."
After working at Della Femina, Travisano and a subsidiary, Drossman Yustein Clowes, for about a dozen years, Mr. Drossman formed Drossman Lehmann Marino Reveley in 1983. In 1994, he joined Ryan & Partners as an equity partner, and the agency became Ryan Drossman & Partners. In 2002, he and the art director Bob Needleman started Needleman Drossman & Partners, which became a division of Della Femina Advertising.
When Reader's Digest hired Needleman Drossman in 2003 to refresh its image, Mr. Drossman pushed that venerable publication into slightly risqué territory. One of the ads in the campaign showed a woman in a bathrobe holding a copy of the magazine and looking into the camera.
"If we got any closer to our readers," the headline read, "we'd have to use protection."
Mr. Drossman, then the chairman and co-creative director of his agency, said the goal of the campaign was "to make people think twice about the Digest."
In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Ellen (Danor) Drossman; his son, Edward; his sister, Phyllis Bulhack; and three grandchildren. He lived in Manhattan.
Not all of Mr. Drossman's copywriting was humorous. In 2008, in a commercial extolling Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey for ranking among America's 50 best hospitals, a young boy was shown playing alone with a glove and a baseball.
"If every hospital performed that well," the narrator says, "hundreds of thousands of lives would be saved. Who knows, maybe Finn wouldn't be alone now. Maybe he'd be having a catch with his grandfather."

DHL Workers Walk Out At Kentucky Cargo Hub: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Workers who load and unload cargo planes at DHL's hub near Cincinnati walked out after months of negotiations failed to produce a contract.
More than 1,100 workers at DHL Express's global air cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport went on strike on Thursday after months of failed negotiations with the parcel carrier.
A group of DHL workers at the hub who load and unload planes voted in April to unionize with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has been in contract negotiations with the company since July. The union has filed more than 20 unfair labor practice complaints with the National Labor Relations Board since then, accusing the company of retaliation against organized workers. Teamsters Local 100, which represents the unionized workers, voted to authorize a strike on Sunday.
"The company forced this work stoppage, but DHL has the opportunity to right this wrong by respecting our members and coming to terms on a strong contract," Bill Davis, president of Local 100, said in a statement.
DHL Express is the U.S. unit of the world's largest logistics company, Deutsche Post, but accounts for only 2.3 percent of the market in the United States in package volume, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. As a German company, it is not able to ship between domestic airports within the United States, so it has to contract out those services and instead focuses on handling international shipments.
A DHL spokesman said the company "was fully prepared for this anticipated tactic and has enacted contingency plans" like redirecting shipments to avoid Cincinnati and adding replacement staff members.
The company noted that roughly 4,000 employees at the facility were still on the job. It said it did not "anticipate any significant disruptions to our service performance."
"Unfortunately, the Teamsters decided to try and influence these negotiations and pressure the company to agree to unreasonable contract terms by taking a job action," the company spokesman said in a statement.
The DHL strike comes at a time of increased tensions in the industry between companies and organized labor.
On Thursday, the Teamsters threated to strike at a United Parcel Service facility in Louisville, Ky., accusing the company of engaging in "similar practices to disrespect and abuse our members in the same state" by laying off administrative workers who had just voted to unionize. The union threatened to strike at UPS as well if it "doesn't get its act together" by Monday.
UPS narrowly averted a strike over the summer after contentious negotiations with the Teamsters, which threatened to halt operations for the country's largest parcel service.
The facility where DHL workers are striking is directly in front of Amazon's Air Hub, where a unionization effort is underway. Workers there have accused Amazon of illegally impeding organizing efforts.

The Agony of Striving Parents and Pressured Children: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: A surprisingly tender one-man show guides us through the dubious business of tutoring the children of striving New York parents.
Of the many vexing demands made of eighth graders applying to public high school in New York City, a process so byzantine it seems designed to get their parents to move to New Jersey, perhaps the strangest revolves around the "Fantastical Sandwich." In addition to a portfolio that includes seven examples of original creative work, students interested in certain art and design programs must submit a pencil drawing that stages, as the Department of Education instructions put it, "an interesting scene of a character eating a sandwich in 3 phases."
This appears relevant only if your focus is in animation, a decision the system expects a child to have made while still clinging to spaceship jammies. But if you plan to concentrate on graphic design, then you must come at lunch from a different angle, conjuring a new neighborhood restaurant and designing a subway poster for its specialty sandwich, which needs to include a catchy slogan.
While the particular exercise goes unmentioned in "School Pictures," a one-man Off Broadway show about the indignities of late-stage middle-school life in a city defined by toxic competition and inequity, the absurdity infuses its spirit. The writing and performance comes to us from Milo Cramer, a playwright who spent several years making rent as a tutor, mostly working with 12- and 13-year-olds who were preparing to enter challenging high schools.
Often the remit was to help them study for the Specialized High School Admissions Test, or SHSAT, the sole criteria for entry to schools like Stuyvesant and Bronx Science, places with which Mr. Cramer, who grew up amid the simpler folkways of suburban Connecticut, had little experience.
As a young artist living in Brooklyn with no children, Mr. Cramer absorbed all the chaos and longing from just the right psychological vantage -- one that gives the play a layered, compassionate view of the striving urban parents and pressured children so routinely distilled to cliché.
Too often, theater about contemporary social disruptions plays out merely as the reductive paraphrase to an extant body of nonfiction work that really knows what it is talking about. Here, the opposite feels true. Mr. Cramer is young, uncooked and open enough to receive these children as they are, foregrounding their voices in all of their complexity and self-contradiction, their resistance and silence and honesty and delight, taking you where the opinion writer or cultural anthropologist can't.
The setup, a pseudo musical, has Mr. Cramer wailing funny songs that tell the stories of individual, fictionalized students accompanied by a ukulele and, at one point, a toy piano. There's Divya, who needs help with a five-paragraph essay that must address the hamfisted question: "Is 'Othello' racist?" She has no idea.
"I'm like, 'Have you read the play?"' Mr. Cramer sings. "She's like, 'Yes, and I watched the Laurence Fishburne movie.' I'm like, 'Great, so what do you think?' She's like, 'Dunno, I'm 15, I'm afraid to say the wrong thing."' The narrator is just as afraid.
At the heart of the play are questions about what is really worth knowing and what sacrifices warrant the effort in a system in which success seems so arbitrarily distributed. The production opened just as thousands of families around the city have found themselves in the midst of the high school application process, racing toward the deadline on Dec. 1. Year after year, application after application, it never isn't awful. Recently, in a Facebook group devoted to questions and laments about the particulars of this onerous undertaking, a mother posted about students in her daughter's class who cried and threw up after taking the SHSAT this fall.
Beyond the world of test-in schools are dozens of others where acceptance is granted according to an alchemy of merit, need and chance, which parents are left spending thousands of hours trying to decipher and game. You are likely to miss days of work -- presuming that is even possible -- going to open houses and finding no obvious choice for the child who plays the harp and loves STEM but also wants a baseball team. Or you might fall deeply in love with a school where Restoration comedy is taught in 10th grade but discover that there is zero chance of getting in because you are stuck with a terrible lottery number that arrives long enough to look like a UPS tracking code.
Mr. Cramer, who uses the plural pronoun, wonders about their role in this sorting factory, and whether they are engaged in dark-arts complicity or an honorable act of service. What real wisdom, the play asks, can a tutor impart? And what value would that wisdom even hold for students who don't believe that the world will be around by the time they are 30?
There were families who were scraping together the money to pay for instruction, and some cases where, as Mr. Cramer recounted to me, "the kid is already a small business; you're there with the maid and the music teacher." It struck Mr. Cramer that so many parents wanted their children to take music lessons, "but they don't want their kids to be musicians."
For a long time, Mr. Cramer also worked at a patisserie in Park Slope where former Mayor Bill de Blasio was a regular. As we learn in the show, while receiving daily one-dollar tips from him, Mr. Cramer worried about being spotted by tutoring clients, imagining that more than anything else, those parents probably did not want their children to become Brooklyn baristas. "I really felt like a fraud at first," Mr. Cramer told me. "You have to present like you are the pathway to collegiate success." No matter how empty you have seen it to be.
The system, Mr. Cramer has observed at the end of it all, is designed "to make kids hate themselves," wherever a bourgeois understanding of achievement is taken as gospel. "All my friends feel like failures," Mr. Cramer said, "and it is because we all came up in it."

Retailers Need You to Buy That Diamond Ring. No, Seriously.

Entering a make-or-break season, companies need consumers to buy that diamond ring, or plane ticket, or Barbie.
Jewelry
The winter holidays are even bigger than Valentine’s Day for Kay Jewelers and Jared, owned by Signet Jewelers: They sold more than 1 million diamond rings and bracelets last season, more than double the previous quarter. Signet expects to see an engagement boom this holiday.
Airlines
This year, the Transportation Security Administration expects that a record 30 million people will fly during the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday period. Airlines expect an average of 2.7 million passengers to travel each day, up 9% from last year’s levels. The Sunday after Thanksgiving will be especially busy, with a record 3.2 million passengers expected.
Thanksgiving
On Thanksgiving Day, Americans consume an estimated 46 million turkeys, or roughly 20% of all turkeys produced during the year, as well as one-fifth of the cranberries produced. This year’s feast will cost 4.5% less than last year’s, with the price of the centerpiece bird down 16%.
Coffee
Last year, holiday shoppers bought about 58 million Starbucks gift cards and loaded them up with a record $3.3 billion, or 10% of Starbucks’ annual revenue, to give to teachers, babysitters and others. The busiest day for gift card purchases last year was Dec. 23.
Books
The bookstore chain Barnes & Noble does one-third of its annual business in the final six weeks of the year, selling more than 20 million books in December alone and racking up 20 times the sales of an average week in the seven days before Christmas. The one day when men outnumber women among its customers? Christmas Eve.
Candy
Christmas is the confection industry’s biggest holiday, outpacing Valentine’s Day, Easter and Halloween. Consumers will spend about $5.6 billion on chocolate, candy canes and other holiday treats.
Toys
Mattel and Hasbro make about 60% of their annual sales in the second half of the year, when retailers start building up inventory for the holiday season. For Mattel, which last year sold $3.15 billion of toys during the second half, all eyes will be on Barbie this season.
Packages
Last holiday season, the U.S. Postal Service delivered 11.7 billion holiday cards and gifts, nearly 10% of the total for 2022. UPS said it planned to hire 100,000 seasonal employees to process and deliver packages.
Retailers
The fourth quarter — the three months that include the holiday season — is retailers’ most lucrative. In that period last year, Macy’s made one-third of its annual revenue, Nordstrom saw about 28% of its yearly take, and big-box chains like Target chalked up almost 29% of annual sales.

Full text: Chris Caputo stood on the tarmac at Burlington International Airport in Vermont in early October and looked to the clouds in the distance. He had piloted military and commercial aircraft over a long career, racking up thousands of flight hours, but the trip he was about to take would be very different.
That's because the airplane Mr. Caputo would fly runs on batteries. Over the next 16 days, he and his colleagues flew the plane, a CX300 built by their employer, Beta Technologies, down the East Coast. They would make nearly two dozen stops to rest and recharge, flying through congested airspace over Boston, New York, Washington and other cities.
When the journey came to an end in Florida, Beta handed the plane over to the Air Force, which will experiment with it over the next few months. The trip offered a vision of what aviation could look like years from now -- one in which the skies are filled with aircraft that do not emit the greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming up the Earth.
"We're doing some really meaningful work for our state, our country and the planet," Mr. Caputo said. "It's hard not to want to be a part of it."
A Flurry of Activity
For most of aviation history, electric aircraft have been little more than a fantasy. But technological advancements, particularly in batteries, and billions of dollars of investment have helped make short-distance electric air travel feasible -- and, its backers hope, commercially viable.
Beta, which is privately held, has raised more than $ 800 million from investors like Fidelity, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund and the private equity firm TPG Capital. The company employs about 600 people, mostly in Vermont, and recently finished building a factory in Burlington where it plans to mass produce its aircraft, which have yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.
The first will be the CX300, a sleek, futuristic plane with a 50-foot wingspan, large curved windows and a rear propeller. That plane is designed to carry about 1,250 pounds of cargo and will be followed soon after by the A250, which shares about 80 percent of the CX300's design and is outfitted with lift rotors to take off and land like a helicopter. Both aircraft, which Beta markets as the Alia, will eventually carry passengers, the company says.
Beta is one of many companies working on electric aviation. In California, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are developing battery-powered aircraft capable of vertical flight that, they say, will ferry a handful of passengers short distances. Those companies have backers like Toyota, Stellantis, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and large investment firms. Established manufacturers like Airbus, Boeing and Embraer are also working on electric aircraft.
The U.S. government has mobilized behind the industry, too. The F.A.A. aims to support operations of aircraft that use new means of propulsion at scale in one or more places by 2028. And the Air Force is awarding contracts and testing vehicles, including Beta's CX300 and an aircraft that Joby delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in California in September.
'Almost One With the Plane'
Beta's plane is not as large and powerful as the jets that Mr. Caputo flew for the Air Force, Air National Guard or Delta. But what it lacks in heft, it makes up for in charm, he said, noting that the airplane is incredibly quiet and responsive, making it a pleasure to fly.
"You're almost one with the plane," Mr. Caputo said, adding later: "You can kind of hear and feel the air going across the flight control surfaces. We wear helmets right now because it's experimental and safety is paramount, but we can literally take the helmets off in the aircraft and just talk to one another."
Mr. Caputo said the CX300 and other electric aircraft could open up new opportunities, like better connecting rural areas that have little or no direct air service.
Beta's airplane has flown as far as 386 miles on a single charge, but the company said it expected its customers to generally use it to carry out trips of 100 to 150 miles. The plane's journey to Florida was allowed under limited authority granted by the F.A.A.
In addition to producing no emissions, electric aircraft are designed to be simpler to operate and maintain than conventional helicopters and planes. But they are not expected to take to the skies in large numbers for years. Initially, their trips are likely to be short -- from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport, for example, or Burlington to Syracuse, N.Y.
Modern batteries can support limited range and weight. As a result, the aircraft that they power can generally carry only a handful of passengers, or the equivalent load in cargo.
Early on, electric aircraft are expected to compete mainly with helicopters and cars and trucks. In cities, widespread flights won't be possible without expanded infrastructure like vertical landing and takeoff sites and public support. The cost of producing such aircraft will also be high to start, limiting their use to the well-heeled and to critical services like medical evacuations, experts said.
In some ways, the challenge and the promise of electric aviation today are like those of the automobile at the turn of the 20th century, said Kevin Michaels, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, an aviation consulting firm.
"You had several hundred manufacturers around the world, all with their own unique approaches to making these machines, but you didn't have the roads, you didn't have traffic lights, you didn't have insurance," he said. But, he added, the industry eventually found its way. "Things settled down 20 years later, and eventually costs fell, and winners emerged. And it changed the way things were done, the way people lived."
Aiming to Earn Trust
Kyle Clark, Beta's founder, is attuned to those concerns, which is why, he said, Beta has taken a more methodical approach.
"I get it, the industry has a trust issue," he said. "It's too much change, too quick, in an industry that has an exceptionally high standard of safety."
The company plans first to win F.A.A. certification next year for a motor it has developed, followed by approvals of its first and second aircraft in subsequent years. The CX300 will use runways to move cargo, avoiding the need for new infrastructure, Mr. Clark said.
That approach has been endorsed by several customers, according to Beta, including the shipping giant UPS and United Therapeutics, which plans to use the vehicles to transport organs for transplant. Bristow Group, another customer, plans to use the aircraft the way it uses helicopters today, to transport goods and people to offshore energy installations, run search and rescue missions for governments, and for other purposes.
Bristow, which is working with eight companies developing next-generation aircraft, expects the vehicles to create new opportunities because they are quieter than helicopters and are expected to be 60 to 70 percent cheaper to operate, according to David Stepanek, an executive vice president at Bristow.
In addition to building aircraft, Beta is establishing a network of chargers that can power its aircraft as well as cars, trucks and other vehicles. More than a dozen have been set up, including one at the Air Force site in Florida, making it the military's first electric aircraft charging station.
The company also built a prototype landing site for aircraft capable of vertical flight, which sits atop repurposed shipping containers, which house energy storage and a small living space for pilots to rest between trips.
The day that Beta's aircraft left Burlington in October, Mr. Caputo flew it on two legs, arriving at sunset at Griffiss International Airport in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, near where he grew up. He ordered Italian food for the Beta team from a restaurant he used to frequent with his family, and his mother drove out to see the aircraft in person for the first time. The next morning, he flew the plane to Syracuse, N.Y., and handed it over to colleagues who would fly it the rest of the way.
Much of the popular discussion about electric aircraft revolves around the idea that they will effectively be used as flying cars to whiz people around big cities. In the near future, though, they may just as likely be used to ferry goods and passengers outside dense urban areas, in places like upstate New York and Vermont.
"To me, it's going to have a really meaningful impact on how we move organs and goods and services," he said, "and reconnect the rural parts of America that I think get often forgotten."

Autoworkers Score Big Victories In New Contracts Ending Strikes: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tentative accords at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis are the most generous in decades, raising costs as the industry shifts to electric vehicles.
A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has resulted in tentative contract agreements that would give workers their biggest pay raises in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
On Monday, General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached a deal that mirrored agreements the union had reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers like Tesla and Toyota.
The tentative agreements, which still require ratification by union members, also appeared to be a win for President Biden, who had risked political capital by picketing with striking workers at a G.M. facility in Michigan last month.
"They have reached a historic agreement," Mr. Biden said Monday after speaking with Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president. The deals, the president said, "reward autoworkers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago."
The strike stretched longer than White House officials would have liked, but was resolved before causing significant shortages of new cars and trucks that might have frustrated voters already angry about inflation.
"The near-term impact of this strike will be relatively minor," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online auto sales site.
But Mr. Brauer warned that, in the long term, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis would have to raise car prices to maintain their profits. Their competitors will follow suit to take advantage of the opportunity to earn more money, he said. "This is going to make cars more expensive," Mr. Brauer added.
G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement on Monday that the tentative agreement "reflects the contributions of the team while enabling us to continue to invest in our future and provide good jobs in the U.S."
Potentially the most far-reaching effect of the strike could be on manufacturing workers not represented by the U.A.W. The contracts the union negotiated are the latest in a series of prominent victories for organized labor, including Hollywood writers, UPS workers and even some university employees.
Mr. Fain has portrayed the tentative agreements as a signal for the union to begin organizing drives at Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing electric car business, and foreign-owned companies like Toyota, Honda and BMW that have large nonunion operations in the United States. The union will "organize like we've never organized before," Mr. Fain said Sunday.
Companies without unions can expect the U.A.W. to deploy the same hardball tactics that Mr. Fain used against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to pre-emptively give workers raises.
"This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect," said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25 percent pay increase over the next four and a half years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top U.A.W. wage would rise to more than $ 40 over the life of the new contracts, from $ 32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $ 84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford's case, workers at battery factories that the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The U.A.W. said its new contract with G.M. would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automakers' costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
"Everybody had their pencils out, and I'm quite certain the deal wouldn't have been signed if they weren't confident they could remain competitive," said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Mr. Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Mr. Biden's brief stint on a U.A.W. picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Mr. Biden -- that the contract hinders automakers' competitiveness -- is unlikely to become manifest before next year's election.
The union's contracts with the three automakers, covering nearly 150,000 workers, expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the U.A.W. told workers to go on strike at G.M.'s plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies' most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade S.U.V., the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco S.U.V.
G.M. said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $ 800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford's deal with the U.A.W. would shave about one percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, like a decline in consumer's ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
"I don't think the U.A.W. in a vacuum is going to be the big problem," Mr. Narayan said. "There are other problems these companies have."
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $ 900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, Calif.; Sparks, Nev.; and Buffalo. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company's advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers, who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, G.M. and Stellantis.
"We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for E.V.s," Ms. Barra said last week.

A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has resulted in tentative contract agreements that would give workers their biggest pay raises in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
On Monday, General Motors and the United Auto Workers reached a deal that mirrored agreements the union had reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers such as Tesla and Toyota.
The tentative agreements, which still require ratification by union members, also appeared to be a win for President Joe Biden, who had risked political capital by picketing with striking workers at a GM facility in Michigan last month.
“They have reached a historic agreement,” Biden said Monday after speaking with UAW President Shawn Fain. The deals, Biden said, “reward autoworkers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.”
The strike stretched longer than White House officials would have liked, but was resolved before causing significant shortages of new cars and trucks that might have frustrated voters already angry about inflation.
“The near-term impact of this strike will be relatively minor,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online auto sales site.
But Brauer warned that, in the long term, Ford, GM and Stellantis would have to raise car prices to maintain their profits. Their competitors will follow suit to take advantage of the opportunity to earn more money, he said. “This is going to make cars more expensive,” Brauer added.
GM CEO Mary T. Barra said in a statement on Monday that the tentative agreement “reflects the contributions of the team while enabling us to continue to invest in our future and provide good jobs in the U.S.”
Potentially the most far-reaching effect of the strike could be on manufacturing workers not represented by the UAW. The contracts the union negotiated are the latest in a series of prominent victories for organized labor, including Hollywood writers, UPS workers and even some university employees.
Fain has portrayed the tentative agreements as a signal for the union to begin organizing drives at Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing electric car business, and foreign-owned companies such as Toyota, Honda and BMW that have large nonunion operations in the United States. The union will “organize like we’ve never organized before,” Fain said Sunday.
Companies without unions can expect the UAW to deploy the same hardball tactics that Fain used against Ford, GM, and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to preemptively give workers raises.
“This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect,” said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25% pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top UAW wage would rise to more than $40 over the life of the new contracts, from $32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford’s case, workers at battery factories the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The UAW said its new contract with GM would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automaker’s costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
“Everybody had their pencils out and I’m quite certain the deal wouldn’t have been signed if they weren’t confident they could remain competitive,” said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Biden’s brief stint on a UAW picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Biden — that the contract hinders automakers’ competitiveness — is unlikely to become manifest before next year’s election.
The union’s contracts with the three automakers covering nearly 150,000 workers expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the UAW told workers to go on strike at GM’s plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies’ most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade SUV, the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco SUV.
GM said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford’s deal with the UAW would shave about 1 percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, such as a decline in consumer’s ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
“I don’t think the UAW in a vacuum is going to be the big problem,” Narayan said. “There are other problems these companies have.”
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, California; Sparks, Nevada; and Buffalo, New York. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company‘s advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, GM and Stellantis.
“We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for EVs,” Barra said last week.

Amid Global Uncertainty, Wall Street Takes Another Tumble: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/amid-global-uncertainty-wall-street-takes-another/docview/2882165916/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street dropped nearly 10 percent below its high mark for the year on Thursday after big-name companies warned that an uncertain global economy may hurt their profits.
The S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent for its ninth drop in 11 days and touched its lowest level in five months. Another steep fall for Big Tech dragged on the market, sending the Nasdaq composite to a market-leading loss of 1.8 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average sank 0.8 percent.
Meta Platforms was among the market's heaviest weights and tumbled 3.7 percent even though the parent company of Facebook and Instagram reported fatter profit and revenue for the summer than analysts expected.
Investors may have been spooked by the company's warning that it has seen some initial softness in advertising due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and analysts said the company gave a wider range than it has in the past for its forecast of upcoming revenue.
Meta is one of the Big Tech stocks that were responsible for a huge chunk of the S&P 500's gains through the first seven months of the year. Two other Big Tech companies offered reports earlier this week that Wall Street saw as mixed, with Alphabet tumbling 9.5 percent and Microsoft rising 3.1 percent on Wednesday.
Thursday's further drops for Big Tech came even though yields eased in the bond market, which has been at the center of sharp moves for financial markets around the world for months.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.84 percent from 4.96 percent late Wednesday. Early in the morning, it had neared its highest level since 2007. Yields swung after reports showed that the U.S. economy continues to storm ahead despite much higher interest rates that have already lashed the stock market.
A preliminary estimate suggested the U.S. economy's growth accelerated during the summer by more than economists expected. A separate report indicated the U.S. job market remains solid, with relatively few layoffs across the country. And the European Central Bank refrained from raising interest rates for the first time in more than a year.
Stocks have been under pressure since the summer as Treasury yields have spurted higher. They have been catching up with the main interest rate controlled by the Federal Reserve, which is at its highest level since 2001 as the central bank tries to get inflation under control.
Thursday's reports show the U.S. economy is clearly not in a recession. But Wall Street is worried that a solid economy could put continued upward pressure on inflation. That could push the Fed to keep rates high for a long time, weakening the economy and corporate profits.
"The Fed's job isn't done, and it does not appear that higher interest rates are doing the job for them," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.
In the near term, traders overwhelmingly expect the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady at its next meeting, which ends Wednesday. That would mark a second straight meeting where the Fed did not raise its main interest rate, which it has pulled above 5.25 percent from nearly zero early last year.
Even better-than-expected profits from big U.S. companies haven't been enough to arrest the market's recent slide.
The majority of companies in the S&P 500 have been topping analysts' profit expectations for the summer, and the hope is that they'll report their first overall growth in a year. But several big-name companies fell Thursday following disappointing results or forecasts for upcoming trends.
UPS, for example, sank 5.9 percent after cutting its forecasts for some full-year results because of uncertainty about where the global economy is heading. Investors see UPS as a window into the global economy's strength because it ships so many products around the world.

Retailers’ Seasonal Hiring Plans Signal a Cooling Labor Market

As the most important selling season for retailers approaches, job applicants may feel a chill.
Macy’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods plan to hire fewer seasonal workers after a surge in the past two years, when shoppers thronged to stores after pandemic lockdowns and employers struggled to keep up. Many retailers have dropped the incentives they used over the past few years to bring workers in the doors, such as signing or referral bonuses and steeper employee discounts.
The career site Indeed said that searches for seasonal jobs were up 19% from last year, but that listed positions were down 6%. Companies helping businesses find temporary workers note that major retailers have been slower to release hiring plans this year. And on Indeed, fewer job postings are described as urgent needs.
Seasonal hiring helps retailers handle the increased shopping during the fourth quarter, often referred to as “peak season.” Sales in November and December can account for one-quarter of some retailers’ annual revenue. In the weeks leading up to Christmas, foot traffic in stores and online shopping are usually at their height.
Early estimates point to an increase in retail spending this holiday season, but not at the fast pace of recent years.
Some economists and consultants see the trends in hiring and pay as a sign that the red-hot labor market of the past couple of years has cooled. Retailers’ workforces, unsteady throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, are starting to stabilize. As inflation erodes shoppers’ budgets and confidence — and savings from pandemic relief programs are drawn down — the hiring plans may be part of a cautious approach that extends to inventories and sales projections.
“The seasonal hiring market looks a whole lot more like 2019 than those pandemic bounce-back years,” said Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research for Indeed. “I really do think this is emblematic broadly of what we’re seeing in the U.S. labor market, where demand for workers overall is fairly strong but down from where it was in the last year and a half.”
Macy’s is aiming to hire 38,000 workers, 3,000 below its 2022 plan. In 2021, Macy’s said it aimed to hire 76,000 people — in both permanent roles and seasonal jobs — during the holiday season. Of those positions, 48,000 were temporary.
Dick’s said it would hire up to 8,600 seasonal workers, down from targets of 9,000 last year and 10,000 in 2021 — and up only slightly from 8,000 in 2019.
Target and UPS plan to hire the same number of workers as last year, about 100,000 each. In a statement, Target said its seasonal associates would supplement the hiring it had done throughout the year to staff up its stores and supply chain facilities.
“This year, we are starting the season with stability in our workforce and a continued commitment to scheduling flexibility for our team, which has helped us retain team members and create a more experienced workforce,” the company said in a post on its blog.
Walmart, the nation’s biggest retailer, echoed that sentiment.
“I’m also excited that we’re staffed and ready to serve customers this holiday season,” Maren Dollwet Waggoner, senior vice president of people at Walmart U.S., said in a post on LinkedIn. “We’ve been hiring throughout the year to be sure we’re ready to serve customers however they want to shop.”
A Walmart spokesperson added that if a store had additional staffing needs during the holiday season, it would offer extra hours to current employees before looking externally. Walmart did not say how many seasonal workers it planned to hire this year, as it did in years past. (In 2022, it said it was looking to fill 40,000 seasonal positions, including truck drivers and call center workers.)
Amazon is a notable exception, saying it will hire more seasonal workers this year — 250,000, up from 150,000 last year. It also said that a $1.3 billion investment would bring the average hourly wage of those jobs to more than $20.50 and that it would still offer signing bonuses in some locations.
Matching staffing to demand helps ensure that retailers eke out as many sales as they can.
Seasonal workers are “the folks that are on the front lines of their business,” said John Long, North America retail sector leader at the consulting firm Korn Ferry, adding that aside from a store’s inventory, they “are going to be the make-or-break piece of the equation of whether the retailer makes their numbers or they don’t.”
After paring their workforces during the worst of the pandemic, employers in the retail and hospitality industries scrambled to fill open positions as workers sought more flexibility, switched companies frequently or stood on the sidelines. To get back to pre-pandemic staffing, retailers have used evergreen requisitions — continually displayed postings advertising essential roles that often need to be filled — and have started hiring seasonal workers as early as August.
They have also given more hours to part-time workers and relaxed qualifications. To reduce turnover, many companies have bumped up their base wages for hourly positions.
These factors have complicated the explanation for reduced seasonal hiring this year, said Melissa Hassett, a vice president at Manpower Group who works with large retailers, logistics and distributors across the country.
“If you’re always hiring, you’re just not going to see an increase in postings happen very often,” she said. “So sometimes when you look at the increase in postings for retail it’s not as accurate as you think it is.”
But there is also a feeling that the leverage of retail job applicants will fade.
“In the past it felt like the workers had a lot more upper hand in terms of being able to demand what they need,” Yong Kim, founder of the staffing platform Wonolo, said. That dynamic has changed, especially for temporary positions.
“There is definitely more tightening around companies wanting to hold off on hiring unless they really need to” and waiting to see how the fourth quarter pans out, Kim said.

Amid Strikes, One Question: Are Employers Miscalculating?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: UPS, the Hollywood studios and the Detroit automakers appear to have been taken aback by the tactics and tougher style adopted by new union leaders.
The list of gains that the Hollywood writers secured to end a nearly five-month strike with studios once seemed ludicrously ambitious: not just wage increases, but also minimum staffing levels for shows, new royalties on successful series and restrictions on outsourcing writing duties to artificial intelligence.
Yet far from an anomaly, the writers' deal was the latest high-profile labor standoff that seemed to produce substantial gains for workers, and to suggest that they have more leverage than in the past.
United Parcel Service employees won large pay increases for part-timers by pushing the company to the brink of a strike, while the lowest-paid academic student employees at the University of California won salary increases of more than 50 percent after a monthlong strike affected thousands of students.
Given the unions' apparent bargaining power and the economic costs to a prolonged work stoppage, the question arises: Why wouldn't management make its eventual concessions more quickly?
The answer, many union and management experts say, is that employers are increasingly miscalculating -- acting from a template that applied in previous decades, when employees had little leverage, and underestimating the frustration and resolve in the postpandemic work force.
"Psychologically, it's a big shift: They've been in control. They have been able to tell their representatives to go and get concessions on X and Y, to make sure the wage increase is modest," said Thomas Kochan, an emeritus management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to corporate executives.
"Now, they have to change their expectations internally," Dr. Kochan added. "They have a lot of work to do."
In example after example, executives appear to have been taken aback by unions' new, more assertive leaders and their success at rallying members and the public, as well as the ineffectiveness of the employers' traditional bargaining approach.
In Hollywood, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents entertainment companies in negotiations with writers, directors and actors, has frequently tried to forge a deal with one of the three guilds, then push the other two to accept similar terms.
That appeared to be the group's strategy this year as well: After the writers went on strike in May, the alliance reached a deal with directors the next month. But any hope that the writers would be isolated collapsed when SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 actors, went on strike in July.
"The playbook was clearly outdated," said Peter Newman, a longtime independent producer who heads a dual-degree master's program in business and fine arts at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.
Still, Mr. Newman said, the strikes saved the studios hundreds of millions of dollars on shows in the short term as Wall Street was pressuring them to cut costs.
The producers' alliance declined to comment for this article.
In Detroit, the three major U.S. automakers had grown accustomed to closed-door negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union, in which the parties did not disclose the potential terms until they reached an overall agreement.
But in the run-up to this year's mid-September strike deadline, the union's new president, Shawn Fain, appeared to wrong-foot executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis -- which makes the Chrysler and Jeep brands -- by disclosing and deriding the companies' offers. In one case, he literally threw a Stellantis proposal in the garbage.
The companies' responses -- a Stellantis executive sent employees a letter saying that "theatrics and personal insults will not help," while Ford and G.M. have also expressed impatience -- may have further galvanized members and built public support. Polls have found that the public supports the autoworkers over the companies by large margins, and that the margins increased after the U.A.W. began a limited strike.
"It doesn't seem like they were prepared for the direction he was headed with his public comments," David Pryzbylski, a labor lawyer who represents employers at Barnes & Thornburg, said of the reaction to Mr. Fain. "The way they have responded may have escalated it further versus letting it die out."
Stellantis declined to comment. Auto industry executives argue that they have made historically generous offers, and that they haven't been put off by Mr. Fain's outspokenness so much as what they say are the showmanship and the unrealistic expectations he has created.
Mr. Pryzbylski emphasized that it was too early to tell whether the landscape had tilted to labor's advantage for the longer term, or just temporarily. The outcome of the U.A.W. strike remains unclear, and the workers' resolve could diminish if the strike drags on for weeks. Talks between the sides are ongoing.
Other management-side lawyers said that while a handful of executives might have miscalculated of late, there was no broader trend in this direction. They say that employers remain capable of assessing and acting in their self-interest, and that unions are equally capable of miscalculating.
"People are sophisticated on both sides," said Marshall Babson, a longtime management-side lawyer and former member of the National Labor Relations Board. "From my experience, good negotiators don't get distracted by pyrotechnics."
But in many cases, what has changed is not so much the bluster from union leaders as their willingness to follow through -- a potentially disruptive shift after years of often empty threats.
When Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters president, ran to succeed his longtime predecessor, James P. Hoffa, in 2021, he promised to raise wages for part-time workers at UPS, many of whom had long felt shortchanged.
And yet, according to two people close to the negotiations, the company seemed caught off guard when talks broke down over the issue on July 5 -- Mr. O'Brien's initial deadline.
Mr. O'Brien and the union spent the next few weeks publicly attacking UPS over what the union referred to as "part-time poverty" jobs before the company agreed to hourly wage increases for part-timers of more than $ 7.50 over the life of the new five-year contract.
Shortly after a tentative deal was reached in late July, the UPS chief executive, Carol Tomé, said the company had expected the negotiations "to be late and loud, and they were." The company declined to comment for this article.
Part of the challenge for employers is public opinion: Confidence in big business is at its lowest point in decades, according to Gallup, while approval of labor unions is close to its highest. Mr. Fain and Mr. O'Brien appear to have devised their public campaigns to press this advantage.
Unions also appear to have benefited from new methods of keeping members focused on shared goals -- as when writers erupted on social media over the news that the talk show hosted by Drew Barrymore would return before the strike ended. (Ms. Barrymore soon reversed course.)
And rank-and-file members appear to have become more committed to their leaders' negotiating strategy as unions have become more democratic and involved members more in the push for a contract, said Jane McAlevey, a longtime labor organizer and scholar.
But perhaps most important, employers seem to be underestimating the determination of workers, who believe they have little to lose from striking amid rising prices and fundamental shifts in their industry that have sometimes made their jobs more precarious.
A few weeks after the writers walked off the job this spring, Mae Smith, a strike captain and former writer on the Showtime series "Billions," predicted in an interview that the economic pain of a protracted strike against the studios would not discourage the writers because "unfortunately they've been training us to live off very few months of work for a long time."
The prediction largely held, in something of a departure from the 2007 writers' strike. Back then, when streaming felt like a distant threat, there were some splits within the Writers Guild over how aggressive to be, said Chris Keyser, a past president of the union.
This time, the writers appeared particularly unified by the looming role of artificial intelligence, an issue on which the studios largely refused to engage for months.
"A number of C.E.O.s, when we talked to them later about A.I., said that was a mistake," recalled Mr. Keyser, a co-chair of the writers' negotiating committee this year.
(The writers did compromise on some key issues in the end -- there is no ban on studios' use of scripts they own to train A.I. tools, though the guild reserved the right to challenge instances of this.)
Dr. Kochan of M.I.T. said the concession from studios on artificial intelligence was especially significant because it highlighted another shift: employers' diminished ability to limit negotiations to conventional issues like wages and benefits while often reserving the right to control other aspects of the job, like technology adoption.
"For decades, management has been able to say: 'These are our decisions, our prerogatives. It's none of your business,"' he said.
With the breakthrough on artificial intelligence, he added, "this is a new day -- that's why the writers' strike was so important."

A New Kind of Deal Bringing a Swift Concert to a Theater Near You: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A recent change in antitrust law made it easier for the singers to bypass big movie studios when seeking distribution for their concert films.
Just before Taylor Swift's concert film, "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," passed $ 100 million in global ticket presales this week, its distributor, AMC Entertainment, announced that it had struck a similar deal with Beyoncé for the singer's Renaissance tour. Both projects follow tours that became cultural phenomena and pushed sales records, and the films are expected to be hits themselves.
The deals behind them are also unusual. Most big movies are distributed by a major studio. But Swift instead bypassed the studios, produced the concert film herself and sought distribution through AMC, a theater company rather than a movie studio. Theaters will keep less than half of the ticket proceeds, while Swift and AMC are expected to split the remainder. Ticket prices for adults will start at $ 19.89, a price that nods to the name of a Swift album and her birth year.
Beyoncé 's deal for a release of her concert film in December appears to have parallels with Swift's arrangement.
AMC Entertainment, which stands to profit handsomely, may not have struck these deals if it weren't for a recent tweak to antitrust law.
DealBook spoke to Makan Delrahim, the former D.O.J. antitrust division chief who proposed that change to the law in 2018, about how it facilitated the pop stars' movie deals.
Swift's agreement includes some terms that would have been unlikely a few years ago. In 1938, The D.O.J. sued what were then the Big Five studios -- MGM, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers -- for monopolizing the movie industry and forcing exhibitors to take unfavorable deals. In 1948, the studios entered into the "Paramount consent decrees," which limited their ability to own or control theaters. Over time, these decrees became de facto standards for the industry, Delrahim said, and Swift and Beyoncé may not have been able to make the deals they did if the decrees were still in effect.
Delrahim said he saw the decrees -- which were created before streaming, cable and television had established new types of competition for theaters -- as a "misguided form of government intervention in the free markets" that "stunts innovation and pro-consumer business practices." After a period of public comment, he asked a federal judge to dissolve the consent decrees, and the court agreed. The expiration of certain parts of the decrees has allowed for new innovations in movie deal making, Delrahim said.
Swift was able to make one deal with AMC for all of its theaters, and it could make deals with other movie theater chains that covered all of their theaters. Under the Paramount consent decrees, standard practice was to negotiate with theaters individually instead of licensing to a block of theaters at once. But because the law changed, Swift did not need to negotiate with individual theaters. She only had to negotiate with AMC. The new way is "much more efficient and allows for innovative practices such as the Taylor Swift deal with AMC," Delrahim said.
Another change allowed for minimum ticket prices. Previously, a studio couldn't require a theater to keep prices above a particular floor. "Had the decrees been in effect, it's likely that the specific price that Ms. Swift required for her upcoming film, which reflects her birthday year, wouldn't have been allowed," he said. "Given the early demand, it's probably underpriced, but it's great for the consumer and for Ms. Swift's fans." Beyoncé's tickets will be priced at $ 22, also a minimum price that would not have been tolerated in the time of the decrees.
Not everyone is a fan of the new norms for movie deals. Some have argued that the dissolution of the decrees have made things more fair for major studios competing with streamers while leaving independent producers to struggle to get their movies shown and exhibitors to have trouble bringing certain films to their theaters. Critics have said a more effective alternative would have been enshrining the restrictions into updated regulations that applied widely to all industry players, including relatively new entrants like streaming services, instead of eliminating norms. But as Swift might say, and has sung, "Would've, Could've, Should've." -- Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Sam Bankman-Fried's trial finally begins. A founder of FTX, the failed cryptocurrency exchange, appeared in federal court this week as prosecutors and defense lawyers squared off on whether the company failed because of fraud. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.
Kevin McCarthy is ousted as House speaker, leaving Congress without a leader and effectively halting all legislation. Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking House Republican, and Jim Jordan of Ohio are among those seeking to replace McCarthy, though its unclear whether either lawmaker have enough support to win.
The S.E.C. goes after Elon Musk again. The agency is suing the tech mogul to force him to testify over his purchase of Twitter last year. The S.E.C. is investigating whether Musk broke securities laws in rapidly accumulating shares of Twitter ahead of his $ 44 billion takeover of the social media platform, now named X.
Exxon Mobil is reportedly in talks to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a major shale driller, in a $ 60 billion takeover that would be the biggest deal of the year.
The strike economy, by the numbers
What had been a summer of strikes is stretching well into the fall -- and involving more and more workers.
Tens of thousands of workers at Kaiser Permanente, the giant health care system, walked off the job this week after they failed to reach a deal on a new contract. That has substantially expanded the number of Americans on the picket line to at least 250,000 workers, the most since several statewide teacher strikes in 2019.
Here are the biggest employee actions taking place now:
SAG-AFTRA, which represents 150,000 actors, is closing in on a third month of a strike that continues to cripple Hollywood.
The United Automobile Workers has more than 25,000 members on picket lines against the Big Three Detroit automakers. (That represents less than 20 percent of the total U.A.W. members working at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis because the union is targeting a small number of locations at a time, a strategy that allows it to preserve its strike fund and maintain pressure longer.)
More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers walked off the job in five states and the District of Columbia, one of the largest health care strikes in recent U.S. history.
Another 300,000 workers nearly walked off the job this summer, but UPS agreed to a new labor contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in August, narrowly avoiding a strike. And about 11,500 screenwriters went back to work last week after leaders of the Writers Guild of America voted to end their 148-day picketing of major Hollywood studios. (The W.G.A. won a surprisingly high number of concessions from media companies, analysts said.)
Labor stoppages were once much bigger: In 1970, there were at least 2.4 million workers on strike, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today's numbers are "a lot -- relative to the 21st century," said Johnnie Kallas, director of the Labor Action Tracker at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell.
The "Great Resignation" no more
The great resignation is officially over. Data released this week showed that the rate of workers quitting their jobs fell back to its prepandemic level in August, after a surge of resignations driven by a tight labor market and other factors, such as many service workers having the rare opportunity to trade up for better pay and work environments as the economy reopened after the pandemic. Friday's job report showed the labor market remains strong: The economy added an unexpectedly high number of jobs in September, and the unemployment rate remains near record lows. But the belief that it will be easy to get a better job seems to have waned.

Air Taxis Have Landed, Vertically and Quietly. First Stop: The Air Force.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Joby Aviation delivered the aircraft, which can carry a pilot and four passengers, to Edwards Air Force Base in California for testing.
The Air Force said on Monday that it had received its first electric passenger aircraft capable of taking off and landing vertically, a milestone for the companies that hope to one day sell thousands of such vehicles to serve as air taxis.
Joby Aviation, an air taxi start-up, delivered the aircraft to Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California, where the first supersonic flight took place. Air taxis are typically powered by batteries and designed to lift off and land like helicopters, but include wings to fly like airplanes.
Joby, which is based in Santa Cruz, Calif., said that its electric aircraft is substantially quieter than helicopters or planes. Each can carry one pilot and four passengers and travel as fast as 200 miles per hour and as far as 100 miles, according to the company.
The delivery is the first under an Air Force contract that Joby said was valued at up to $ 131 million and gives the government the option to receive up to nine aircraft. The Air Force and Joby will operate the vehicle, but Joby will still own the aircraft and receive both fixed and variable payments for hours flown. NASA, which has a facility at the base, will also conduct research on the vehicle.
The Air Force has signed similar contracts with other air taxi companies under a program called Agility Prime, part of a broader effort to promote innovation. Agility Prime's mission is to support development of air taxis and similar technology, giving the Air Force a head start in exploring how it might use such aircraft while also providing financial and testing support to the air taxi companies.
"It is incredibly valuable for us to be getting to do early operations and to build the operational muscle," Joby's chief executive, JoeBen Bevirt, said. The collaboration will help Joby in several ways, including in learning how best to train pilots and maintain and charge aircraft in real-world situations.
Joby and other air taxi companies, including Archer Aviation and Beta Technologies, are separately rushing to get the Federal Aviation Administration to certify their aircraft for commercial flight. All three companies hope to begin commercial service as soon as 2025. The F.A.A. has said it is preparing to support robust air taxi operations by 2028.
But because the agency does not govern aircraft used by the military, air taxi companies have eagerly pursued defense contracts while they work toward F.A.A. approval.
At Edwards Air Force Base, Joby's aircraft will be tested as a means to transport cargo and people. The vehicles could also be used to monitor the expansive base or tested to conduct medical evacuations, for example. All told, the Air Force has more than 100 performance measures it wants to evaluate, said Beau Griffith, the deputy lead of Agility Prime.
"Bearing out the promise of these vehicles is the program's goal," he said.
NASA will work closely with the military and Joby in testing the aircraft, with the aim of using its research to guide air taxi development and support the F.A.A. Starting next year, NASA pilots and researchers will explore how Joby's vehicle would operate in a typical city environment, examining flight procedures and how it could interact with air traffic control and local infrastructure. Joby's aircraft is expected to remain at the base for at least a year, and the company has plans to deliver another in 2024.
Other leading air taxi companies have similar partnerships. Archer, in Santa Clara, Calif., announced this summer that it had signed Air Force contracts valued at up to $ 142 million, which included delivery of up to six aircraft similar to Joby's. Beta, in Burlington, Vt., is the first electric air taxi manufacturer to receive an airworthiness certificate for manned flight from the military, with pilots from both the Air Force and the Army having flown its aircraft. That company is also installing the first electric aircraft charging station at a military installation.
In addition to support from the military, the air taxi industry has received substantial support from other aviation and automotive companies.
Joby's investors include Delta Air Lines and Toyota, which is Joby's largest external shareholder and is helping the air taxi manufacturer as it builds a factory in Ohio. Archer recently received investments from Boeing, United Airlines and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, which is helping Archer to establish a factory in Georgia. And Beta is collaborating with UPS to test deliveries in the United Arab Emirates and has raised funds from Fidelity and other investors.

For Tesla and Musk, Auto Strike Carries Benefits and Risks

The United Auto Workers strike against the Michigan automakers would seem to be nothing but good news for Tesla, the electric vehicle maker that has upended the industry and stolen customers from Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Ram.
Unencumbered by an activist union, Tesla can take advantage of the work stoppages to add to its substantial lead in battery technology and software. As the three established automakers face increases in labor costs and struggle to master electric vehicles, Tesla can twist the knife by lowering car prices because it is much more profitable than most automakers.
But the UAW’s determination to secure a big victory for its members, amid a nationwide resurgence in union activism, harbors risks for Tesla and Elon Musk, its CEO, who has attacked and ridiculed unions on his social media network, X, formerly Twitter.
The UAW, which has failed to organize Tesla’s factory workers in the past, is gearing up for another attempt, a top union official said.
“There is a group of Tesla workers who are actively talking about forming a union and creating the best representation they can for themselves and their co-workers through collective bargaining,” said Mike Miller, the director of the UAW’s Region 6, which includes California and Nevada, where Tesla makes cars and batteries. Tesla also has a large factory in Austin, Texas, not too far from a unionized GM factory in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
In an interview, Miller declined to provide more details or identify the Tesla workers, saying they needed time to prepare before going public. This union-organizing effort is separate from a campaign at a Buffalo, New York, plant where Tesla makes electric vehicle chargers and employs data entry workers.
But as representatives of the national union demand 40% wage increases from the Detroit automakers, along with significant gains in benefits, they are certainly thinking about the signal that any deal would send to nonunion workers at Tesla.
“Clearly, the narrative out there is that this can’t be good for the Big Three, and if it’s not good for the Big Three, it’s good for Tesla,” said Rahul Kapoor, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
But, he added, “If I’m an autoworker with wages lower than what Ford and GM are paying, and I hear there is a substantial increase, it’s very likely I would want to take that into account.”
The president of the UAW, Shawn Fain, fired a warning shot at Musk on Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”
“Most of these workers in those companies are scraping to get by so that greedy CEOs and greedy people like Elon Musk can build more rocket ships and shoot theirself in outer space,” he said.
A lot has changed since 2016, when a group of workers at Tesla’s auto assembly plant in Fremont, California, began an organizing drive that never acquired enough momentum to come to a vote.
Back then, Tesla was a struggling upstart flirting with bankruptcy. Now Tesla dominates the market for electric vehicles, with a 60% share in the United States. It is worth vastly more on the stock market than the three established U.S. automakers combined. It is arguably in a better position to reward workers than its rivals.
Yet labor organizing is arduous. Activists must get at least 30% of workers to sign union cards and force a vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. Companies often do all they can to dissuade workers from joining, hiring lawyers and consultants who specialize in defeating union campaigns.
Even if a majority of workers cast ballots in favor of a union, winning pay increases and better benefits comes only after negotiations that can drag for years. Amazon workers at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse voted in April 2022 to unionize, but Amazon has challenged the result and has yet to begin bargaining on a contract.
Still, Tesla would be a tempting target for unions. The company reported profit of $2.7 billion on sales of $25 billion in the second quarter, giving it a profit margin of about 11%. That profit margin is more than that of Ford or GM, even after an exceptionally profitable period for those companies. Stellantis, which was created by the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, reported an 11% profit margin in the first six months of the year but lost market share in the United States.
Tesla’s stronger financial performance has allowed it to significantly cut car prices, making it harder for the established carmakers to gain ground in electric vehicles. The least expensive Model 3 sedan costs about $33,000 after federal tax credits, less than comparable gasoline vehicles.
The climate for organized labor is better than it has been for years. President Joe Biden is a big supporter of unions. Hollywood writers and actors are on strike, a high-profile manifestation of labor activism. In August, UPS employees won their biggest raises ever in a contract negotiated by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk seemed to acknowledge the union threat last week, saying on X that his workers were better off than employees of GM, Ford and Stellantis. “We pay more than the UAW,” he said, although he added that “performance expectations are also higher.”
The traditional automakers quarreled with Musk’s math, saying that they pay their workers substantially more and that a big raise would only widen the gap and undermine their ability to invest in electric vehicle and battery factories. Ford says its hourly employees make an average of $112,000 per year including benefits, compared with about $90,000 at Tesla.
The Ford figures do not include stock options that Tesla grants employees, and that can be worth a lot. Musk has said that some production workers have become millionaires from their shares in the company.
Stock options can be lucrative but also risky. Tesla has not detailed how often or in what amount it distributes options to rank-and-file workers. In regulatory filings, the company has said the options those workers receive have a vesting period, meaning that employees must remain at the company for a certain period to cash them in.
Tesla workers may lose their options if they are fired or forced to quit because of injury or poor health, said Bryan Schwartz, a lawyer in Oakland, California, who has represented the company’s employees in lawsuits against the company.
“There are lots of issues with options to the degree workers can really count on them,” Schwartz said.
Stock awards fluctuate in value along with Tesla’s share price. The stock peaked at more than $400 in late 2021, plummeted to a little more than $100 last year and rebounded this year to $270. The uncertainty may be unsettling for workers trying to make mortgage payments and pay for child care.
“If I was a Tesla worker, with all these other companies making EV’s, I would prefer a wage,” said Rick Eckstein, a professor of sociology at Villanova University who follows labor issues.
Tesla has a reputation as a tough place to work, with long hours and punishing deadlines. Schwartz has sued Tesla on behalf of Black employees who say they faced discrimination in promotions and work assignments and were subject to racist abuse. Tesla has denied the accusations.
Any union drive would face forceful opposition from Musk. The National Labor Relations Board has found that Musk illegally threatened employees in 2018 by implying they would lose their stock options if they voted to unionize. The labor board also found that Tesla illegally fired one of the lead organizers.
An appeals court upheld the board’s decision. Tesla, which argues that Musk and the company did nothing wrong, is appealing the court ruling.
Without doubt, the strike poses huge risks for the Detroit automakers, which were slow to take Tesla seriously and stand to lose precious time they need to catch up.
“The real winner in the UAW strike will likely be the auto company that has been winning all along,” Gary Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, an investment firm that owns Tesla stock, said on X.
But any schadenfreude among Tesla investors could be brief.
“The strike could be a bellwether,” said Eckstein. “It’s a hot time in the labor movement.”

Since the start of the pandemic, labor unions have enjoyed something of a renaissance. They have made inroads into previously nonunion companies like Starbucks and Amazon, and won unusually strong contracts for hundreds of thousands of workers. Last year, public approval for unions reached its highest level since the Lyndon Johnson presidency.
What unions haven’t had during that stretch is a true gut-check moment on a national scale. Strikes by railroad workers and UPS employees, which had the potential to rattle the U.S. economy, were averted at the last minute. The fallout from the continuing writers’ and actors’ strikes has been heavily concentrated in Southern California.
The strike by the United Automobile Workers, whose members walked off the job at three plants Friday, is shaping up to be such a test. A contract with substantial wage increases and other concessions from the three automakers could announce organized labor as an economic force to be reckoned with and accelerate a recent wave of organizing.
But there are also real pitfalls. A prolonged strike could undermine the three established U.S. automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — and send the politically crucial Midwest into recession. If the union is seen as overreaching, or if it settles for a weak deal after a costly stoppage, public support could sour.
“Right now, unions are cool,” said Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, a firm representing management.
“But unions have a risk of not being very cool if you have five-month strike in LA and an X-month strike in how many other states,” he added.
If the stakes seem high for the UAW, that’s partly because the union’s new president, Shawn Fain, has gone out of his way to elevate them. During frequent video meetings with members before the strike, Fain has portrayed the negotiations as a broader struggle pitting ordinary workers against corporate titans.
“I know that we’re on the right side in this battle,” he said in a recent video appearance. “It’s a battle of the working class against the rich, the haves versus the have-nots, the billionaire class against everybody else.”
Fain’s framing of the contract campaign in class terms appears to be resonating with his members, thousands of whom have watched the online sessions.
Shunte Sanders-Beasley, a UAW member in Michigan who started working at a Chrysler plant in Indiana in 1999, said she saw the fight similarly.
“If you follow history, autoworkers tend to set the tone,” said Sanders-Beasley, who has served as vice president of her local and backed Fain’s campaign for the union’s presidency last year. “If we can win back some of the concessions we took, I’m hoping that it’ll be a trickle-down effect.”
A successful autoworker strike in 1937, which led GM to recognize the UAW for the first time, helped set in motion a wave of union organizing across a variety of industries like steel, oil, textiles and newspapers over the next few years.
Labor activists agreed that the current strike could reverberate across other industries, where workers appear to be paying close attention to the labor actions of the past year. “In organizing meetings, they say, ‘If they can do it, we can do it,’” said Jaz Brisack, an organizer with Workers United who played a key role in the Starbucks campaign.
But the flip side is that the strike could inflict collateral damage that creates frustration and hardship among tens of thousands of nonunion workers and their communities.
“The small and medium-sized manufacturers across the country that make up the automotive sector’s integrated supply chain will feel the brunt of this work stoppage, whether they are a union shop or not,” Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement Friday.
Higher wages and gains for rank-and-file workers can be good for the economy. But some argue that Fain’s and other labor leaders’ aggressive demands could discourage businesses from investing in the United States or render them uncompetitive with foreign rivals.
“Mr. Fain has to think about this, too: the long-term financial viability of these three companies,” said John Drake, vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Even those who welcome the union’s aggressive stance say it is fraught with risk. Gene Bruskin, a longtime union official who helped workers at a Smithfield meat-processing plant in North Carolina achieve, in 2008, one of the biggest organizing victories in decades, said he strongly favored the strike and how Fain and the union are seeking to rally the working class.
But he said a long strike could disillusion workers if the union came up short on key demands.
“If the UAW fails to make any significant gains, particularly on the two-tier stuff, their future could be seriously harmed,” said Bruskin, referring to a system in which newer workers are paid far less than veteran workers who perform similar jobs.
Bruskin also worried that the union could effectively win the battle and lose the war if the auto companies respond by shifting more production to Mexico, where they already have a significant presence.
The tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies for domestic production of electric vehicles that President Joe Biden has helped secure should limit that shift and help keep manufacturing jobs at home. Many automakers are already locating new plants in the United States to take advantage of the funds.
Still, Willy Shih, an expert on manufacturing at Harvard Business School, said the automakers could adjust their operations in ways that undercut the UAW while continuing to produce cars domestically. Automation is one option, he said, as is locating new plants in lightly unionized Southern states.
The Detroit automakers have created joint ventures with foreign battery makers outside the reach of the UAW’s national contracts and have sought to locate some of those plants in states like Tennessee and Kentucky. The union is seeking to bring workers at those plants up to the same pay and labor standards that direct employees of the Big Three enjoy, but it has not succeeded so far.
Given those threats, the union may feel justified in taking a more ambitious posture toward the automakers. The primary check on shifting work to other states will be the UAW’s ability to organize new plants, especially in the South, where it has struggled to gain traction for years. Experts argued that the union would probably increase its chances of attracting members there if it could point to large concrete gains.
“The answer is winning a strong contact here and using it to organize huge groups of autoworkers who are currently nonunion,” said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies labor.
And there are other ways in which being too cautious may be a bigger risk to the union than being too aggressive. Organizers point out that workers are often demoralized when union leaders talk tough but then quickly settle for a subpar deal.
Critics of the previous UAW administration accused it of doing just that before Fain took over this year. “We’d be trying to make sense of how certain things passed in the first place,” Shana Shaw, another longtime UAW member who backed Fain, said of the concessionary contracts autoworkers were asked to accept over the years.
Even Fain’s habit of framing the fight in broad class terms may prove to be a strategic advantage. A recent Gallup poll found that 75% of the public backed the autoworkers in the showdown, compared with 19% who were more sympathetic to the companies.
The widespread public support suggests that the autoworkers may be operating in a different context from workers in another strike that famously contributed to a loss of power for labor: air traffic controllers’ unsuccessful fight against the Reagan administration in the early 1980s, after which private-sector employers appeared to become more comfortable firing and replacing striking employees.
Eidlin said that while the air traffic controllers failed to court allies in the labor movement, “the fact that Fain and the UAW are messaging more broadly, really trying to build that broad coalition, speaks to the possibility of a different outcome.”

Full text: Experts on unions and the industry said the U.A.W. strike could accelerate a wave of worker actions, or stifle labor's recent momentum

Full text: The vote by members of the Teamsters union removes a potential threat to the economy.
Averting a strike that could have shaken the U.S. economy, the union representing more than 300,000 United Parcel Service employees announced Tuesday that its members had ratified a new labor agreement with the shipping giant.
The union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said that its UPS members approved the five-year contract with more than 86 percent support.
The Teamsters have said that the agreement includes wage gains of at least $ 7.50 an hour for current employees over its five-year term. It also raises the minimum pay for part-time workers to $ 21 an hour from under $ 17, and raises the top rate for full-time delivery drivers to about $ 49 on average.
Under the previous contract, which expired on Aug. 1, full-time drivers made an average of about $ 42 an hour after four years on the job.
In a statement, the union's president, Sean O'Brien, said the contract was the most lucrative ever at UPS and would serve as a model for other workers that the union is seeking to organize. "This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention," Mr. O'Brien said.
The Teamsters have made unionizing Amazon a top priority in recent years, and Mr. O'Brien said while running for the union's presidency in 2021 that doing so would first require big, concrete gains at other companies.
Despite the ratification, the new UPS contract will not take effect immediately. The union said in its statement that a group of workers in Florida voted down a supplement to the national contract that covers about 175 members -- one of 44 supplements that the union also negotiated.
The union said its negotiators would immediately meet with UPS to resolve the remaining issues so that those Florida members can vote again. The national contract will take effect once the supplement is approved.
UPS declined to comment beyond a brief news release noting the ratification vote and stating that the Florida supplement would be "finalized shortly."
The Teamsters had been aggressive in mobilizing members and ratcheting up pressure on the company in recent months, including picket-line practice and training sessions for strike captains. Mr. O'Brien has frequently referred to corporate leaders as a "white-collar crime syndicate" and argued that "this multibillion-dollar corporation has plenty to give American workers -- they just don't want to."
UPS moves about one-quarter of the tens of millions of packages shipped in the United States each day, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. Its adjusted net income rose more than 70 percent from 2019 to last year, reaching more than $ 11 billion.
The negotiations on a national contract began in April, and the union announced in mid-June that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.
The two sides resolved many key issues by early July, including eliminating a lower-paid category of full-time driver that had angered many UPS employees, and requiring air conditioning in new trucks to improve heat safety. But then negotiations broke down, with the Teamsters arguing that the company had not offered sufficient improvements in pay for part-time workers, who make up more than half of the union's UPS members.
Mr. O'Brien and the union spent the next few weeks condemning what they sometimes referred to as "part-time poverty" jobs, before the sides resumed negotiating in late July and quickly finalized a tentative deal.
UPS employees represented by the union began voting on the agreement in early August. While some part-time workers continued to argue that the wage gains should have been even larger and urged a "no" vote, the final margin suggested that most were satisfied with the deal.

Propelled by Angry Union Members, New Leaders Are Taking a Harder Line: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Pushed by angry members, unions representing actors, autoworkers and UPS employees are becoming increasingly assertive under new leadership.
Shawn Fain is not a typical president of the United Automobile Workers union.
Mr. Fain recently declined a symbolic handshake with the chief executives of the major Detroit automakers, a gesture that traditionally kicks off contract negotiations. He is seeking an ambitious 40 percent wage increase for rank-and-file members -- in line, he says, with the pay gains of those corporate leaders over the past four years. And in a video meeting with members this month, Mr. Fain threw a list of proposals from Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler and Jeep, into a wastebasket, saying it belonged in the trash "because that's what it is."
On one level, the circumstances that produced the union's more aggressive leadership are idiosyncratic. Mr. Fain, who won his position in March, is the first president in the union's history, dating back nearly 90 years, to be elected directly by its members. The change took place after a major corruption scandal engulfed two of his predecessors and several more union officials.
But on another level, the forces that swept Mr. Fain into power are the same ones that have borne down on unions across a variety of industries: a feeling among members that they have spent years enduring out-of-touch leaders, meager wage growth and concession-filled labor agreements, which forced some to do similar jobs as co-workers for less pay.
"We kept being told, 'This is a good contract,"' said Shana Shaw, a U.A.W. member who has worked at a General Motors plant in Missouri since 2008. "And our members are saying, 'It's not a good contract!"'
The long-simmering rage helps explain why, in addition to Mr. Fain, several prominent unions are now in the hands of outspoken leaders who have taken their membership to the brink of high-stakes labor stoppages -- or beyond.
Sean O'Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, has repeatedly referred to corporate leaders as a "white-collar crime syndicate" and warned that a strike of the union's 300,000-plus United Parcel Service members appeared inevitable. (The union recently reached a tentative agreement that members are voting on.)
Just after a union of more than 150,000 Hollywood actors called a strike in July, Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, said that she was "shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us." She added: "It is disgusting. Shame on them!"
The companies, including UPS and the automakers, have indicated that they are willing to increase compensation but cannot jeopardize their long-term viability. The large Hollywood studios have offered actors pay increases but say they must be able to adapt to the decline of traditional television.
Some executives have called out the unions' more confrontational gestures. "The theatrics and personal insults will not help us reach an agreement," Mark Stewart, a top Stellantis official, said in a letter to employees after Mr. Fain literally discarded the company's proposals.
And channeling members' anger is not without risk: It can raise expectations and make it difficult for leaders to finalize contracts. Mr. O'Brien is facing a "vote no" campaign organized largely by UPS part-timers who argue that the union did not secure large enough raises.
The populist approach is not unique to labor unions. The 2008 financial crisis and the grindingly slow recovery produced a more militant style of politics that upended established institutions around the world. The crisis helped lay the groundwork for the unexpected support of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race.
If anything, unions were slower to adapt to the rising anger than other institutions, largely because they were less democratic.
In 2018, UPS employees voted down a labor contract negotiated by the Teamsters leadership, which created a new category of lower-paid drivers. The union's president, James P. Hoffa, who had served in the position for nearly 20 years, used a procedural rule to impose the contract anyway.
But even the change-averse labor movement could not withstand a final blow: Covid-19, and union members' anger over their perilous working conditions as corporate profits grew at one of the fastest rates in decades.
"There's a historical memory of all the concessions they made," said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist of labor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, referring to union members. "And they feel shafted. The C.E.O.s are sitting pretty with all this pandemic money that didn't go into their pockets."
Many nonunion workers saw their wages rise rapidly thanks to a tight job market, but contracts negotiated before the pandemic often locked union members into smaller wage increases as inflation surged.
Mr. O'Brien has tapped into that resentment.
A vice president and ally of Mr. Hoffa in the mid-2010s, Mr. O'Brien ran to replace him in 2021, deriding his predecessor for foisting concessionary contracts onto members. He vowed to raise pay for part-timers at UPS -- an unusual concern for a would-be Teamster president, even though part-timers make up a majority of the union's members there -- and secured a significant wage increase.
Other union leaders have followed a similar arc. In 2021, Ms. Drescher ran for president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union now on strike, on the union's moderate slate and narrowly won. But she came to channel her members' anxieties over the rise of streaming, which has led to longer gaps in work for many actors and more limited royalties as shows are reused less often.
"The streaming contracts negotiated back at the beginning of this, when certain individuals thought this would be a fad, set us up for failure," said Linsay Rousseau, a SAG-AFTRA member who works primarily as a voice actor. She said Ms. Drescher's outspokenness had won over even members who voted against her.
In some cases, outraged rank-and-filers have taken matters into their own hands. Edward Hall, a rail worker and local union official in Tucson, said he decided to run for the presidency of the more than 25,000-member Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen in early 2022. The union's longtime president had arrived to hold a town-hall meeting about labor negotiations that had dragged on for over two years. But, Mr. Hall said, he was unable to provide frustrated members with a timetable for a deal. (Dennis Pierce, the former president, declined to comment.)
Mr. Hall was elected last fall, shortly after Congress intervened to enact a labor agreement that members of several rail unions had voted down. Many workers felt the agreement did not go far enough to rein in a system of railroad operations that sought to minimize equipment and employees.
"It was profitable for them," Mr. Hall said, referring to rail carriers. "But for lack of a better way to put it, it made life on the railroad hell for regular employees."
The combination of agitated members and more assertive leaders can sometimes pry loose concessions from employers even without a strike, especially amid a worker shortage. This year, rail carriers began voluntarily addressing one of the workers' biggest concerns: the lack of paid sick days.
At UPS, Mr. O'Brien spent months preparing his members for a possible strike, even holding training sessions for strike captains and practice pickets. The pressure appeared to yield significant gains in the recent tentative agreement between the two sides, including more than $ 7 an hour in raises over the five years of the contract.
In an interview last month, Mr. O'Brien said the Teamsters' actions under his leadership had made the strike threat credible. "We've been striking since I took over," said Mr. O'Brien, pointing to other companies where the union represents workers.
David Pryzbylski, a labor lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers, said the strident rhetoric of union leaders often reflected a genuine shift in workers' attitudes. Still, he added, negotiations more often hinge on fundamentals like a company's profitability and the union's ability to disrupt operations through a strike, making it wise for employers to ignore the bluster.
"A lot of times that stuff stops: They go out and say what they wanted to say, they send up a signal flare and move on," Mr. Pryzbylski said. "If you start responding, it stays in the news cycle."
The full-throated demands can also backfire in economic terms. Yellow, a trucking company with 30,000 employees, declared bankruptcy several months after talks with the Teamsters broke down. The company's chief executive said in a statement that the Teamsters' intransigence drove Yellow out of business, though analysts note that the company showed signs of mismanagement for years.
The risks may be even higher in industries under pressure to embrace a new business model.
The major U.S. automakers have said that they need the ability to team up with nonunion battery manufacturers to secure additional capital and expertise. But Mr. Fain, the new U.A.W. president, has said that the failure to organize more battery workers was a major failure of his predecessors, and that battery workers must receive the same pay and working conditions that union workers enjoy at the Big Three.
Many U.A.W. members say the tension between the automakers' goals and the union's indicates that a strike will be hard to avoid when their contract expires in mid-September. But they do not appear to be shrinking from that possibility.
"We have an extremely well-oiled machine," said Ms. Shaw, who also serves as a co-chair of the organizing committee of Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group within the union that assembled the slate of candidates Mr. Fain ran on. "We'll be ready to go if happens."

Online Retailers Are Taking Advantage of a Public Resource: City Streets: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Between 1961, when the social critic Jane Jacobs published "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," and the Covid lockdowns of 2020, it seemed the residential neighborhoods of Washington, like those of certain other, mostly Eastern cities in the United States, had discovered the secret of happiness and safety in the automobile age: narrow streets.
By law, two-way residential streets in Washington are supposed to be 34 feet from curb to curb, but many are a few feet narrower. The average car is about six feet wide, so parked cars on either side constrict a roadway quickly. Once you account for mirrors, swinging doors and the occasional mis-parked minivan or S.U.V., the two lanes of moving traffic might have only 13 or 14 feet of road space to work with. Drivers can move freely but cautiously, braking to pass. For Jacobs and other urban theorists, that's perfect -- these are not neighborhoods that shortcut-seeking motorists consider worthwhile to barrel through, or where playing children need to fear sudden surprises.
This delicate balance of functionality and inconvenience has been upset. In recent years, and especially since the onset of the pandemic, something has changed on city streets -- not the streets themselves but the implicit social agreement that determines how they are used.
The internet is largely to blame. Waze and other navigation apps have channeled impatient motorists into unpromising-looking byways. But even more consequential has been the quantum leap in e-commerce, which has brought hundreds of thousands of vans onto the streets. They're big. FedEx's Freightliner MT45s and Amazon's Ford Transits, Mercedes-Benz Sprinters and Ram ProMasters are all about eight feet wide. Streets that were tight but passable have often wound up blocked off.
This is more than a quality-of-life issue. As with disputes over bicycling rights and privileged parking access for users of certain alternative fuels, it raises a political question about the use of our roadways. We find ourselves in a de facto negotiation over how Amazon and other delivery networks will compensate the country for their partial takeover of the publicly funded road system that makes up a large part of their work space. Concessions can and should be extracted from Amazon. But the public's leverage is weak, the political dynamics are complex and the alternatives are fewer than they used to be.
One can lament the shortsightedness that brought this state of affairs about. The 1992 Supreme Court decision Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, since overturned, absolved companies from collecting sales tax in states where they did not have a physical "nexus." The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998, which blocked new taxes on internet access, also contained language banning "multiple" and "discriminatory" taxes on e-commerce, further tying states' hands. The upshot was an enduring advantage for internet retailers over bricks-and-mortar stores.
That outcome, though deplorable, is not easy to undo. With half a trillion dollars in annual sales and billions in profits most quarters, Amazon is among the largest employers in many states, and the very largest employer in the richest state: New Jersey. Internet commerce has hollowed out the storefronts of old commercial zones and rendered them useless for anything but face-to-face services such as pouring espresso and painting nails. Those bricks-and-mortar businesses that Amazon and others eliminated were not just market competitors at an individual level -- collectively, they provided an alternative retail infrastructure that might have allowed regulators to drive a harder bargain with Amazon.
Adding insult to injury, the big internet retailers have taken great advantage of a communal resource. The real estate that Amazon and other vendors require to make their deliveries is not private but public. We faced a smaller version of this problem with the surge of urban lunch trucks a decade ago. In many cities restaurant owners complained that the trucks were being allowed to undercut them by commandeering public property, while carrying a far lighter burden in rent, regulations and taxes.
The problem with big deliverers is not only larger, it's also more acute, for they can often use public property at a discount. Since the turn of the century, New York City has reportedly given about $ 750 million in parking ticket discounts to UPS, FedEx and other companies that run up huge double-parking bills. Philadelphia has long shown leniency to double parkers, too (although that is reportedly changing).
In theory, the solution to the problem is simple: charge more for double parking and police the abuse more effectively, perhaps with the help of high-tech apps and road sensors that closely track the movement and location of delivery trucks. That is not so different from the way E-ZPass assesses tolls for the use of highways, bridges and tunnels.
However it works, policing e-commerce on the road will require trade-offs. Consider an example from Philadelphia. Many residents have complained about trucks parked along a new waterfront trail in the city as they load in front of a Dave & Buster's. In an interview on the website of the public radio station WHYY, the city's deputy streets department commissioner, Richard Montanez, pleaded for understanding. He noted that the outlet had brought a new purpose to what had been an abandoned warehouse. "Dave & Buster's was there prior to the city building this trail, and now trail users want the Dave & Buster's gone," he told WHYY. "We understand what the community wants, but the community also wants jobs. It's a very delicate balance."
Fair-mindedness in cases like these means paying heed to gentrifying lifestyle nags and speculative developers -- but without reflexively favoring them over established residents and entrenched interests. The politics of repurposing roads looks like the politics of anything else over the last decade or so: a tense battle between a bunch of elite planners doubting the public's wisdom and a seething public doubting the elite's legitimacy.
Bikes are another example. Based on fleeting declines in car traffic during the Covid lockdowns, many zealous city councils made a big bet on bike lanes. To put it less delicately, they cynically transferred the benefit of lots of public property from car commuters and small retail businesses to bike-riding elites and corporate e-businesses. American drivers are bound to take any new road regime poorly. If recent history is anything to go by, they will understand it as a class-based politics aimed against those who can't afford real estate within biking distance of the city center.
"Why don't we ask the 'no cars!' people how they get their groceries and general supplies?" asked one correspondent in the Inside-Booster, a Chicago community newspaper. "I would venture to guess they are Amazon Prime members, and we can thank their delivery trucks for clogging up our community by double parking while making their deliveries."
We can expect more of this.

The Campers Came Home. Their Duffels Almost Didn't.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Camp Trucking, a delivery service for campers' bags, shut down abruptly, leaving families with few options and causing general havoc.
Paige Axel was working when an unwelcome email arrived. It was from Tyler Hill Camp, where her 14-year-old son, Sawyer, has been a camper for the last seven years. The news was grim: Camp Trucking, the transportation company that had shepherded two duffel bags' worth of Sawyer's belongings to camp and back again, had closed its doors less than two weeks before camp was set to end.
Ms. Axel was flummoxed. She had received a message from Camp Trucking on July 26 confirming the date her son's bag would return home, about 10 days after he did in early August. Now the company was defunct?
Soon, Ms. Axel's phone began blowing up with texts from panicked parents, many of whom had planned post-camp vacations and had paid about $ 200 round trip per bag for door-to-door service -- on top of camp costs, which can run more than $ 15,000 for seven weeks.
Lauren Goldberg, a middle school principal in Chappaqua, N.Y., who has two sons at Camp Killooleet in Hancock, Vt., was angry. "I know that during Covid scary things happened and everyone's struggling with staffing, but it's crazy to not be able to keep your business open to get the bags home," she said.
Moms took to private group chats to vent their frustration and bandy about conspiracy theories. They tried to reach the company, headquartered in Avon, Colo., but no one answered.
Camp directors were equally blindsided. Sam Aboudara had been strolling around Camp Cedar Lake with members of the Secret Service and the White House advance team when he received the information. The camp was preparing for a visit from Doug Emhoff, America's second gentleman and a camp Nah-Jee-Wah alum (he was voted most athletic at age 13).
"It is with profound disappointment that I must acknowledge our inability to fulfill our August responsibilities," Daniel Maguire, Camp Trucking's managing director, wrote on company letterhead. He blamed "the enduring financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic," adding that he had used an inheritance and local lines of credit and remortgaged his home to get July payroll done. But nothing sufficed.
After apologizing for the inconvenience, Mr. Maguire concluded: "When the wound of this news has healed, I will cherish the memories I have."
Mr. Aboudara, the chief operating officer of NJY Camps, a network of Jewish sleepaway camps in Pennsylvania, was frustrated. "We weren't majorly freaking out -- we've got a great team of professionals, and it was an operational issue," he said. But it was an unnecessary nuisance.
The Great Bag Debacle has upended the operations of hundreds of summer camps and the lives of parents from the Poconos to Maine. Camp Trucking, which had been in business since 1974, was the exclusive provider for nearly a hundred camps. An average camper, staying three to four weeks, arrives with two duffels big enough to accommodate a six-foot human, Mr. Aboudara said.
"It obviously was a huge shock," said Gary Glaser, the owner and director of Camp Nock-A-Mixon, in Kintnersville, Pa., which serves about 500 campers and 1,000 duffel bags each summer. "I'm really disappointed with the owner of Camp Trucking. If they had reached out and said, 'We're in some financial trouble,' I would have said, 'My people will help you load the trucks."'
After asking parents for time to sort it out, camp directors began working the phones. Some chartered separate buses just for the luggage. Some linked up with UPS, FedEx or U-Haul. Others reached out to or were contacted by Camp Trucking competitors.
Keith Klein, a senior partner at the Laurel Camps, which has programs in Readfield and Casco, Maine, oversaw about 1,000 campers this summer. Within 18 hours, Mr. Klein and his staff figured out how to shuttle 1,450 duffel bags to 23 states and seven countries in less than a week's time -- with Ship Camps. All bags will be whisked to children's homes. Laurel Camps is footing the bill. (According to a spokesperson for Ship Camps, the company has transported over 10,000 large trunks and duffels. Only about 20 to 25 percent of the camps are paying for these services, which leaves parents to pay the extra costs.)
Parents are disputing the Camp Trucking fees with their credit card companies, but so far there haven't been any resolutions. "We told them they'll probably become creditors in a liquidation and get 20 cents on the dollar in five years," said Mr. Aboudara.
Emails and calls to Camp Trucking headquarters went unanswered. The president of Camp Trucking, Stuart Seller, hung up when contacted. In a subsequent email, he wrote, "There's nothing to say."
In the end, Ms. Axel used a little parental ingenuity to get her child's bags home. She called Natalie Matus of First Class Laundry Services, in West Palm, Fla., which offers post-camp pickup, laundering and clothes sanitization. After Ms. Matus learned about this situation, she offered trucks to pick up more than 30 bags from a warehouse and deliver them directly to families' doors for $ 25 per bag.
Ms. Axel jumped at the opportunity. "It's not over until those trunks are in my garage," she said.

Full text: Yellow, which was lent $ 700 million in U.S. pandemic relief, failed after being a laggard for years in a part of the industry where rivals are doing well.
Yellow, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is now in bankruptcy, three years after it got a $ 700 million federal loan meant to help it weather the pandemic's upheaval. So why are rivals of the 99-year-old freight hauler doing just fine?
Yellow, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, had for years been an industry laggard. Analysts say that most trucking companies are strong enough to keep operating -- even after a steep fall in business following the pandemic boom in purchases of goods -- and that freight is unlikely to be much disrupted by Yellow's demise.
Investors are even betting on the industry's future, sending many trucking stocks sharply higher in recent weeks. "I don't look at Yellow's failure as much of a canary in the coal mine for the broader market," said Avery Vise, vice president of trucking at FTR, a forecasting firm that focuses on the freight industry.
The trucking industry has a variety of tiers. FedEx and UPS handle mostly retail packages. Walmart, Amazon and Target have big private fleets. For-hire truckload companies, hauling goods from a single shipper over long distances, include big enterprises and others with only one to five trucks, a segment that mushroomed in response to demand early in the pandemic.
Yellow, which had 30,000 employees and nearly 12,000 trucks, fell into another group -- the less-than-truckload sector, in which truckers fill containers with goods from more than one shipper and operate a hub-and-spoke system that moves goods in and out of terminals. The less-than-truckload business has emerged from the pandemic's supply-chain chaos in better shape than the much larger truckload segment.
In the five years through 2022, a period in which trucking boomed, Yellow racked up over $ 200 million in losses, while Old Dominion Freight Line, also a less-than-truckload company with revenues similar to Yellow's, reported over $ 4 billion in profit over the same period.
Some analysts said that Yellow's elevated costs were partly a result of the wage demands of its unionized work force. And Darren Hawkins, the company's chief executive, blamed the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the main union at Yellow, for obstructing management's efforts to make the company more competitive.
"A company has the right to manage its own operations," he said in a news release, "but as we have experienced, I.B.T. leadership was able to halt our business plan, literally driving our company out of business, despite every effort to work with them."
The Teamsters said Monday that the company's employees had made financial sacrifices to try to save Yellow from its troubles. "They shamelessly pin their corporate incompetence on working people," Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters' general president, said in a news release.
Some analysts also point the finger at Yellow's senior executives.
Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting Group, which advises transport and logistical companies, said that Yellow's efforts to absorb big acquisitions over the last two decades had largely backfired and that the company took in less revenue per shipment than its rivals. Mr. Jindel said one cause was Yellow's apparent inability to determine when to charge more.
He noted that ArcBest, a less-than-truckload company that is also unionized, had remained an important hauler in recent years partly because it had higher-paying customers. ArcBest, he said, took in $ 529 per shipment in the first quarter, versus $ 339 at Yellow. Mr. Jindel said Yellow was a laggard "largely because of mismanagement."
Yellow did not respond on Monday to a request to speak about its management record.
One company hoping to pick up business from Yellow is Saia, a less-than-truckload company near Atlanta. The company's stock has more than doubled this year, and is up 25 percent just since the end of June. The S&P 500 stock index, by comparison, is up nearly 18 percent this year.
"We did well through the pandemic disruption, and this may be another opportunity for us to move through a disrupted market and continue to gain share and grow the profitability of the company," Frederick Holzgrefe, chief executive of Saia, said in an interview, referring to Yellow's collapse.
The trucking industry plays a critical role in the U.S. economy, transporting nearly three-fourths of all freight tonnage in the United States, according to the American Trucking Associations, a trade group. It is also prone to boom-and-bust cycles.
Strong demand for goods like patio furniture and home appliances during the pandemic turbocharged the industry. Shipping volumes and rates ballooned, and drivers left companies to set up their own businesses, sometimes buying trucks at wildly inflated prices.
The number of trucking firms surged by more than 50 percent from March 2020 to June 2023, and the number of trucks by nearly 20 percent, according to estimates by FTR, based on the most recently available data. But nearly all that growth took place at companies with one to five trucks, according to FTR.
"Unprecedented is almost not even strong enough a word," Mr. Vise said. "It was almost an unfathomable surge in the number of new carriers coming into the market."
As services supplanted goods in driving consumer spending, the small truckers' revenues declined, but many of their costs -- including wages and debt -- did not. That crimped profit margins and left some with big losses. Now, tens of thousands of the smaller operators are shutting down, according to FTR, though in many cases the truckers may go to work for larger companies.
"Trucking has been in a recession, all of trucking," said Bob Costello, chief economist for the American Trucking Associations. "Even though the macro economy has not."
Still, there is less pain for less-than-truckload companies, which, for the most part, have not suffered steep declines in shipping rates. That's because a small number of companies account for most of the shipments in the less-than-truckload business, analysts said.
"It's amazing how all these carriers have actually been very disciplined about holding the line on pricing," said Ari Rosa, an analyst at Credit Suisse who covers trucking companies.
The stress has been concentrated among truckload companies. Entering the truckload business is easier because it requires having just a truck, rather than a network of terminals. As a result, the business is also more volatile and prone to suffer when a boom ends. Leading truckload companies like Knight-Swift and J.B. Hunt have reported big declines in earnings, but their stocks have rallied in recent weeks.
It is not yet clear how drivers will fare as the industry seeks to find a new balance.
Many received raises during the pandemic after years of relatively sluggish pay gains. Weekly wages in long-distance trucking -- a good proxy for truck driver pay, according to economists -- were $ 1,283 in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. That works out to nearly $ 67,000 a year, about 25 percent higher than in June 2019, not adjusted for inflation.
Industry analysts say companies have been loath to let go of drivers because of how hard it was to attract and keep them during the boom. But that can push up costs for companies when revenues are sagging.
"In terms of driver retention, we're performing pretty well," said Mr. Holzgrefe, the Saia chief executive. "Of course, we're going to make sure we pay very competitively."

U.S. Adds 187,000 Jobs As Cooling Continues: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Employers added 187,000 workers in July, a slower pace than the recent norm, but "more sustainable," one economist said.
The U.S. economy continued to generate sturdy employment growth in July, but it showed definite signs of cooling alongside the Federal Reserve's battle to suppress inflation.
American employers added 187,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, experiencing 31 straight months of growth. The unemployment rate sank back to 3.5 percent, near a record low.
Revised figures for the prior two months modulated the economic picture slightly from an almost imperceptible slowdown to a clear deceleration after gains exceeding 200,000 had become the norm. Still, the report shows that most people who want to work can find jobs, keeping upward pressure on wages.
Average hourly earnings rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier, slightly more than expected, and enough to give workers more spending power even as prices keep going up.
"We are converging towards a more sustainable pace," said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at the consulting firm EY-Parthenon, noting that wages and the rate of hiring don't always move in tandem. "The labor market is rebalancing, but it's a gradual process, and that explains why we're still seeing some tightness."
Overall economic growth has remained vigorous in recent months, and it has become clearer that a marked downturn is remote, if not beyond the horizon entirely. Some Wall Street banks and even the Fed's staff economists in Washington have called off their recession forecasts for this year, betting that inflation can normalize without subjecting workers and businesses to much more pain.
That normalization is visible in a narrowing of employment growth, which a year ago spanned nearly all sectors. Now it appears mostly in health care, which added 63,000 jobs in July, about a third of the total. Leisure and hospitality, which is still digging out of its pandemic-era hole, slowed to 17,000 additional jobs.
Most other industries were flat to negative. Manufacturing, which quailed in the face of higher interest rates and a slowdown in goods consumption, has remained essentially level since the beginning of the year. So has transportation and warehousing.
But with layoffs remaining low while the number of total hours worked sank slightly, it appears that corporate leaders aren't cutting payrolls drastically even as business slows. The biggest category to shed jobs was temporary help services, which had surged in early 2022; employers typically trim their contingent labor when their staffing needs stabilize.
"For those who still believe that there may be a soft spot ahead, it's going to be manageable," said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board. "It's going to be short, it's going to be shallow, so they're not going to shed a bunch of workers."
That's what Stephen Bullock is thinking. He is the president of Power Curbers, a manufacturer in North Carolina that specializes in construction equipment used in building subdivisions. Business has calmed down since the building boom of 2021, when Mr. Bullock instituted a $ 2-an-hour raise for his hourly workers to help retain them and cushion the impact of rising prices. Now, he said, "we don't feel that pressure at all."
Still, Mr. Bullock isn't considering laying off any of his roughly 120 employees -- and he said he would try not to even if demand receded further.
"You don't want to lose people and have to go fill those positions when things get busy," he said. "So we will look for R-and-D projects, new machine development, maintenance -- anything we can do in a slowdown to keep our people busy and productive so we have the people we need in a pickup."
Late last year, with prices rising at their fastest pace in decades, analysts voiced stronger concerns that the Federal Reserve's aggressive regimen of interest rate increases would break pieces of the economy more quickly.
So far, however, each sign of weakness has seemed to find a counterbalance. Escalating interest rates deflated the tech industry, but workers who had been laid off quickly found jobs. Residential construction then slowed along with home sales, but there are signs of new momentum, and industrial construction has been buoyed by new federal funding.
The banking turmoil in March and April has tightened lending standards, but it did not metastasize into a crisis. Business investment has been fading, as borrowing has gotten more expensive, but consumer spending has picked up the slack -- even if some of it is going on credit cards.
Kermit Baker, the chief economist at the American Institute of Architects, says that while the group's billings index measuring new contracts for design firms has been wobbly for the better part of a year, he thinks the worst is over.
"I'm guessing when we look back on this period in a year from now, we'll say that this was a series of rolling recessions," Dr. Baker said. "There will be parts of the country that say, 'That was a pretty rocky time.' There will be other parts that say: 'Recession? What recession?"'
Through it all, employment has not just exceeded its 2019 level, but it has even approached the trajectory it might have been on had the pandemic not intervened. Helping it along: a labor force that defied predictions of permanent shrinkage.
Although the share of people over age 65 who are either working or looking for work is still lower than in February 2020, the participation rate for people in their prime working years -- ages 25 to 54 -- has risen 0.4 percentage points. At the same time, a renewed flow of immigrants has eased some of the most acute shortages.
Other factors may be clouding the employment picture this summer. The hottest July on record, for example, made it difficult to perform any work outside. At the very least, that could displace some employment until later in the year. The longer temperatures stay at extreme levels, the more damage they could do.
"Let's say construction is cut back a bit more than it otherwise would be, maybe people are working for fewer hours, it's pushing that activity to the fall," said Jim Rounds, a former state budget analyst who heads an economic consultancy in Arizona. "If it were over more months, that would be a bigger deal."
Labor strife has also disrupted hiring lately. Although an agreement between UPS and the Teamsters appears to have averted a strike that could have crippled package delivery nationwide, the walkout by actors in the Hollywood union SAG-AFTRA, which has roughly 160,000 members, could depress employment in the coming months.
Workers' greater leverage in a tight job market has resulted in substantial pay increases, which could keep wage growth elevated even as inflation subsides.
On Bloomberg Television on Friday, Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, noted that wages generally might continue rising as workers catch up to the cost of living, without being a cause for concern. Other economists have noted that if worker productivity improves, as it did this past quarter, wages can grow faster without fueling inflation.
The Fed has lots more data to digest before its next meeting in September, where it is broadly expected to hold rates steady as long as nothing greatly reaccelerates.
The coming months also feature new risks, including the resumption of student loan payments for tens of millions of borrowers in October, the debt overhang from vacant commercial office buildings and the rising tide of defaults on risky loans. Even if nothing collapses, companies may cut payrolls to maintain profit margins as consumers demand lower prices.
That's why most forecasters still expect meager monthly increases in employment -- or even declines -- toward the end of 2023, which may finally bring inflation back to the 2 percent rate that the Fed is looking for. But for now, most workers remain optimistic that if they lost their jobs, they wouldn't remain unemployed for long -- and they can afford to be choosy about the next one.
Nathan Beaumont, an operations supervisor in transportation and logistics, was laid off a week ago when the trucking company Yellow said it was shutting down. He had been planning to quit anyway, because the unstable schedule deprived him of time with his fiancée and friends, but he was glad to get two weeks of severance and then unemployment benefits -- and isn't too worried about finding another position.
Right now, he would prefer something that would lend a bit more stability.
"Over the last few years, it seems like every year and a half to two years, I've had to look for a new job," said Mr. Beaumont, who lives in a suburb of Minneapolis. "If I can find a place where I can stay for a good long time, I'll take that job."

Rich U.S. Leftist Linked to Web Of Global Chinese Propaganda: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The protest in London's bustling Chinatown brought together a variety of activist groups to oppose a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So it was peculiar when a street brawl broke out among mostly ethnic Chinese demonstrators.
Witnesses said the fight, in November 2021, started when men aligned with the event's organizers, including a group called No Cold War, attacked activists supporting the democracy movement in Hong Kong.
On the surface, No Cold War is a loose collective run mostly by American and British activists who say the West's rhetoric against China has distracted from issues like climate change and racial injustice.
In fact, a New York Times investigation found, it is part of a lavishly funded influence campaign that defends China and pushes its propaganda. At the center is a charismatic American millionaire, Neville Roy Singham, who is known as a socialist benefactor of far-left causes.
What is less known, and is hidden amid a tangle of nonprofit groups and shell companies, is that Mr. Singham works closely with the Chinese government media machine and is financing its propaganda worldwide.
From a think tank in Massachusetts to an event space in Manhattan, from a political party in South Africa to news organizations in India and Brazil, The Times tracked hundreds of millions of dollars to groups linked to Mr. Singham that mix progressive advocacy with Chinese government talking points.
Some, like No Cold War, popped up in recent years. Others, like the American antiwar group Code Pink, have morphed over time. Code Pink once criticized China's rights record but now defends its internment of the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, which human rights experts have labeled a crime against humanity.
These groups are funded through American nonprofits flush with at least $ 275 million in donations.
But Mr. Singham, 69, himself sits in Shanghai, where one outlet in his network is co-producing a YouTube show financed in part by the city's propaganda department. Two others are working with a Chinese university to "spread China's voice to the world." And last month, Mr. Singham joined a Communist Party workshop about promoting the party internationally.
Mr. Singham says he does not work at the direction of the Chinese government. But the line between him and the propaganda apparatus is so blurry that he shares office space -- and his groups share staff members -- with a company whose goal is to educate foreigners about "the miracles that China has created on the world stage."
Years of research have shown how disinformation, both homegrown and foreign-backed, influences mainstream conservative discourse. Mr. Singham's network shows what that process looks like on the left.
He and his allies are on the front line of what Communist Party officials call a "smokeless war." Under the rule of Xi Jinping, China has expanded state media operations, teamed up with overseas outlets and cultivated foreign influencers. The goal is to disguise propaganda as independent content.
Mr. Singham's groups have produced YouTube videos that, together, racked up millions of views. They also seek to influence real-world politics by meeting with congressional aides, training politicians in Africa, running candidates in South African elections and organizing protests like the one in London that erupted into violence.
The result is a seemingly organic bloom of far-left groups that echo Chinese government talking points, echo one another, and are echoed in turn by the Chinese state media.
Because the network is built on the back of American nonprofit groups, tax experts said, Mr. Singham may have been eligible for tax deductions for his donations.
The Times untangled the web of charities and shell companies using nonprofit and corporate filings, internal documents and interviews with over two dozen former employees of groups linked to Mr. Singham. Some groups, including No Cold War, do not seem to exist as legal entities but are tied to the network through domain registration records and shared organizers.
None of Mr. Singham's nonprofits have registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, as is required of groups that seek to influence public opinion on behalf of foreign powers. That usually applies to groups taking money or orders from foreign governments. Legal experts said Mr. Singham's network was an unusual case.
Most of the groups in Mr. Singham's network declined to answer questions from The Times. Three said they had never received money or instructions from a foreign government or political party.
Speculation about Mr. Singham first emerged on Twitter among self-described anti-fascists. Reports followed in the publication New Lines and the South African investigative outlet amaBhungane. The authorities in India raided a news organization tied to Mr. Singham during a crackdown on the press, accusing it of having ties to the Chinese government but offering no proof.
The Times investigation is the first to unravel the funding and document Mr. Singham's ties to Chinese propaganda interests.
Mr. Singham did not offer substantive answers to questions about those ties. He said he abided by the tax laws in countries where he was active.
"I categorically deny and repudiate any suggestion that I am a member of, work for, take orders from, or follow instructions of any political party or government or their representatives," he wrote in an email. "I am solely guided by my beliefs, which are my long-held personal views."
Indeed, his associates say Mr. Singham has long admired Maoism, the Communist ideology that gave rise to modern China. He praised Venezuela under the leftist president Hugo Chávez as a "phenomenally democratic place." And a decade before moving to China, he said the world could learn from its governing approach.
The son of a leftist academic, Archibald Singham, Mr. Singham is a longtime activist who founded the Chicago-based software consultancy Thoughtworks.
There, Mr. Singham came across as a charming showman who prided himself on creating an egalitarian corporate culture. He was unabashed about his politics. A former company technical director, Majdi Haroun, recalled Mr. Singham lecturing him on the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Mr. Haroun said employees sometimes jokingly called each other "comrade."
In 2017, Mr. Singham married Jodie Evans, a former Democratic political adviser and the co-founder of Code Pink. The wedding, in Jamaica, was a "Who's Who" of progressivism. Photos from the event show Amy Goodman, host of "Democracy Now!"; Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream; and V, the playwright formerly known as Eve Ensler, who wrote "The Vagina Monologues."
It was also a working event. The invitation described a panel discussion called "The Future of the Left."
Mr. Singham had a plan for that future. He had quietly funded left-wing causes while at Thoughtworks. But his activism was about to intensify. Six months after his wedding, he sold Thoughtworks to a private equity firm. A copy of the sale agreement put the price at $ 785 million.
"I decided that at my age and extreme privilege, the best thing I could do was to give away most of my money in my lifetime," he said in his statement.
The Network Takes Shape
While other moguls slapped their names on foundations, Mr. Singham sent his money through a system that concealed his giving.
At its center were four new nonprofits with dust-dry names like "United Community Fund" and "Justice and Education Fund." They have almost no real-world footprints, listing their addresses only as UPS store mailboxes in Illinois, Wisconsin and New York.
Because American nonprofit groups do not need to disclose individual donors, these four nonprofits worked like a financial geyser, throwing out a shower of money from an invisible source.
In their public filings, none list Mr. Singham as a board member or donor. "I do not control them," he said in his statement, "although I have been known to share my opinions."
In reality, Mr. Singham has close ties to all four.
The largest is run by Ms. Evans. The group's founding bylaws say that Mr. Singham can fire her and the rest of the board. They also require that the group dissolve after Mr. Singham's death.
The other three groups were founded by former Thoughtworks employees, according to interviews with other former Thoughtworks staff members and résumés posted online.
In his statement, Mr. Singham acknowledged giving his money to unnamed intermediaries that fit the description of these four UPS store nonprofits. And several groups that received donations from them have identified Mr. Singham as the source.
One of them is the Massachusetts-based think tank Tricontinental. Its executive director, Vijay Prashad, recounted Mr. Singham's financing in 2021. "A Marxist with a massive software company!" he wrote on Twitter.
Tricontinental produces videos and articles on socialist issues. Mr. Prashad did not answer questions about Mr. Singham, but said the organization followed the law. "We do not and have never received funds or instructions from any government or political party," he said in a statement.
From the UPS store nonprofits, millions of dollars flowed around the world. The Times tracked money to a South African political party, YouTube channels in the United States and nonprofits in Ghana and Zambia. In Brazil, records show, money flowed to a group that produces a publication, Brasil de Fato, that intersperses articles about land rights with praise for Xi Jinping.
In New Delhi, corporate filings show, Mr. Singham's network financed a news site, NewsClick, that sprinkled its coverage with Chinese government talking points. "China's history continues to inspire the working classes," one video said.
These groups operate in coordination. They have cross-posted articles and shared one another's content on social media hundreds of times. Many share staff members and office space. They organize events together and interview one another's representatives without disclosing their ties.
'Hijacked' in South Africa
Several times a year, activists and politicians from across Africa fly to South Africa for boot camps at the Nkrumah School, set in a popular safari area.
They come to learn to organize workers and left-wing movements. Once on campus, though, some attendees are surprised to find Chinese topics seeping into the curriculum.
At a recent session, reading packets said that the United States was waging a "hybrid war" against China by distorting information about Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Xinjiang region where Uyghurs were held in camps.
The packets praised Chinese loans, calling them "an opportunity for African states to construct genuine, and sovereign, development projects." No mention was made of China's role in a recent debt crisis in Zambia.
"They're being rounded up to be fed Chinese propaganda," said Cebelihle Mbuyisa, a former employee who helped prepare materials for the workshop. "Whole social movements on the African continent are being hijacked by what looks like a foreign policy instrument of the Chinese Communist Party."
Those who objected were shouted down or not invited back, four past attendees said.
U.S. tax records show that one of the UPS store nonprofits, the People's Support Foundation, donated at least $ 450,000 for training at the school. On Instagram, Ms. Evans described a photo of the grounds as "Roy's new place."
The $ 450,000 was just part of Mr. Singham's efforts in South Africa. In all, the foundation has sent $ 5.6 million to groups that run the school; a news organization; and the Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party, a fringe party launched ahead of the 2019 election.
Former party members said they were perplexed that, despite severe local unemployment and poverty, the party seemed interested in China. Mr. Singham, for example, urged them to attend an online lecture by a Chinese academic, Li Bo of Fudan University, an email shows.
After a party member called China's presence in Africa "a second colonization," leaders responded defensively in a WhatsApp group. "When it came to us questioning certain behaviors from the Chinese state, that was a no-no," said Lindiwe Mkhumbane, a former member.
In a statement, the party said its members have attended workshops on progressive issues but that it had never forced anyone to attend.
Mr. Singham also funded an online news start-up, New Frame, according to a recording obtained by The Times. One employee, Aragorn Eloff, said Mr. Singham interviewed him for a job.
The outlet hired talented reporters and paid them well. Readership was small, but the stated goal was "quality, not clicks."
Its former top editor has denied that New Frame had a pro-China slant. But a former reporter, Anna Majavu, said that an editor removed criticism of Chinese labor practices from a story on mining. "The resistance from the editor was purely political," she said.
And in June 2022, an editor, Darryl Accone, wrote a resignation letter criticizing New Frame's soft coverage of China and Russia. The "unavoidable conclusion," he wrote, "is that this is an ideological directive emanating from above and outside New Frame."
'Always Follow the Party'
Mr. Singham's office, adorned in red and yellow, sits on the 18th floor of Shanghai's swanky Times Square.
A visit shows that he is not alone.
He shares the office with a Chinese media company called Maku Group, which says its goal is to "tell China's story well," a term commonly used for foreign propaganda. In a Chinese-language job advertisement, Maku says it produces text, audio and videos for "global networks of popular media and progressive think tanks."
It can be hard to tell where Maku begins and Mr. Singham's groups end.
Nonprofit filings show that nearly $ 1.8 million flowed from one of the UPS store nonprofits to Maku Group. And in 2021, according to a Chinese-language news release, Maku and Tricontinental agreed to work with a Shanghai university to "tell China's story" in Chinese and English.
Maku's website shows young people gathering in Mr. Singham's office, facing a red banner that reads, in Chinese, "Always Follow the Party." Resting on a shelf is a plate depicting Xi Jinping.
Maku Group did not respond to a request to comment. After The Times began asking questions, its website went down for maintenance.
In 2020, Mr. Singham emailed his friends to introduce a newsletter, now called Dongsheng News, that covers China in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Drawing stories from the state media, it blends lighthearted news with bureaucratic official prose.
Dongsheng's editors, in China, come from Tricontinental, but its address leads to the People's Forum, a Manhattan event space also funded by Mr. Singham. Dongsheng "provides unique progressive coverage of China that has been sadly missing," Mr. Singham told friends.
His ties to the propaganda machine date back at least to 2019, when, corporate documents show, he started a consulting business with Chinese partners. Those partners are active in the propaganda apparatus, co-owning with the municipal government of Tongren a media company that promotes anti-poverty policies.
The small, southwest city of Tongren might seem a niche topic. But organizations in Mr. Singham's network have published at least a dozen items about peasants there.
Code Pink
Ms. Evans, 68, was once a Democratic insider who managed the 1992 presidential campaign of the California governor Jerry Brown.
After the 2001 terrorist attacks, she reinvented herself as an activist. She became known for pink peace-sign earrings and sit-ins that ended with her arrest.
She helped form Code Pink to protest the looming war in Iraq. The group became notorious for disrupting Capitol Hill hearings.
Ms. Evans has organized around progressive causes like climate change, gender and racism. Until a few years ago, she readily criticized China's authoritarian government.
"We demand China stop brutal repression of their women's human rights defenders," she wrote on Twitter in 2015. She later posted on Instagram a photo with the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei.
Since 2017, about a quarter of Code Pink's donations -- more than $ 1.4 million -- have come from two groups linked to Mr. Singham, nonprofit records show. The first was one of the UPS store nonprofits. The second was a charity that Goldman Sachs offers as a conduit for clients' giving, and that Mr. Singham has used in the past.
Ms. Evans now stridently supports China. She casts it as a defender of the oppressed and a model for economic growth without slavery or war. "If the U.S. crushes China," she said in 2021, it "would cut off hope for the human race and life on Earth."
She describes the Uyghurs as terrorists and defends their mass detention. "We have to do something," she said in 2021. In a recent YouTube video chat, she was asked if she had anything negative to say about China.
"I can't, for the life of me, think of anything," Ms. Evans responded. She ultimately had one complaint: She had trouble using China's phone-based payment apps.
Ms. Evans declined to answer questions about funding from her husband but said Code Pink had never taken money from any government. "I deny your suggestion that I follow the direction of any political party, my husband or any other government or their representatives," she said in a written statement. "I have always followed my values."
Few on the American political left would discuss the couple publicly, fearing lawsuits or harassment. Others said that criticism would undermine progressive causes. But Howie Hawkins, the 2020 Green Party presidential nominee, said he had soured on Code Pink and others in the Singham network that presented themselves as pro-labor but supported governments that suppressed workers. "To defend that, or excuse that, really pushes them outside what the left ought to be," he said.
Code Pink is not alone among left-wing groups in raising concerns about anti-Asian discrimination and tensions between Beijing and Washington.
But Code Pink goes further, defending the Chinese government's policies. In a 2021 video, a staff member compared Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators to the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 that year.
In June, Code Pink activists visited staff members on the House Select Committee on China unannounced. In the office of Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, activists denied evidence of forced labor in Xinjiang and said the congressman should visit and see how happy people were there, according to an aide.
"They are capitalizing on very legitimate concerns in order to push this pro-authoritarian narrative," said Brian Hioe, an editor with New Bloom, a progressive Taiwanese news site. "And their ideas end up circulating in a way that affects mainstream discourse."
Chinese state media accounts have retweeted people and organizations in Mr. Singham's network at least 122 times since February 2020, a Times analysis found, mostly accounts connected with No Cold War and Code Pink.
This May, Mr. Singham attended the opening of a media institute in Shanghai. Organizers distributed tote bags reading "Communications as solidarity."
A photo shows Mr. Singham sitting up front, next to Yu Yunquan, an official from a publishing group under the Communist Party's powerful Central Committee.
Just last month, Mr. Singham attended a Chinese Communist Party propaganda forum. In a photo, taken during a breakout session on how to promote the party abroad, Mr. Singham is seen jotting in a notebook adorned with a red hammer and sickle.

Amazon Posts 11% Rise in Revenue as Growth Improves: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The retailer also swung to a profit in the second quarter.
All that cost-cutting at Amazon might be paying off. The company isn't back to the torrid growth of bygone days but managed to beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday.
Revenue in the second quarter rose 11 percent to $ 134.4 billion, the retailer said, better than the 9 percent it was achieving recently. That was about $ 3 billion more than analysts had been forecasting.
Net income was 65 cents a share versus expectations of 35 cents. Last year, the company lost 20 cents a share in the quarter because of a slump in the value of its investment in Rivian, the electric truck maker.
Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said in a conference call that the results were helped by reconfiguring the company's delivery network to put merchandise closer to buyers.
"When shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which costs less in transportation, get there faster and is better for the environment," he said. "There's a lot of goodness in that equation."
Fulfillment costs, which are the price of getting the goods from the warehouse to the customer's house, rose only 5 percent in the quarter.
Amazon shares rose more than 10 percent after the earnings were announced. Traders also liked that the company estimated third-quarter revenue would increase 9 to 13 percent and operating income would double. The third quarter includes special annual sale days that usually boost revenue.
July signified two years since Mr. Jassy took over as chief executive from Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder. Mr. Jassy's stewardship so far has been a period of retrenchment. Amazon flourished during the pandemic, supplying necessities and diversions to millions of suddenly grounded families, and the retailer made the reasonable assumption that the boom would last.
It didn't. There were layoffs and cutbacks last winter, a time when many big tech companies consolidated swollen operations. The stock fell sharply in 2022 after years of growth. It has since recovered much of the loss but is still below its peak.
Some analysts have worried that Amazon's recent desire to keep expenses down clashes with its longstanding obsession over making customers happy.
Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson, wrote a note last week to investors about several disappointments he had experienced with Amazon, including no longer being able to have a defective product picked up without cost by UPS. Now, he wrote, there is a $ 7.99 fee.
"In our view, Amazon is playing a 'game of chicken' and banking on other e-commerce companies not to offer a superior service, instead of its historical approach of working backwards with a customer-obsessed approach," Mr. Forte wrote.
One of Mr. Bezos' last major actions before his departure was to add "Strive to be Earth's best employer" to the company's leadership principles. "Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered?" the principle states.
The first Amazon union was formed at a warehouse in Staten Island last year, but the company has refused to negotiate with it and is challenging its validity. The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Amazon in July for refusing to bargain. Meanwhile, employees' return to the office post-pandemic has been unusually contentious for the company.
Employment appears to have stabilized. Slightly fewer than 1.5 million people work for the company, down 4 percent from a year ago and flat from the prior quarter.
Amazon is so large, with over half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, that it is difficult to move the needle much. In earlier years, the retail division grew like gangbusters. Then the AWS cloud division provided the supercharged growth, and finally advertising pushed the numbers.
It's hard to see where the next phase of growth will come from. AWS is growing at about a 12 percent annual rate, while online stores were up 4 percent and advertising 22 percent.
Most new programs, like this week's roll out of grocery service for customers who are not Prime club members, are incremental. Non-Prime members will pay higher delivery fees.
If the second quarter at Amazon was relatively quiet, the current quarter is likely to produce more in the way of headlines. The Federal Trade Commission is widely expected to file a lawsuit against the company accusing it of violating antitrust laws. A resolution could be years away.

Legacy Admissions Mean More Than Fund-Raising: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Schools have financial incentives to favor the relatives of alumni.
If colleges do away with legacy admissions, will it cost them financially? That's the big question being whispered among university provosts and trustees across the country as the practice of giving children of alumni an edge in admissions comes under fire and there is increasing pressure to end it.
Just this week, a study showed that children of alumni who applied to top schools were on average four times as likely to be admitted as applicants with the same test scores.
President Biden has said giving preference to such candidates, a practice known as legacy admissions, expands "privilege instead of opportunity." And on Tuesday, the Education Department announced a civil rights inquiry into Harvard's legacy admissions practices after three liberal groups said it discriminated against Black, Hispanic and Asian American applicants.
And when the Supreme Court decided last month to limit affirmative action, a concurring opinion from Justice Neil Gorsuch included a direct attack on legacy admissions, calling it a form of affirmative action for the elite.
Wesleyan University, a liberal arts college in Connecticut, announced two weeks ago that it was ending legacy admissions. Other schools, including Amherst, Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon, have also dropped programs that favor alumni. However, many have not -- at least not yet.
Many elite schools say legacy admissions are important for maintaining relationships with alumni, which can help universities raise money that is then available for financial aid to needy students. In a June 2018 legal filing in the case that led to the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision, Harvard argued that "there would be substantial costs" to ending legacy admissions.
But how substantial? The answer is about more than fund-raising.
Legacy students may donate more. In a study published last year in the American Sociological Review, researchers looked at 16 years of admissions data from a school described as "representative of elite U.S. institutions." They found that legacy students were more likely to have wealthy parents and come from families flagged as big donors. Such students also tended to donate more after graduating than other students, even though both groups earned similar incomes.
But less than a quarter of donations come directly from alumni, according to an estimate by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. "No fund-raising shop is going to have to make up half of their gift revenue if there's a change in the admission office about legacy admissions," said Mickey Munley, a fund-raising consultant for schools and a former vice president of alumni relations at a private liberal arts college in Iowa. "It's overplayed." In addition, donations account for a small portion of revenue at extremely selective schools. At Wesleyan, donations make up just 3 percent of operating revenue.
Legacy status may also work as a proxy for financial need. In the American Sociological Review study, legacy students were about half as likely to apply for financial aid as admitted students who weren't related to alumni. In other words, these students are more likely to be able to pay full tuition without help from the university. "It's a way to circumvent need-blind policies," said Richard D. Kahlenberg, an education expert and a nonresident scholar at Georgetown University. "You can be fairly confident in many cases that those students will be able to pay the full tuition and not require financial aid."
And admitting relatives of alumni may help protect prestige. Relatives of alumni were more likely to attend the school if they were admitted, the same study found. That's especially a boon for schools that are not among the most competitive, said Ken Anselment, a former admissions executive at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. If more students accept offers, colleges and universities can admit fewer students. That helps lower their acceptance rate. "Selectivity is a shortcut of quality for a lot of people," Mr. Anselment said.
Is there another way? In a survey by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, 217 schools reported data about the number and total amount of gifts they received last year. About 81 percent of the total came from gifts of $ 1 million or more. "There is an issue that schools are confronting where they have a smaller donor base giving larger gifts, and so they're more worried about the bigger gifts," Mr. Munley said. Mr. Kahlenberg said there was a more direct way that universities could raise that money: "I think it would be much more honest to just simply open the bidding for anyone," he said. "Set aside a certain number of seats, and then put them up to the highest bidder." Though, he added, "I haven't had any takers yet." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Thermometers worldwide hit new highs. July is on track to be the warmest month on record, according to the European Union's climate monitor. And the worst isn't over yet: Scientists worry that human-generated carbon emissions and the weather phenomenon known as El Niño may keep temperatures up for years.
The Twitter brand is flying away. Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's chief executive, said rebranding the company as X was a step toward creating a so-called everything app, which would let users post content, send money and do much more. Mr. Musk is the latest Western tech mogul to try to copy Chinese super-apps like WeChat, but such efforts failed in the past.
UPS delivers a deal with its drivers' union. The delivery giant reached a tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters days before the current labor contract expires on Tuesday. Drivers had voted to authorize a strike if a pact wasn't reached, which could have had dire consequences for the American economy: UPS accounts for about a quarter of all packages shipped daily in the United States.
Tech giants power along. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Meta, the owner of Facebook, showed rebounds in their core digital advertising businesses, recovering from steep drops last year.
Talk of a 'soft landing' is ramping up
With inflation still soaring and corporate profits looking shaky, business leaders were hardly a confident bunch in the first half of the year.
Today, the outlook is rosier, chief executives increasingly say. And that optimism is reflected in a phrase that has become one of their favorites: "soft landing."
Executives at S&P 500 firms have uttered the words with more frequency on earnings calls, suggesting a growing belief that the economy is likely to avoid a recession.
Chris Nassetta, the chief executive of Hilton, used those words on Thursday to tell investors that the boom in travel spending was likely to tail off after this summer, but that he was still feeling upbeat about the strength of the consumer.
"The consensus view right now, broadly, is that it's going to slow down, but it's more of a soft landing," he said. "We have reasonable sightlines now into the third quarter, which we feel very good about."
David Solomon, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, saw reason for optimism back in February when he said the economy was probably headed for "a softer landing." That call is looking prescient after this week's surprisingly strong G.D.P. reading.
Warning: Just because people repeat the phrase, it doesn't mean it's fated to come true.
The world is your conference room
Members of the DealBook team live in New York, Washington, Chicago, London and Rome, and we most often meet virtually. So we wondered: Is it important to be at a desk? In the postpandemic professional scene, just how miffed or forgiving should we be about video calls from a cab or airport security? Experts weighed in.
The goal of good etiquette is to make people comfortable, so there's a range of appropriate behavior, said Lizzie Post of the Emily Post Institute, an author and a great-great-granddaughter of the renowned etiquette expert Emily Post. "You always want to be present and focused," she said. That means having the camera on, Ms. Post said. But location is flexible. During the pandemic, when movement was restricted and many were sharing close quarters, Ms. Post saw a lot of people meeting in parked cars, she said. Still, she advised, "We want to be careful about how we make these choices."
"Not everyone is looking for their lives to be so casual," Ms. Post cautioned. Consider who is meeting, the possible impact on others and just how presentable you need to appear. Is it a client? Are you trying to close a deal? It's not necessarily a status flex to take a call from any particular place, or a sign of disrespect, especially if urgency outweighs formality, she said. But it should be noted that Ms. Post spoke via video from her office, preferring to reschedule when a glitch created a risk that she would be on the go as she illuminated mobile etiquette. "If I did the interview in the car, I would have wanted to ask you about it first," she said. "The key is to check in."
Presence is everything. "To me, the real conversation is not about location but expectations," said Steven Rogelberg, a University of South Carolina business school professor and the author of "The Surprising Science of Meetings." In a phone interview that Rogelberg had warned might come from his car, the meeting expert argued for a liberated approach. Leaders should demonstrate total presence and make meetings relevant to attendees, and they should demand the same from others without dictating specifics, he said.
"Wherever you want to do the meeting is fine as long as you can focus and commit," he said, adding, "Of course it's absolutely true that having meetings in cabs or cafes can make those things much harder."

Heat Is Costing the U.S. Economy Billions in Lost Productivity

Full text: Enlarge this image.
As much of the United States swelters under record heat, Amazon drivers and warehouse workers have gone on strike in part to protest working conditions that can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
On triple-digit days in Orlando, Florida, utility crews are postponing checks for gas leaks, since digging outdoors dressed in heavy safety gear could endanger their lives. Even in Michigan, on the nation’s northern border, construction crews are working shortened days because of heat.
Now that climate change has raised Earth’s temperatures to the highest levels in recorded history, with projections showing that they will only climb higher, new research shows the impact of heat on workers is spreading across the economy and lowering productivity.
Extreme heat is regularly affecting workers beyond expected industries such as agriculture and construction. Sizzling temperatures are causing problems for those who work in factories, warehouses and restaurants and also for employees of airlines and telecommunications firms, delivery services and energy companies. Even home health aides are running into trouble.
“We’ve known for a very long time that human beings are very sensitive to temperature, and that their performance declines dramatically when exposed to heat, but what we haven’t known until very recently is whether and how those lab responses meaningfully extrapolate to the real-world economy,” said R. Jisung Park, an environmental and labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania. “And what we are learning is that hotter temperatures appear to muck up the gears of the economy in many more ways than we would have expected.”
A study published in June on the effects of temperature on productivity concludes that although extreme heat harms agriculture, its impact is greater on industrial and other sectors of the economy, in part because they are more labor-intensive. It finds that heat increases absenteeism and reduces work hours, and concludes that as the planet continues to warm, those losses will increase.
The cost is high. In 2021, more than 2.5 billion hours of labor in the U.S. agriculture, construction, manufacturing and service sectors were lost to heat exposure, according to data compiled by The Lancet. Another report found that in 2020, the loss of labor as a result of heat exposure cost the economy about $100 billion, a figure projected to grow to $500 billion annually by 2050.
Other research found that as the mercury reaches 90 degrees, productivity slumps by about 25%, and when it goes past 100 degrees, productivity drops off by 70%.
And the effects are unequally distributed: In poor counties, workers lose as much as 5% of their pay with each hot day, researchers have found. In wealthy counties, the loss is less than 1%.
Of the many economic costs of climate change — dying crops, spiking insurance rates, flooded properties — the loss of productivity caused by heat is emerging as one of the biggest, experts say.
“We know that the impacts of climate change are costing the economy,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center and a former global executive for environmental and social risk at Bank of America. “The losses associated with people being hot at work, and the slowdowns and mistakes people make as a result are a huge part.”
Still, there are no national regulations to protect workers from extreme heat. In 2021, the Biden administration announced that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would propose the first rule designed to protect workers from heat exposure. But two years later, the agency still has not released a draft of the proposed regulation.
Seven states have some form of labor protections dealing with heat, but there has been a push to roll them back in some places. In June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law that eliminated rules set by municipalities that mandated water breaks for construction workers, even though Texas leads all states in terms of lost productivity linked to heat, according to an analysis of federal data conducted by Vivid Economics.
Business groups are opposed to a national standard, saying it would be too expensive because it would probably require rest, water and shade breaks and possibly the installation of air conditioning.
“OSHA should take care not to impose further regulatory burdens that make it more difficult for small businesses to grow their businesses and create jobs,” David Addington, vice president of the National Federation of Independent Business, wrote in response to OSHA’s plan to write a regulation.
Marc Freedman, vice president of employment policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, “I don’t think anyone is dismissing the hazard of overexposure to heat.” But, he said, “is an OSHA standard the right way to do it? A lot of employers are already taking measures, and the question will be: What more do they have to do?”
The National Beef slaughterhouse in Dodge City, Kansas, where temperatures are expected to hover above 100 degrees for the next week, is cooled by fans, not air conditioning.
Workers wear heavy protective aprons and helmets and use water vats and hoses heated to 180 degrees to sanitize their equipment. It has always been hot work.
But this year is different, said one worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. The heat inside the slaughterhouse is intense, drenching employees in sweat and making it hard to get through a shift, the worker said.
National Beef did not respond to emails or telephone calls requesting comment.
Martin Rosas, a union representative for meatpacking and food processing workers in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, said sweltering conditions present a risk for food contamination. After workers skin a hide, they need to ensure that debris doesn’t get on the meat or carcass. “But when it’s extremely hot, and their safety glasses fog up, their vision is impaired and they are exhausted, they can’t even see what they’re doing,” Rosas said.
Almost 200 employees out of roughly 2,500 have quit at the Dodge City National Beef plant since May, Rosas said. That’s about 10% higher than usual for that time period, he said.
But even some workers in air-conditioned settings are getting too hot. McDonald’s workers in Los Angeles walked off the job this summer as the air-conditioned kitchens were overwhelmed by the sweltering heat outside.
“There is an air conditioner in every part of the store, but the thermostat in the kitchen still showed it was over 100 degrees,” said Maria Rodriguez, who has worked at the same McDonald's on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles for 20 years but walked out July 21, sacrificing a day of pay. “It’s been hot before, but never like this summer. I felt terrible — like I could pass out or faint at any moment.”
Nicole Enearu, owner of the store, said in a statement, “We understand that there’s an uncomfortable heat wave in LA, which is why we’re even more focused on ensuring the safety of our employees inside our restaurants. Our air conditioning is functioning properly at this location.”
Tony Hedgepeth, a home health aide in Richmond, Virginia, cares for a client whose home thermostat is typically set at about 82 degrees. Last week, the temperature inside was near 94 degrees.
Any heat is a challenge in Hedgepeth’s job. “Bathing, cooking, lifting and moving him, cleaning him,” he said. “It’s all physical. It’s a lot of sweat.”
Warehouse workers across the country are also feeling the heat. Sersie Cobb, a forklift driver who stocks boxes of pasta in a warehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, said the stifling heat can make it difficult to breathe. “Sometimes I get dizzy and start seeing dots,” Cobb said. “My vision starts to go black. I stop work immediately when that happens. Two times this summer I’ve had heart palpitations from the heat, and left work early to go to the ER.”
In Southern California, a group of 84 striking Amazon delivery workers say that one of their priorities is getting the company to make it safe to work in extreme heat. Last month, unionized UPS workers won a victory when the company agreed to install air conditioning in delivery trucks.
“Heat has played a tremendous role — it was one of the major issues in the negotiations,” said Carthy Boston, a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters representing UPS drivers in Washington, D.C. “Those trucks are hotboxes.”
Many factories were built decades ago for a different climate and are not air-conditioned. A study on the effects of extreme temperatures on the productivity of auto plants in the United States found that a week with six or more days of heat exceeding 90 degrees cuts production by an average of 8%.
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Navistar is installing a $19 million air conditioning system at its IC Bus factory, which produces many of America’s school buses. Temperatures on the floor can reach 99 degrees. Currently, the plant is only cooled by overhead fans that swirl high above the assembly line.
Shane Anderson, the company’s interim manager, said air conditioning is expected to cost about $183 per hour, or between $275,000 and $500,000 per year — but the company believes it will boost worker productivity.
Other employers are also adapting.
Brad Maurer, vice president of Leidal and Hart, which builds stadiums, hospitals and factories in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, said managers now bring in pallets of bottled water, which they didn’t used to do, at a cost to the company of a few thousand dollars per month.
Rising heat around Detroit recently caused his employees to stop working three hours early on a Ford Motors facility for several days in a row — a pattern emerging throughout his company’s work sites.
“It means costs go up, production goes down, we may not meet schedules, and guys and women don’t get paychecks,” Maurer said.
Labor experts say that as employers adapt to the new reality of the changing climate, they will have to pay one way or the other.
“The truth is that the changes required probably will be very costly, and they will get passed on to employers and consumers,” said David Michaels, who served as assistant secretary of labor at OSHA during the Obama administration and is now a professor at the George Washington School of Public Health. “But if we don’t want these workers to get killed, we will have to pay that cost.”

Full text: An unlikely source of baby photos, a sharp jab to the ribs and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Doctors Hospital
Dear Diary:
It was 1980. I had just started at Doctors Hospital on the East Side as a young attending plastic surgeon. I was operating on my first case when Miss Bodine entered the room.
"Is this your first time at Doctors Hospital?" she asked.
"No, Miss Bodine," I said. "Actually, I was born here."
"Oh, my," she said. "Were are you a preemie?"
I thought it was a strange question, but I said I had been born prematurely and kept in the hospital before going home.
I finished the surgery, and she was very helpful.
When I returned the next week, Miss Bodine entered the room with a large manila envelope.
"This is for you," she said.
I opened the envelope and found three pictures of me in an incubator on the day I was born, each with my name written below along with my date of birth.
Miss Bodine, it turned out, had been the head nurse of what was later called the neonatal intensive care unit and had maintained albums with pictures of every newborn kept there.
-- John E. Sherman
Sharp Jab
Dear Diary:
On a sweltering Saturday in summer 1995, I was 25, hung over and waiting for the No. 1 train at 116th Street with a friend. We were on our way to Penn Station to pick up another friend.
When the train arrived, I stepped inside and stopped immediately so that I could lean against the door when it closed. A few moments later, I felt a sharp jab to my ribs and heard a stern, "Step aside!"
I apologized sheepishly.
The elbow jabber turned and looked at me. She was a petite woman about my age, and something happened when our eyes met.
"You're not from around here, are you?" she said.
"No," I said, feeling myself blush. "I just moved here from upstate."
"You apologized," she said, smiling. "That's how I knew."
"I just finished a parks restoration job upstate," she continued. "Where did you live?"
By the time we got to Penn Station, I had her phone number and we had arranged to meet with a group of her friends and mine at an East Village bar that night.
We talked until 4 a.m., then went for falafels at Mamoun's on St. Marks until the sun came up. June 27 was our 25th wedding anniversary.
-- John Diefendorf
Waiting Around
Dear Diary:
Life is slow these days. I check my lobby for packages scheduled to arrive, even though UPS sends me alerts and delivers to my door.
Today, hearing a distant buzzer, I went down just in case. No package, but a woman carrying groceries was waiting outside. The latch stuck as I opened the door.
"Buzzer not working?" she asked.
"It worked earlier today," I said.
We stepped over to the elevator. Inside was my next-door neighbor, an older woman named Oneida. She had come down to meet her helper. She lit up when she saw us.
She sometimes pops into the hall in her robe and slippers if I'm singing outside my door. She blows me kisses, and I usually get a hug.
Minutes later, I was back upstairs when my doorbell rang. I sprang up to get my package. At the door was Oneida, smiling and holding an origami box I had made for her.
I motioned for her to lift the lid. Then I blew a kiss into the box with both hands and motioned for her to close it. She hugged me as we parted.
-- Paul Klenk
Helping Hands
Dear Diary:
It was about 25 years ago after a major winter storm that had mostly shut the city down. Despite the bad weather, my boss still expected me to get in for work.
Off I went, climbing the snowy mounds piled up at every intersection in Chelsea. I entered the subway, got on the train and then exited at 42nd Street near Bryant Park.
After coming up the stairs, I found my myself standing at the base of a Matterhorn of snow left behind by the plows clearing Fifth Avenue.
I was trying to figure out what I was going to do when two city workers wearing high boots and snowsuits appeared.
Without a word, they stood on either side of me. Each gently took an arm and lifted me across the snowy mound so I could cross the street.
I clocked into work on time.
-- Miriam Zellnik
'Lobby, Please'
Dear Diary:
I was leaving my apartment to walk the dog. When I got on the elevator, there was a man there who asked where I was headed and motioned toward the buttons.
"Lobby, please," I said.
Somewhat confused after noticing that none of the other buttons were lit up, I asked where he was headed.
"I'm the elevator inspector," he said. "I'll be here a while."

UPS Reaches Agreement With Union To Raise Pay: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: United Parcel Service faced a potential walkout by more than 325,000 union members after their five-year contract expires next week.
United Parcel Service announced Tuesday that it had reached a tentative deal on a five-year contract with the union representing more than 325,000 of its U.S. workers, a key step in averting a potential strike.
The union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, reported in June that its UPS members had voted to authorize a walkout after the expiration of the current agreement on Aug. 1, with 97 percent of those who took part in the vote endorsing the move.
UPS handles about one-quarter of the tens of millions of packages that are shipped daily in the United States, and the strike prospect has threatened to dent economic activity, particularly the e-commerce industry.
Representatives from more than 150 Teamster locals will meet on Monday to review the agreement, and rank-and-file members will vote on it from Aug. 3 to Aug. 22, according to the union.
Negotiations had broken down in early July, largely over the issue of part-time pay, before resuming Tuesday morning.
"We demanded the best contract in the history of UPS, and we got it," the Teamsters president, Sean M. O'Brien, said in a statement. "UPS has put $ 30 billion in new money on the table as a direct result of these negotiations."
The company said it could not comment on the dollar value of the deal ahead of its second-quarter earnings call in early August.
The Teamsters said that under the tentative agreement, current full- and part-time UPS employees represented by the union would receive a $ 2.75-an-hour raise this year, and $ 7.50 an hour in raises over the course of the contract.
The minimum pay for part-timers will rise to $ 21 an hour -- far above the current minimum starting pay of $ 16.20 -- and the top rate for full-time delivery drivers will rise to $ 49 an hour. Full-time drivers currently make $ 42 an hour on average after four years.
The company has also pledged to create 7,500 new full-time union jobs and to fill 22,500 open positions, for which part-time workers will be eligible. The company has said that part-time workers are essential to navigating bursts of activity over the course of a day and during busy months, and that many part-timers graduate to full-time jobs.
"Together we reached a win-win-win agreement on the issues that are important to Teamsters leadership, our employees and to UPS and our customers," Carol Tomé, the company's chief executive, said in a statement. "This agreement continues to reward UPS's full- and part-time employees with industry-leading pay and benefits while retaining the flexibility we need to stay competitive."
The union had cited the company's strong pandemic-era performance, with net adjusted income up more than 70 percent last year from 2019, as a reason that workers deserved substantial raises.
It had especially emphasized the need to improve pay for part-timers, who account for more than half the U.S. employees represented by the Teamsters, and who the union said earn "near-minimum wage" in many areas.
The path to the agreement appeared to be paved weeks ago after the two sides resolved what was arguably their most contentious issue, a new class of worker created under the previous contract.
UPS had said the arrangement was intended to allow workers to take on dual roles, like sorting packages some days and driving on other days, especially Saturdays, as a way to keep up with growing demand for weekend delivery.
But the Teamsters said that the hybrid idea was never actually carried out, and that in practice the new category of workers drove full time Tuesday through Saturday, only for less pay than other drivers. The company said that, under the previous contract, the Saturday drivers made about 87 percent of the base pay of other drivers and that some workers did work in a dual role.
Under the tentative agreement, the lower-paid category of drivers will be eliminated, and workers who drive Tuesday through Saturday will be converted to regular full-time drivers.
The deal also stipulates that no driver will be required to work an unscheduled sixth day in a week, which drivers had at times been forced to do under the existing contract to keep up with Saturday demand.
The two sides also agreed on several key noneconomic issues, such as heat safety. Under the proposed deal, new trucks must have air-conditioning beginning in January, while existing trucks will be outfitted with additional fans and venting.
Whether it passes will partly be a political test for Mr. O'Brien, who was elected to head the Teamsters in 2021 while regularly criticizing his predecessor, James P. Hoffa, as being too accommodating toward employers and toward UPS in particular.
Mr. O'Brien argued that Mr. Hoffa had effectively forced UPS workers to accept a deeply flawed contract in 2018, even after they voted it down, and accused his Hoffa-backed rival of being reluctant to strike against the company.
Since taking over as president last year, he has frequently said the union would be aggressive in pressuring UPS and suggested on several occasions that a strike was likely.
A few days before the agreement on eliminating the hybrid worker position, Mr. O'Brien said in a statement that the Teamsters were walking away from the table over an "appalling counterproposal" and that a strike "now appears inevitable."
The company sought to reassure customers and the public that a deal would be consummated despite the occasionally heated pronouncements.
On an earnings call in April, the UPS chief executive, Ms. Tomé, said that the two sides were aligned on many key issues and that outsiders should not be distracted by the "great deal of noise" that was likely to arise in the run-up to a deal.
The deal, if ratified, removes a serious threat to the U.S. economy. Economists say a strike by UPS employees would have made it harder for businesses to ship goods on time, and the resulting restrictions in supply chains would probably have stoked inflation just as it had shown signs of easing.
"It would have been devastating to the economy, just given the size and scale of UPS," said Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist Advisory Services. "You can't just pull out a player that big without causing disruption and prices to go up."
A 10-day UPS strike would cost the U.S. economy about $ 7 billion, according to an estimate from the Anderson Economic Group.
Small businesses were most at risk from a strike as UPS might be their sole or primary shipping provider, meaning they would have to scramble for alternatives. Large retailers tend to have more diversified delivery providers and are more likely to have contingency plans to soften the blow.
Mr. O'Brien had explicitly asked President Biden, who has called himself "the most pro-labor union president," not to get involved in the negotiations. A group of over two dozen Democratic senators also pledged not to intervene.
The Biden administration helped broker a deal that headed off a freight rail strike last year. Many union members involved in that dispute saw the deal as leaning too heavily in favor of the major rail carriers.
In 1997, about 185,000 UPS workers staged a strike for 15 days. That time, the company reported that the strike cost it more than $ 600 million. But the last strike happened when e-commerce was in its infancy. UPS has benefited from the e-commerce boom: In 2022 it reported more than $ 100 billion in revenue, compared with $ 31 billion in 2002.

Market Rises as Earnings Buoy Wall Street: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street strengthened Tuesday after more companies reported fatter profits for the spring than expected.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent, its highest close since early April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6 percent.
General Electric helped lead the market with a 6.3 percent rally after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also raised its forecasts for full-year revenue and profits.
Another industrial giant, 3M, rose 5.3 percent after the maker of Scotch-Brite and Post-it raised its forecast for profits for the full year thanks in part to cost-cutting efforts. Shares of the home builder PulteGroup climbed 6.2 percent after it reported stronger profit for the spring than expected.
On the losing side of Wall Street were airline stocks, led by Alaska Air Group. It fell 9.7 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts said investors may have been disappointed with its financial forecasts for the current quarter.
Raytheon Technologies tumbled 10.2 percent after saying accelerated removals and inspections are needed for some of its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines to look for a rare condition in powder metal. That pushed the company to lower its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year, though it also reported stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected.
This week is a busy one for earnings reports, and roughly 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 are on the schedule. The majority have topped analysts' expectations so far this reporting season, as is usually the case.
Two of Wall Street's most influential stocks reported their results after trading closed for the day, Microsoft and Alphabet. They're two of the seven stocks behind the majority of the S&P 500's nearly 16 percent gain through the first half of the year.
That "Magnificent 7" will need to deliver strong results to justify their huge gains for the year so far, as their stocks soared on expectations they'll continue to deliver strong growth. Both Alphabet and Microsoft are up more than 38 percent for the year so far.
UPS swung between gains and losses after reaching a tentative deal with 340,000 unionized workers to raise pay, which potentially averts a strike. UPS ended the day down 1.9 percent.
This week's other highlight for Wall Street also got underway Tuesday: the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest rates.
The wide expectation is for the Fed on Wednesday to announce another increase to interest rates, as it tries to wrestle high inflation under control. That would take the federal funds rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent, its highest level in two decades and up from virtually zero early last year.
High rates grind down on inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks and other investments. The hope among traders is Wednesday's move will be the final increase of this cycle because inflation has been cooling since last summer.
Such hopes, along with rising belief that the economy can avoid a long-predicted recession, have helped stocks rally strongly this year. The job market has remained remarkably solid, which has allowed American households to keep spending and propping up the economy. A report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers rose by more than economists expected.
But many on Wall Street warn the Fed is unlikely to give any signals on Wednesday that it's done raising rates. Inflation is still high, even if it has moderated somewhat, and the economy may have to "yield to a long but shallow recession if the Fed is to return inflation to its 2 percent target," according to Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities.

The union had cited the company’s strong pandemic-era performance, with net adjusted income up more than 70% last year from 2019, as a reason that workers deserved substantial raises.
It had especially emphasized the need to improve pay for part-timers, who account for more than half the U.S. employees represented by the Teamsters, and who the union said earn “near-minimum wage” in many areas.
The path to the agreement appeared to be paved weeks ago after the two sides resolved what was arguably their most contentious issue, a new class of worker created under the previous contract.
UPS had said the arrangement was intended to allow workers to take on dual roles, like sorting packages some days and driving on other days, especially Saturdays, as a way to keep up with growing demand for weekend delivery.
But the Teamsters said the hybrid idea was never actually carried out, and that in practice the new category of workers drove full time Tuesday through Saturday, only for less pay than other drivers. The company said that, under the previous contract, the Saturday drivers made about 87% of the base-pay of other drivers and that some workers did work in a dual role.
Under the tentative agreement, the lower-paid category of drivers will be eliminated, and workers who drive Tuesday through Saturday will be converted to regular full-time drivers.
The deal also stipulates that no driver would be required to work an unscheduled sixth day in a week, which drivers had at times been forced to do under the existing contract to keep up with Saturday demand.
The two sides also agreed on several key noneconomic issues, such as heat safety. Under the proposed deal, new trucks must have air conditioning beginning in January, while existing trucks will be outfitted with additional fans and venting.
Whether it passes will partly be a political test for O’Brien, who was elected to head the Teamsters in 2021 while regularly criticizing his predecessor, James P. Hoffa, as being too accommodating toward employers and toward UPS in particular.
O’Brien argued that Hoffa had effectively forced UPS workers to accept a deeply flawed contract in 2018, even after they voted it down, and accused his Hoffa-backed rival of being reluctant to strike against the company.
Since taking over as president last year, he has frequently said the union would be aggressive in pressuring UPS and suggested on several occasions that a strike was likely.
A few days before the agreement on eliminating the hybrid worker position, O’Brien said in a statement that the Teamsters were walking away from the table over an “appalling counterproposal” and that a strike “now appears inevitable.”
The company sought to reassure customers and the public that a deal would be consummated despite the occasionally heated pronouncements.
On an earnings call in April, Tomé said the two sides were aligned on many key issues and that outsiders should not be distracted by the “great deal of noise” that was likely to arise in the run-up to a deal.
The deal, if ratified, removes a serious threat to the U.S. economy. Economists say a strike by UPS employees would have made it harder for businesses to ship goods on time, and the resulting restrictions in supply chains would probably have stoked inflation just as it had shown signs of easing.
“It would have been devastating to the economy, just given the size and scale of UPS,” said Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist Advisory Services. “You can’t just pull out a player that big without causing disruption and prices to go up.”
A 10-day UPS strike would cost the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to an estimate from the Anderson Economic Group.
Small businesses were most at risk from a strike as UPS might be their sole or primary shipping provider, meaning they would have to scramble for alternatives. Large retailers tend to have more diversified delivery providers and are more likely to have contingency plans to soften the blow.
O’Brien had explicitly asked President Joe Biden, who has called himself “the most pro-labor union president,” not to get involved in the negotiations. A group of over two dozen Democratic senators also pledged not to intervene.
The Biden administration helped broker a deal that headed off a freight rail strike last year. Many union members involved in that dispute saw the deal as leaning too heavily in favor of the major rail carriers.
In 1997, about 185,000 UPS workers staged a strike for 15 days. That time, the company reported that the strike cost it more than $600 million. But the last strike happened when e-commerce was in its infancy. UPS has benefited from the e-commerce boom: In 2022 it reported more than $100 billion in revenue, compared with $31 billion in 2002.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Jets' starting quarterback has thrown himself into the culture of his new professional home before he's thrown a single pass.
At the Tony Awards last month, best leading actor in a musical went to J. Harrison Ghee, the nonbinary co-star of "Some Like It Hot." As they praised their mama while nervously patting the trophy's base, something happened that always does during an acceptance speech: a reaction shot of the audience. This one was to Casey Nicholaw, the Broadway musical's director and choreographer. His shows are usually up for Tonys; he's cut away to a lot. But this time, there was something new for a Nicholaw cutaway: Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers, in a silky double-breasted suit and matching dress shirt that paint-chip enthusiasts might have ID'd as "spilled merlot" or "Miss Havisham's gate," was seated just behind Nicholaw. And people -- well, the people who would've known to ask in the first place -- wanted to know: Why? Who invited a four-time N.F.L. MVP and one-time Super Bowl winner? "Aaron Rogers [sic] sitting in the third row of the Tony Awards is the equivalent of me sitting in the third row at the ESPYS," tweeted the actor Josh Gad, whose umbrage made the rounds, aided by the screen-captured image of Rodgers's face frozen between dismay and disorientation.
As for why -- Aaron Rodgers is the new starting quarterback for the Jets. His previous (and only other) professional home was Green Bay, Wis., where, for 18 years, he played for the Packers. Now, there he was at American theater's Super Bowl, stoking bafflement. Rodgers wasn't in a show, hadn't (as far as anybody was aware) seen a show and didn't produce a show. But Rodgers's new teammate, the tight end C.J. Uzomah, did, and he took Rodgers with him to the ceremony, where the play Uzomah co-produced, "Ain't No Mo,"' Jordan E. Cooper's pungent, Blackness-in-America satire, was up for six Tonys. That should have been that. But evidently, sand had found its way into folks' peanut butter.
Comments like Gad's trickled in. And the stinginess of their generosity, their snark and begrudging were a bummer. Rodgers's appearance at the Tonys seemed, to me, like a new resident acclimating to a new residence, getting cozy with its -- forgive me -- tonier perks. A man from one set of communities was breaking the ice with several others, doing more than passing through: crossing over, perhaps.
It's a tedious business, nowadays, disclaiming how much nastier and less patient we all are about everything, from the truth to our tastes. But beef is as much a meal as a state of mind. Fail to stay in your lane and become suspect. The image of Rodgers that traveled around the internet seemed to warrant suspicion. Never mind that he got dressed, showed up and, when Harrison Ghee assured the trans and nonbinary kids watching the broadcast that they matter, Rodgers applauded along with the rest of the room.
But tolerance isn't what's been on my mind. It's curiosity. It's a sense of adventure. For the last four months, Rodgers has appeared to be enjoying himself in select zones of the city. Maybe you saw him shouting the Rangers' goal song during the Stanley Cup playoffs and placed courtside for the Knicks' playoff win against the Heat. He attended two of the season's must-see concerts (Ed Sheeran's, then Taylor Swift's) at the same New Jersey stadium that houses both New York football teams -- Rodgers's new office, basically. (No word on whether he'll be back Saturday to behold Beyoncé's.)
It's so rare anymore that a person of note arrives in this city, jumps right in and, before he even does what he's been hired to do, makes a little splash. The mighty Kevin Durant just spent four years here as a Net and, possibly even to his credit, never got anything wet.
Of course, to draw this conclusion, I first had to give my Etch A Sketch a vigorous shake. Rodgers's final seasons with the Packers didn't seem happy for anybody. He left Green Bay under a cloud. Even as he kept winning awards, his team stalled in the postseason. He wasn't simply vocal about wanting a trade, he sounded petulant, troll-y. A feature of his pandemic life included the misinformation he oozed. When he was asked at a news conference whether he'd received the Covid-19 vaccine, prevarication followed. ("I'm immunized" is how he choose to put it.) During his weekly appearances on Pat McAfee's old Sirius XM show, he became the "I'm just asking" guy, sounding all sorts of persecuted, extemporizing his way around Conspiracy City.
Given the nonstop interest in him (as an athlete, a brother, a boyfriend, a psychedelics enthusiast), Rodgers's views sounded knowingly irresponsible at best and, at worst, dangerous. He'd already cultivated a look to match, too, arriving for training camp, in 2022, with his hair long and oily, his graying beard scraggly, jeans and a white tank top clinging to him. People posted side-by-sides of this outfit next to Nicolas Cage dressed the same in "Con Air," an action-farce set aboard a prison transport plane called the Jailbird. By season's end, Rodgers looked miserable. A face that naturally could seem long had gained another mile. News of his departure from Green Bay was met, in some quarters, with "good riddance." So: The sharp, sheeny person doing step-and-repeats at the Tonys? He seemed like a new man.
One recent Friday afternoon, I found myself walking a few feet behind a fellow who turned out to be Rodgers. We were both on our ways somewhere in SoHo, and I went out of mine to stick with him for a few extra blocks. Not something I tend to do. New Yorkers feel a certain satisfaction from crossing paths with someone notable and not caring. Or "not caring," I should say, because we perform the permission of anonymity. At some point, on Grand, a street that doubles as a parking lot at that time of day, a gentleman with taxi-livery plates leaned out of his window and somehow audibly mouthed, "You're walking behind Aaron Rodgers." He could have yelled at Rodgers himself. He opted instead to alert/impress/warn me but also encourage me to continue whatever reconnaissance he thought I was doing while almost blowing my cover. Really? I mouthed back, mendaciously, and kept it moving.
Truth be told, I wasn't paying that much attention to Rodgers. This jaunt in his shadow was an opportunity to observe a sliver of New York take in the Jets' most plausible hope in eons for a title, even if run an errand was all he did. Not that anybody said a word. The people who noticed him spoke to each other: a UPS guy to a store's security guard, two gentlemen on a FedEx truck. Mostly, they were making sure the other person didn't miss this; they were confirming.
There's a kind of famous that can probably feel our averted eyes. They know that we know and are maybe grateful that we're letting them be. But maybe they're skeeved that we're milling about, hovering, stopping in our tracks, but not simply saying "hi" or "I love you" or "Dude, please, you have to get us to the Super Bowl." I don't know how going out for a walk went for Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay. But what it seemed like he was experiencing that Friday in Soho was true anonymity, which for a certain class of celebrity can seem like liberation. We've seen it all here in this city, even the likes of this guy. And that, in turn, could be an opportunity for a star to feel like a civilian, which, it must be said, is how Rodgers looked, pausing his walk, it seemed, to make sure he was headed the right way. That's a question that's dogged him all over the city, especially at the Tonys: You lost? I don't know, he's been seeming pretty found to me.
Sports are a strangely transformative human event. They change people -- the people who play them, the people who watch them. The pandemic changed sports and maybe the athletes, maybe Aaron Rodgers. Looking for unorthodoxy, he discovered villainy and embraced it, perhaps in a scheme to get traded, damning being adored in pursuit of a self that seemed true. People were baffled by that, too. In professional wrestling, they call this sort of manufactured misbehavior a heel turn. Done wrong, it's baffling.
For now, the heel in him appears to have mellowed. So what classification will make sense for Rodgers' time here as a Person of Interest? A second chance, a redo, a doubling down, a clean slate? Revenge? Rodgers has yet to throw a single touchdown pass for the city. The season could be glorious -- or the sort of debacle that turns a simple jaunt like the one he took "with" me the other day into a trial. Maybe the professional relationship doesn't last more than a year. But maybe the residential one lasts, thrives. Rodgers turns 40 at the end of the regular season. I'm not an athlete, let alone an elite one. I am, however, a New Yorker, who turned 40 here, and I know how it feels to let some of the past go, to actually, finally have a home here -- here in New York Freakin' City. Whether you're broke or flush, it's a relief, a great fortune, possibly the seed of some social and emotional gluttony. "If this town is just an apple," Michael Jackson once sang, "Then let me take a bite."
Maybe he'll come to love about this place what lots of us do, that despite the evident suffering, inequality and mismanagement, New York remains a town where you can experience a lacerating, queer farce about Black existentialism like "Ain't No Mo"' and an artist as self-astute and paradigmatically white as Taylor Swift and teams with fates as addled and fanbases as inflamed as the Rangers and Knicks (and the Jets and the Mets), where people on the street will give you your space until, of course, they won't.
I caught Rodgers at the Tonys and swore I recognized a guy discovering what it's like to be himself but somewhere else, to experience what he's seen on TV and in the movies, what he's read in books. It's been a dream for some of us to live here, in "the greatest city in the world," to quote the musical about the history undergirding such dreams. I'm sure I'm being naïve. But that's sports, which really isn't so different from art. It works best when you suspend disbelief.

This Is How The Bosses Win: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NOTTINGHAM, Md. -- Agnes Torregoza came to this country when she was a toddler, brought from the Philippines by her parents. Her mother found a teaching job in the Baltimore County Public School District, and the family set about cobbling together a new life.
Both parents eventually got union jobs in the public schools and moved with their children into a prefabricated home in the unincorporated reaches of the Baltimore suburbs. Her parents, Ms. Torregoza explained, had very definite ideas about the aesthetics of the American dream -- everything should be fresh.
"My parents are really into, 'Oh, we're in America,"' Ms. Torregoza, 20, said. "'I want to have a brand-new house. I want to have a new car."'
When it came time to forge her own path, Ms. Torregoza, a slight woman with a black fringe of bangs and exactingly applied makeup, puzzled over her options. She'd graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, a competitive magnet high school, and took some community college classes. She dreamed of attending a liberal arts college, but found the cost of tuition both unattainable and philosophically repellent.
"All these people who talked about race and class had spent so much money to go to school," she said. "How can you talk about making things more equitable, but you're spending $ 30,000 a year on tuition?"
So Ms. Torregoza applied for a Starbucks barista job in a strip mall near home. She'd heard about the coffee conglomerate's generous benefits -- tuition money, company stock, health insurance for part-time workers. But once she got to work, disillusionment set in.
The first thing she noticed: There never seemed to be enough people on the clock. Everybody rushed around while automated systems logged the speed of drive-through transactions -- ideally, 30 to 40 seconds -- and whether surveyed customers rated the baristas likable. Not that she had time to ruminate on her scores -- Ms. Torregoza says she and her colleagues could hardly attend to basic hygiene. They often found themselves too frenzied to wipe down tables, clean the bathrooms or follow orders to wash their hands every half-hour, she said.
Oddly, despite this state of affairs, Ms. Torregoza couldn't get enough shifts. She dreamed of saving money, moving out on her own, maybe transferring to a Starbucks downtown -- but for that, she'd need to work. She got, at most, 25 or 27 hours a week, which was considered generous for Starbucks, where baristas say they rarely get full-time hours and even struggle for the 20 they need to qualify for benefits.
Ms. Torregoza's discontent was growing, and she wasn't alone. She'd donned her green Starbucks apron just as a labor insurrection was exploding across the company. The hectic, high-risk pandemic shifts had racked up record profits for Starbucks, but left many of the baristas exhausted and embittered. Workers at one cafe after the next were voting to unionize -- more than 330 of its thousands of locations so far. Their demands include better pay ( $ 20 an hour minimum for baristas, with annual raises), fair and consistent scheduling and easier access to the benefits that Starbucks executives were always touting.
The Nottingham Starbucks voted to join Starbucks Workers United in June 2022 -- and Ms. Torregoza and her colleagues stepped into a world of trouble.
The corporate dirty war that ensued -- in Nottingham and at newly unionized Starbucks cafes across the country -- draws a sobering picture of employee rights casually crushed and labor laws too weak to help. Starbucks continues to fight and appeal the many labor complaints pending against it and maintains that the company has done nothing wrong.
But these professions of innocence are countered by piles of testimony from workers and National Labor Relations Board findings suggesting that Starbucks has indeed illegally repressed employees' rights. The company has so far racked up a staggering number of complaints from the agency. In 100 cases, many of which consolidate a number of incidents, regional N.L.R.B. offices have decided there is sufficient evidence to pursue litigation against Starbucks. That includes a nationwide complaint, consolidating 32 charges across 28 states, alleging that Starbucks failed or refused to bargain with union representatives from 163 cafes.
Starbucks lacks the glamour of Hollywood and the indispensability of UPS, but as strikes and union drives erupt across the economy, the coffee workers' struggle illuminates the stark and sometimes insurmountable challenges confronted by ordinary American workers who try to exercise their right to organize.
That Starbucks is carrying on this campaign in plain sight may be the most damning aspect: Union busting is illegal, but consequences are inconsequential. The Starbucks case demonstrates that a large corporation can effectively bust a union with time, by dithering over details and exhausting legal appeals. According to national labor laws, an employer "must bargain in good faith." But that is a squishy and essentially unenforceable rule. Starbucks may yet succeed in smothering one of the most energized labor movements of our time.
It's important to understand what Starbucks has done -- and what it hasn't done. The company has been accused of deploying familiar anti-labor tactics, such as the shuttering of some union stronghold cafes. (Starbucks denies closing stores in response to union drives and blames other factors, such as crime.) Union activists reported being spied upon, harassed or fired on flimsy pretexts, complaints that Starbucks disputes.
But Starbucks has also done a lot of nothing -- time-buying, morale-eroding, innocent-seeming nothing. The company dedicated to caffeinating the world turns out to be very good at moving slowly, and the inaction is devastating for the workers, many of whom are economically vulnerable. Starbucks, on the other hand, faces little risk. Even if the company eventually ends up losing cases on the final appeal -- a stage that could take years -- the N.L.R.B. is barred from imposing monetary penalties. The board can only order employers to "make whole" anyone who lost money and warn them to do better.
"We'd email them, and they weren't responding," said Marina Multhaup, a Seattle-based lawyer who represents all the Starbucks unions in the Pacific Northwest. "So we'd file a charge, which is really all we can do."
"Months and months later," Ms. Multhaup said, the National Labor Relations Board "agreed that Starbucks was not bargaining. And we go to a whole hearing about it. But meanwhile, it's been months and months."
Across the country, the coffee company has drastically slowed negotiations by insisting (illegally, according to the N.L.R.B.'s general counsel) on in-person bargaining. The demand for face-to-face negotiations has severely hindered coffee shop workers who unionized in part because their schedules were erratic. When union representatives join by Zoom, Starbucks representatives abruptly stand and walk out.
"It really puts on display the whole power differential," Ms. Multhaup said.
Meanwhile, not a single Starbucks union member has gotten a contract, and the union says the company hasn't suggested any counterproposals in response to union demands.
These passive tactics of delay and avoidance are quiet and undramatic -- especially compared with the bloody strikes and picket brawls of America's past -- but remarkably effective at crushing nascent unions, labor experts warn. We hear a lot about hard-fought unionization votes at Amazon and Trader Joe's and REI, but once the election excitement fades, half the certified unions never secure a contract, said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
"The main line of defense is, 'We're just not going to sign a contract,' and that's just as effective," Mr. Lichtenstein said. "And if you don't have it within a year, well, the turnover is so great, and some of the people are no longer there."
"The labor law has become broken," he said.
As for the N.L.R.B., the agency has made no secret that it's struggling to keep pace. Despite surging interest in unions -- including a 53 percent jump in union petitions from 2021 to 2022 -- the agency operates on a tight budget and a skeleton crew. The number of field staff workers available to carry out labor investigations today is half of what it was 20 years ago.
In the realm of unionized Starbucks cafes, some of which have clashed spectacularly with management, Nottingham isn't known as a battleground. But Ms. Torregoza and her colleagues have nevertheless endured waves of fallout this past year.
Ms. Torregoza's weekly hours gradually dwindled to 10 after the election, she said, forcing her to ration gas and delay veterinary visits for her cat, Charlie. Starbucks managers across the country are accused of slashing unionized workers' hours to starvation levels. When Ms. Torregoza tried to supplement her income by picking up shifts in nearby Starbucks locations, as she had often done before, she found herself stonewalled. One manager, she said, finally remarked that Ms. Torregoza's union work made her an unwelcome presence. (Ms. Torregoza has filed unfair labor practice complaints over this alleged discrimination.)
"They're trying to get us to a point where we all just quit," said Thanya Cruz Borrazas, who worked with Ms. Torregoza in the Nottingham cafe and in the union.
Meanwhile, the cafes that didn't unionize were reaping fiercely desired improvements -- the dress code was finally loosened and tipping by credit card, rather than just cash, was enabled.
Howard Schultz, a steely eyed, self-made former Starbucks chief executive, has told his story all over the country: the impoverished childhood in shoddy housing; the disabled and mistreated father; final vindication through the achievement of the American dream, a phrase he likes to use.
It's a good story, and we bought it -- we bought his coffee at a premium price, and we bought him, too. Hillary Clinton, by many accounts, planned to nominate Mr. Schultz for labor secretary if she'd won the presidential election in 2016. Mr. Schultz himself has toyed with the idea of running for president.
Mr. Schultz frequently lectures people about having built a "different kind of company" that respects the rights of employees, whom he calls partners. An empty chair gapes at every board meeting in a symbolic nod to the partners, who may or may not feel gratified at being represented by a piece of furniture.
When the recent wave of labor organizing first started to foment among Starbucks workers in Buffalo, Mr. Schultz was one of the corporate luminaries who jetted into town to discourage the union. It didn't work, though -- in 2021, a Buffalo Starbucks became the first company-owned cafe to unionize, and other stores quickly followed. Mr. Schultz greeted the union with an indignation that has yet to fade. He has flouted an N.L.R.B. order to apologize to his workers and to film and distribute a video explaining his employees' rights.
"Starbucks Coffee Company did not break the law," Mr. Schultz replied flatly in March when lawmakers in Congress questioned him about the video.
The baristas from Nottingham were there that day. The union had paid for their train tickets to Washington so that they could watch Mr. Schultz testify at the Capitol. He hadn't wanted to face lawmakers' questions; he'd agreed to come only after he was threatened with a subpoena. But the baristas were ebullient. It was, in a sense, a business trip -- a first for Ms. Torregoza, who wore her union T-shirt and took careful notes.
"It was very surreal," she said. "My mom texted me, like, 'Oh, I heard on NPR that Schultz is going to testify today,' and I was like, 'Yeah, I'll be there."'
The storied entrepreneur came across as icy and defensive, insisting Starbucks had done nothing wrong and that his anti-union stance was simply a "preference" that he had every right to express.
"Yes, I have billions of dollars," he snapped when lawmakers referred to him as a billionaire. "I earned it. No one gave it to me. Anyone who keeps labeling this billionaire thing," he added, "it's your moniker constantly and it's unfair."
This intransigence seemed improbable from a public figure whose own life story begins with his father, a truck driver, suffering a severe leg injury on the job, which threw his family into desperate straits. Mr. Schultz, a child at the time, has called this a "defining moment" in his life.
Upbraiding him for "squeezing the people who made you rich," Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, invoked Mr. Schultz's father.
"Your father had no rights and your family paid the price. That is how your workers now feel," Mr. Markey thundered. "That is something I think, Mr. Schultz, that you just fundamentally don't understand. These workers are just like your father, and they have no rights."
Mr. Schultz appeared offended at hearing the young baristas compared with his father.
"You bring up my father," he sputtered. "You don't understand, sir, my father was a World War II veteran. He fought for this country in the South Pacific. You don't understand."
By the time labor experts and unionized workers testified to Starbucks' abuses, Mr. Schultz and his team -- a small army of nattily dressed advisers and lawyers -- had left the building.
The baristas from Nottingham recalled watching him go, wondering if he'd look their way.
He didn't.
A billionaire who doesn't want to be called a billionaire, who blusters when his company's service workers get likened to the blue-collar worker who raised him -- this is the chasm between our putative national values and our daily reality. We want to believe in a middle-class America where hard work weaves its own safety net. But millions of workers don't earn enough money to cover basic expenses.
Unions helped create the American middle class and delivered livable pay, a two-day weekend, sick leave and overtime. But their power has largely faded. While some industries like Hollywood remain heavily unionized and a few private companies like UPS are still union strongholds, organizers have struggled to penetrate the service sector, which contains a majority of American jobs. Unions now enjoy the highest U.S. approval rating in decades, thanks partly to the deeply demoralizing experience many service workers endured during the pandemic and partly, no doubt, to the growing realization that neither corporate benevolence nor legislative nobility can be expected to save us.
The federal minimum wage, which has not increased since 2009, now sits at a plainly unlivable $ 7.25 an hour.
Ms. Torregoza was still in elementary school in 2012, when fast food workers began the "Fight for $ 15" to lobby for a minimum wage hike. That struggle has dragged on so long that the original (and still unmet) demand is outdated and insufficient. Most Americans, no matter their political beliefs, now believe that people should earn at least $ 20 an hour, according to recent polling.
In his testimony, Mr. Schultz repeatedly reminded lawmakers that the average Starbucks worker earns $ 17.50 -- more than the minimum wage in all 50 states.
Then Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, told Mr. Schultz bluntly that the salary he was touting wasn't enough to survive.
"Even $ 17, that's not a living wage in this day and age," Mr. Braun said. "Any large corporation shouldn't necessarily be bragging about $ 15- or $ 20-an-hour wages."
Ms. Cruz Borrazas worked in Nottingham through the pandemic. This, she recalls, required stifling her fear of getting sick while scrambling to make ever more drinks, ever more quickly, with fewer clocked-in colleagues to help. At one point, a burst pipe in the cafe forced her to slog through a few inches of water, trying not to think about the electrical wires or her sodden feet. In the middle of all that, she'd sometimes glance at the run report tallying the sales.
"I'm over here, like, having palpitations because I don't have time to get a sip of water," she said. "And it'll be like, they just made $ 700."
Managers at the Nottingham cafe did not respond to phone messages; a former Nottingham manager who has since left Starbucks also declined an interview.
It was during the pandemic that Starbucks workers began to unionize in earnest -- when the job started to feel physically dangerous, when the shifts got more hectic and baristas had to tangle with mask-refusing customers in between filling takeout and delivery orders.
"We felt very disposable," said Alexis Rizzo, a Buffalo shift supervisor who became a key union organizer, only to be fired, she says, for being a few minutes late. (Starbucks has said her absences were more egregious.) "People were angry."
Mr. Schultz speaks of Italian espresso bars and cushy benefits, but workers describe a reality that is harsher.
"You're constantly seeing the company boast about how they have the best benefits in the industry, and then I see my co-workers on Medicaid because they don't have enough hours or it's too expensive," Ms. Rizzo said. "It's just a lot of the company pretending to be something they're not."
The baristas from Nottingham asked to meet me in downtown Baltimore, at a nonunion Starbucks in a bustling neighborhood near the Johns Hopkins University campus. Unlike their cafe, which is set among flat, broad roads between Lowe's Home Improvement and Taco Bell, this Starbucks was urban and airy, with no drive-through in sight. I wasn't sure why we were there.
At 22, Ms. Cruz Borrazas has a quiet, somewhat dreamy bearing, long curls tumbling over her shoulders. Born in Uruguay, she too was brought as a toddler to the United States, where her parents work blue-collar jobs in cleaning, construction and demolition. Ms. Cruz Borrazas has a green card but is not a citizen, and she never had health insurance until she managed to buy it through her job at Starbucks. After the union vote, she said, her hours were eventually cut so badly she risked dropping below the threshold to keep the benefits. She'd recently been cashing out her sick time to supplement her paychecks.
"Yes, there's a light at the end of the tunnel," she told me that day. "But it's a long tunnel, and there are monsters."
In her four years at Starbucks, she says, she never saw a barista get full-time hours. None of her colleagues, she told me, can afford to live alone.
But then she, too, mentions the American dream.
"I feel like the union is my only way out," she said. "It's the ticket to the middle class."
I was starting to understand why we'd met in the city, the walkable streets, the cafe full of students and downtown workers, the suggestion of self-sufficiency.
When Ms. Torregoza talked about the union, she kept veering into discussion of her life in the far suburbs, which she considered sterile and unsustainable. There aren't enough sidewalks, she said, and developments keep going up, like the Crumbl Cookies that had recently materialized a few doors down from Starbucks in the strip mall.
"It's a little unreal," she said. "It stresses me out, honestly."
This was the malaise of a youth spent in the shadows of enormous companies hungry for low-wage workers to staff identical counters. Imagine being brought thousands of miles in pursuit of a dream and then, as you come of age, squinting into this landscape where there is nothing but selling and shopping, and trying to understand what it was supposed to look like.
Life was moving faster for Ms. Cruz Borrazas through the spring. She was taking on more union responsibility, using unscheduled hours to advise Starbucks workers who were organizing in other places. Invited by the Workers' Rights Institute at Georgetown Law School, she spoke on a panel with Senator Sherrod Brown and Jennifer Abruzzo, the N.L.R.B.'s general counsel. But she had to send a few emails before getting the badly needed fee she said she'd been promised, leaving her feeling humiliated.
By the time spring gave way to summer, her hours had gotten cut so badly that she was officially broke -- her bank balance dropped into negative territory. At that point, Ms. Cruz Borrazas' health broke down. Malnourished and exhausted, she drove to the library one day but felt unable to get out of the car. So she drove to a hospital, where she was admitted for several days.
I heard first from Ms. Torregoza and later from Ms. Cruz Borrazas herself that upon getting out of the hospital, she'd quit her job at Starbucks and withdrawn from the union.
Starbucks can't be blamed for Ms. Cruz Borrazas' health crisis. Plenty of Starbucks workers are organizing under tremendous pressure without winding up in the hospital.
But listening on the phone as she described her breakdown, I noticed that material want and bodily fatigue were tangled into her thoughts. She'd been forcing things, she told me, trying to stand up to corporations, and that had been a mistake. To work and hustle as hard as she and her parents had always done, she told me, was "literally killing us ... it's killing our brains." She'd been in service her whole life, she said, and she felt unable to continue.
"All I ever wanted was to go back to my own country, see my family, not have to work so much, not have to see my parents struggling so much," she said. She told me that God had finally stepped in and told her that she could "just chill."
I remembered her describing how as a child, she feared illness not because it hurt, but because the cost of seeing a doctor could cripple her family. I thought about how badly she wanted to make herself safe and make her family stable by securing a spot in the elusive middle class. She'd glimpsed a way forward with the union. And then she'd lost it.
The Nottingham union is "cold" now, Ms. Torregoza recently told me. It's not one of the Starbucks sites where employees have voted to decertify the union. But turnover in Nottingham has been heavy, she said -- about half the staff has left and been replaced over the past year or so -- and, as the labor experts warned, union enthusiasm has withered.
The Nottingham workers never got a chance to bargain (Starbucks claims this is the union's fault for insisting on Zoom meetings). As the union fervor dies down, Ms. Torregoza says her hours are starting to inch back up again. I suggested that the old status quo might be asserting itself.
"That's not going to happen as long as I'm around," Ms. Torregoza said.
But I think it's possible. Maybe this quiet fading, engineered by a company with time and money to burn, is how the union dies.

Full text: With the Teamsters contract set to expire Aug. 1, pay for part-time workers is a major hurdle. A walkout could rattle the U.S. economy.
Barely a week before the contract for more than 325,000 United Parcel Service workers expires, union and company negotiators have yet to reach an agreement to avert a strike that could knock the American economy off stride.
UPS and the union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have resolved a variety of thorny issues, including heat safety and forced overtime. But they remain stalemated on pay for part-time workers, who account for more than half the union's workers at UPS.
A strike, which could come as soon as Aug. 1, could have significant consequences for the company, the e-commerce industry and the supply chain.
UPS handles about one-quarter of the tens of millions of packages that are shipped daily in the United States, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. Experts have said competitors lack the scale to seamlessly replace that lost capacity.
The Teamsters have cited the risks its members took to help generate the company's strong pandemic-era performance as a reason that they deserve large raises. UPS's adjusted net income rose more than 70 percent between 2019 and last year, to over $ 11 billion.
The contract talks broke down on July 5 in vituperation. The two sides are to resume negotiations in the coming days, but the window for an agreement before the current five-year contract expires is tight.
In a Facebook post this month, the union said the company's latest offer would have "left behind" many part-timers, whose jobs include sorting packages and loading trucks. The post said part-timers earned "near-minimum wage in many parts of the country."
UPS, which says it relies heavily on part-timers to navigate bursts of activity over the course of a day and to ramp up its work force during busier months, said it had proposed significant wage increases before the talks broke down. According to the company, part-timers currently earn about $ 20 an hour on average after 30 days as well as paid time off, health care and pension benefits. The company noted that many part-timers graduated to jobs as full-time drivers, which pay $ 42 an hour on average after four years.
The union has gone out of its way to highlight the challenges facing part-time workers. In television interviews and at rallies, the Teamsters president, Sean O'Brien, has emphasized what the union calls "part-time poverty" jobs. He has frequently been joined by leaders of other unions and politicians, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat.
UPS said Wednesday that it was "prepared to increase our industry-leading pay and benefits." But it is unclear if the company will satisfy the union's demands.
"UPS certainly wants to reach an agreement, but not at the expense of its ability to compete long-term," said Alan Amling, a former UPS executive and a fellow at the University of Tennessee's Global Supply Chain Institute.
Professor Amling estimated that it would cost the company $ 850 million per year to increase wages $ 5 an hour for all part-time employees represented by the Teamsters.
The company, which normally reports its second-quarter earnings in late July, has delayed the report this year until after the strike deadline. UPS said that the timing was within the required window for reporting its earnings and that it had never published a date other than Aug. 8 for the coming release.
The sometimes-volatile negotiations began in April, and the Teamsters announced in mid-June that their UPS members had voted, with a 97 percent majority, to authorize a strike.
Less than two weeks later, the union said that it was walking away from the table over an "appalling counterproposal" from the company on raises and cost-of-living adjustments and that a strike "now appears inevitable."
The two sides resumed their discussions the week before the Fourth of July and soon resolved what was arguably their most contentious issue: a class of worker created under the existing contract.
UPS said the arrangement was intended to allow workers to take on dual roles, like sorting packages some days and driving on other days -- especially Saturdays -- to keep up with growing demand for weekend delivery.
But the Teamsters said that the hybrid idea hadn't come to pass, and that in practice the new category of workers drove full time Tuesday through Saturday, only for less pay than other drivers. (The company said some employees did work under the hybrid arrangement.)
Under the agreement reached this month, the lower-paid category would be eliminated and workers who drove Tuesday through Saturday would be converted to regular full-time drivers.
That agreement also stipulated that no driver would be required to work an unscheduled sixth day in a week, which drivers had at times been forced to do to keep up with Saturday demand.
Despite progress on these issues, Mr. O'Brien could face a delicate test persuading members to approve a deal if it falls short of the lofty expectations he helped set. He won the union's top position in 2021 while regularly criticizing his immediate predecessor, James P. Hoffa, for being too accommodating toward employers.
Mr. O'Brien argued that Mr. Hoffa had effectively forced UPS workers to accept a deeply flawed contract in 2018, even after they voted it down, and accused his rival in the race to succeed Mr. Hoffa of being reluctant to strike against the company.
He began focusing members' attention on the contract and a possible strike even before formally taking over as president in March last year, and has spoken in superlative terms about the union's goals for a new contract.
"This UPS agreement is going to be the defining moment in organized labor," he told activists with Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a group that backed his candidacy, in a speech last fall.
The union under Mr. O'Brien has held training sessions in recent months for strike captains and contract action team members, who rally co-workers to help pressure the company.
And he has strongly urged the White House not to wade into the contract negotiation. In his Boston youth, "if two people had a disagreement, and you had nothing to do with it, you just kept walking," he said during a recent webinar with members. "We echoed that to the White House on numerous occasions." (Administration officials have said they are in touch with both sides.)
In some ways the context for this year's negotiations resembles the circumstances of the nationwide Teamsters strike at UPS in 1997. UPS was also in the midst of several profitable years, and the rapid growth in its part-time work force loomed large.
But while a reformist president, Ron Carey, had mobilized the union for a fight, its ranks appeared divided between his supporters and those of Mr. Hoffa, who had narrowly lost an election for the union's presidency the year before. The union may have more leverage this time because its members appear far more unified under Mr. O'Brien.
Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies labor and follows the Teamsters closely, said that while the ramp-up to the current contract fight had lagged in some parts of the country, where more conservative local officials are less enthusiastic, Mr. O'Brien had no serious opposition within the union.
"Not everybody is a fan of O'Brien, but they're not actively organizing to undermine him the way people were with Ron Carey in the '90s," Dr. Eidlin said. "It's a huge, huge difference."
Still, for all his pugilistic statements, Mr. O'Brien remains an establishment figure who appears to prefer reaching a deal to going on strike, and he has subtly acted to make one less likely.
Earlier in the negotiations, Mr. O'Brien had said that UPS employees wouldn't work beyond Aug. 1 without a ratified contract, and that the two sides needed to reach a deal by July 5 to give members a chance to approve it in time. But last weekend he said UPS employees would continue working on Aug. 1 as long as the two sides had reached a tentative deal.
"This isn't a shift," a Teamsters spokeswoman said Friday by email. "This is how you get a contract. Our pressure and deadline on UPS forced them to move in ways they hadn't before."

Full text: Federal regulators released a plan that would allow a new generation of small aircraft to transport people short distances.
For years, flying taxis have represented an exciting but distant dream, fueled in part by industry hype. Now they have a rollout plan and a target arrival date: 2028.
In a document published on Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration outlined the steps that it and others need to take to usher in a competitive air taxi market in at least one location by 2028 with limited operations starting as early as 2025. The vehicles look like small airplanes or helicopters and can take off and land vertically, allowing them to operate from the middle of cities, whisking people to airports or vacation destinations like the Hamptons in New York or Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
The F.A.A.'s plan is notable because it reflects confidence that the technology is only a few years away, and because it comes from the agency that will oversee certification of the aircraft as well as the rules that pilots and companies must follow.
"These things will be coming on the scene, and our job is to try and be ahead of the curve," said Paul Fontaine, an assistant F.A.A. administrator who oversees the modernization of the air transportation system. The plan is intended to serve as a guide for introducing the aircraft in a way that is predictable and routine, the agency said.
Creating the conditions for air taxis to zip above one or more cities by 2028 will be no small task, and aircraft manufacturers will need the help of many others besides the F.A.A., including other federal agencies and state and local governments.
Air taxis are likely to face resistance from local officials and residents who fear that they will be safety hazards or a nuisance. Legislation and lawsuits seeking to block their use in cities and neighborhoods could set up pitched battles.
But first the aircraft must be certified. Many are designed to be fully electric, though some could be powered by hydrogen or a combination of jet fuels and batteries. The aircraft are still under development by various companies and can carry only a handful of passengers. They also contain an array of new technologies and systems, many of which will have to be individually certified to meet the F.A.A.'s standards.
"With a lot of new aircraft technology, you bring on one very novel thing and you work your way through that," said Pat Anderson, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a co-founder of VerdeGo Aero, a hybrid air taxi company. "In these vehicles, we're trying to bring many, many things forward, all at once."
Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are among the U.S. air taxi companies furthest along in that certification process, and both hope to have certified aircraft and start commercial services in 2025, ahead of the F.A.A.'s 2028 goal. To achieve their targets, they will have to win the approval of the federal agency and local officials for specific services and routes.
But air taxi companies have had to delay such plans in the past. In 2017, Uber said it was working on electric air taxis that would conduct passenger flights by 2020. Instead, that was the year Uber sold its air taxi unit to Joby, which said at the time that service could begin "as early as 2023."
Even traditional airplanes made by manufacturers with decades of experience, such as Boeing and Airbus, often face long certification delays. And F.A.A. officials said they would not compromise safety to meet the 2028 target.
Limits on battery capacity mean the distance that many air taxis can fly will be restricted. As a result, the aircraft will probably first be used to transport people in cities to nearby airports -- a service that some companies already offer with helicopters in cities like New York.
Air taxi companies will have to compete for scarce real estate, navigate city and state regulations, develop the infrastructure to charge or fuel aircraft, and gain acceptance from residents. They will also have to hire and train pilots, who are in high demand.
Still, the F.A.A.'s plan underscores a growing belief among industry analysts and executives that the necessary elements are coming together for air taxis to take off.
"People always ask me, 'Why is this happening now?"' said Adam Goldstein, the chief executive of Archer. "It's the tech, the regulation and the money that allowed us get here."
The F.A.A. has been criticized for moving too slowly on certifying air taxis and other novel aircraft. In a June report, the Transportation Department's inspector general concluded that poor communication internally and externally could increase "the risk of certification and operational delays."
But the agency has been making some progress, recently updating a technical road map for rolling out air taxis in cities and publishing a proposed rule in June governing how air taxi pilots should be trained and certified.
Air taxi manufacturers have made technological strides, too, with several now regularly test-flying their aircraft.
Investors have taken notice. Several major air taxi companies have gone public in recent years, including Joby, Archer, Lilium in Germany and Vertical Aerospace in England. This year, Archer, Joby and Lilium raised more than $ 150 million each from investors.
Many of the companies have also deepened ties with major airlines or automakers. Stellantis, the automaker that owns Jeep, Peugeot and other brands, is helping to build a factory in Georgia for Archer, which has a tentative agreement to sell several hundred aircraft to United Airlines and Mesa Airlines. Joby has a close relationship with Toyota.
Boeing recently bought Wisk, which is working on an autonomous air taxi. And Embraer, a Brazilian company that makes smaller commercial planes, created its own air taxi company, Eve Air Mobility.
The businesses are all vying for a market that could someday be worth tens of billions of dollars. The aircraft might replace some trips that take place through Uber and Lyft. For airlines, air taxis could help them win over or maintain the loyalty of affluent passengers.
There are other opportunities, too. UPS is working with the air taxi maker Beta Technologies to test air taxis for cargo in the United Arab Emirates. Beta and Joby have also worked with the U.S. military.
The key to winning over the public will be making air taxis cheap enough that many people can use them, said Michael Huerta, a former F.A.A. administrator, who is now a director on the boards of Delta Air Lines and Joby.
"Over time, it will get larger public acceptance, but critical to that is going to be cost," he said. "If you see this only as a service for very wealthy people, and you're dealing with the impacts of it, you might be less accepting."

Full text: Why should you care about the strikes in Hollywood? Because they are much more than a revolt of the privileged.
In Hollywood, the cool kids have joined the picket line.
I mean no offense, as a writer, to the screenwriters who have been on strike against film and TV studios for over two months. But writers know the score. We're the words, not the faces. The cleverest picket sign joke is no match for the attention-focusing power of Margot Robbie or Matt Damon.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing TV and film actors, joined the writers in a walkout over how Hollywood divvies up the cash in the streaming era and how humans can thrive in the artificial-intelligence era. With that star power comes an easy cheap shot: Why should anybody care about a bunch of privileged elites whining about a dream job?
But for all the focus that a few boldface names will get in this strike, I invite you to consider a term that has come up a lot in the current negotiations: "Background actors."
You probably don't think much about background actors. You're not meant to, hence the name. They're the nonspeaking figures who populate the screen's margins, making Gotham City or King's Landing or the beaches of Normandy feel real, full and lived-in.
And you might have more in common with them than you think.
The lower-paid actors who make up the vast bulk of the profession are facing simple dollars-and-cents threats to their livelihoods. They're trying to maintain their income amid the vanishing of residual payments, as streaming has shortened TV seasons and decimated the syndication model. They're seeking guardrails against A.I. encroaching on their jobs.
There's also a particular, chilling question on the table: Who owns a performer's face? Background actors are seeking protections and better compensation in the practice of scanning their images for digital reuse.
In a news conference about the strike, a union negotiator said that the studios were seeking the rights to scan and use an actor's image "for the rest of eternity" in exchange for one day's pay. The studios argue that they are offering "groundbreaking" protections against the misuse of actors' images, and counter that their proposal would only allow a company to use the "digital replica" on the specific project a background actor was hired for.
Still, the long-term "Black Mirror" implications -- the practice was the actual premise of a recent episode -- are unignorable. If a digital replica of you -- without your bothersome need for money and the time to lead a life -- can do the job, who needs you?
You could, I guess, make the argument that if someone is insignificant enough to be replaced by software, then they're in the wrong business. But background work and small roles are precisely the routes to someday promoting your blockbuster on the red carpet. And many talented artists build entire careers around a series of small jobs. (Pamela Adlon's series "Better Things" is a great portrait of the life of ordinary working actors.)
In the end, Hollywood's fight isn't far removed from the threats to many of us in today's economy. "We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines," Fran Drescher, the actors' guild president, said in announcing the strike.
You and I may be the protagonists of our own narratives, but in the grand scheme most of us are background players. We face the same risk -- that every time a technological or cultural shift happens, companies will rewrite the terms of employment to their advantage, citing financial pressures while paying their top executives tens and hundreds of millions.
Maybe it's unfair that exploitation gets more attention when it involves a union that Meryl Streep belongs to. (If the looming UPS strike materializes, it might grab the spotlight for blue-collar labor.) And there's certainly a legitimate critique of white-collar workers who were blasé about automation until A.I. threatened their own jobs.
But work is work, and some dynamics are universal. As the entertainment reporter and critic Maureen Ryan writes in "Burn It Down," her investigation of workplace abuses throughout Hollywood, "It is not the inclination nor the habit of the most important entities in the commercial entertainment industry to value the people who make their products."
If you don't believe Ryan, listen to the anonymous studio executive, speaking of the writers' strike, who told the trade publication Deadline, "The endgame is to allow things to drag out until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses."
You may think of Hollywood creatives as a privileged class, but if their employers think about them like this, are you sure yours thinks any differently of you? Most of us, in Hollywood or outside it, are facing a common question: Can we have a working world in which you can survive without being a star?
You may never notice background actors if they're doing their jobs well. Yet they're the difference between a sterile scene and a living one. They create the impression that, beyond the close focus on the beautiful leads, there is a full, complete universe, whether it's the galaxy of the "Star Wars" franchise or the mundane reality that you and I live in.
They are there to say that we, too, are out here, that we make the world a world, that we at least deserve our tiny places in the corner of the screen.

U.A.W. Talks Quite Likely To Be Testy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The U.A.W., with a more confrontational leader, aims to win back wage and benefit concessions and insulate jobs from the rise of electric vehicles.
The three Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have begun negotiating a new labor contract in what could become the most contentious talks between the two sides in perhaps half a century.
The discussions, which formally started on Thursday, come as General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis have posted a long streak of strong profits in North America, and after the U.A.W. elected a president who has vowed to win back many of the wage and benefit concessions the union has ceded over the last two decades.
Shawn Fain, an outsider candidate, prevailed in an upset election victory over the incumbent U.A.W. president this year largely by promising to take a more militant approach to contract negotiations than his recent predecessors. Since then, he has expressed a readiness to shut down factories to achieve the goals of the union, which represents 150,000 hourly workers employed by the three Detroit companies.
"If the Big Three don't give us our fair share, then they are choosing to strike themselves," Mr. Fain, 54, said Wednesday as he greeted workers ending their shift at a G.M. electric vehicle plant in Detroit. "We are not afraid to take action. Our union is united. We can't be afraid to stand up and fight."
A day later, Mr. Fain underscored his view by breaking with tradition and declining to take part in the usual ceremonial opening of negotiations, where in the past the U.A.W.'s president shook hands with the automakers' chief executives as a gesture of harmony for photographers and television cameras before the two sides got down to bargaining.
"I'm not shaking hands with any C.E.O.s until they do right by our members and we fix the broken status quo," Mr. Fain said.
The bargaining is taking place as the labor movement is showing renewed strength in the United States. A strike by Hollywood writers against movie and television producers just entered its third month. Hollywood actors went on strike on Friday. Graduate student teachers -- some represented by the U.A.W. -- have been on strike at universities across the country since April. Hotel workers in Los Angeles walked off the job for three days in June.
In the last few years, more than 300 Starbucks stores as well as some Trader Joe's stores, Chipotle restaurants and an Amazon warehouse in New York have unionized. The Teamsters union is threatening to strike against UPS in August if the two cannot agree on a new contract.
"We are seeing in very diverse workplaces a new interest in unions and a willingness to strike," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the labor movement for more than three decades. "What we don't know yet is how large this movement is going to become and how far it is going to go."
The negotiations coincide with the start of the 2024 presidential election campaign. The U.A.W. traditionally backs the Democratic candidate, but the union has withheld an endorsement of President Biden to push the White House to up its support of unions.
In Detroit, the contract talks are playing out amid a momentous transition to electric vehicles. G.M., Ford and Stellantis have been investing billions of dollars in new technologies and battery plants, although so far they have introduced only a handful of new E.V.s, sales of these vehicles are growing but low, and none of the three automakers has yet made money off E.V.s.
This transition presents a concern for the union because E.V.s have far fewer parts than conventional autos -- they have no exhaust system, no transmission, no fuel system -- and require fewer workers to produce them. G.M., Ford and Stellantis have started building battery plants with joint-venture partners, which are not automatically covered by the U.A.W.'s labor contract.
The union has organized a G.M. battery plant in Ohio, but workers there must negotiate their wage rates and terms separately from the main U.A.W. agreement.
"Electrification presents problems," said Earl Fuller Jr., the G.M. chairman at Local 160 in Warren, Mich. "We see jobs going away, and that needs to be addressed."
While investing heavily in E.V.s, the automakers are still generating substantial profits off sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, helped by near-record prices of new vehicles. Over the last 10 years, G.M. and Ford have typically made a pretax profit of $ 7 billion to $ 11 billion a year in North America. Stellantis, the smallest of the three, has usually earned somewhat less, although its pretax results in the region topped $ 13 billion in 2021 and 2022.
Mr. Shaiken said the union had considerable leverage in the negotiations. "The stakes are very high for the auto manufacturers with this E.V. transition taking place," he said. "A strike could be very costly for the companies."
In his estimation, a strike is likely but not certain.
The automakers maintain that they bear a disadvantage in labor costs. According to Ford, its hourly cost of U.A.W. labor is $ 64, and it estimates that is $ 9 more than the labor cost for foreign-owned automakers with nonunion plants in the United States, and $ 14 to $ 19 more than that of Tesla, which also uses nonunion workers.
In a statement, Ford noted that it had 57,000 hourly U.A.W. workers, more than its two Detroit rivals, and that it produced more vehicles in the United States than the others as well.
"We look forward to working with the U.A.W. on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive work force more than ever," the company said.
Stellantis said it aimed to negotiate a contract that ensured its future competitiveness as well as good wages and benefits. "Together, we must approach these negotiations with open minds," the automaker said.
In the past, G.M., Ford and Stellantis have often lost money, or made little. Each needed concessions from the union to survive, and the union steadily agreed to many of the automakers' demands in a series of contracts beginning in 2003.
The cost of health care for U.A.W. retirees has been shifted from the automakers to a union trust fund. The union agreed to allow the manufacturers to start new hires at about half the $ 32 hourly rate that veteran workers earn. New workers get 401(k) accounts for retirement instead of guaranteed pensions. While the manufacturers have been paying substantial profit-sharing bonuses -- sometimes more than $ 10,000 for each worker -- the U.A.W. has gone without cost-of-living adjustments that in the past protected workers from inflation.
In contract talks four years ago, the union sought to regain ground on those issues. The automakers agreed to increases in hourly wages and profit-sharing, improved terms for temporary workers and modified wage tiers but stopped short of scrapping them for a single wage rate.
Workers at G.M. also demanded that the company reverse a plan to close a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, and went on strike for 40 days but ended up ratifying a contract that allowed the shuttering of the plant.
The 2019 contract did include provisions for G.M. to invest $ 3 billion in its plant in Detroit, which had also been designated for possible closing. The money was used to convert the site into G.M.'s flagship E.V. plant, now called Factory Zero, which produces an electric Cadillac S.U.V. as well as the electric GMC Hummer.
Margaret Hudgins-Washington, 56, a battery operator at the plant, was one of several dozen who stopped to talk to Mr. Fain on Wednesday. She has worked there for about a year, makes about $ 16 an hour and wants to see an end to the two-tier wage structure.
"Our workers have regressed with inflation," she said. "So I think we need better pay."
She and many others uniformly endorsed Mr. Fain's tougher approach.
"I think he's doing the right thing," said Kevin Winston, an electrician and a father of five from Brownstown, Mich. "Now is the time. I'm ready to strike, 100 percent, and I haven't heard any people say we shouldn't strike."

Rate Hawk at the Fed Will Take a Post at Purdue
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, who pushed for aggressive interest rate increases to curb high inflation, will leave his position next month to join Purdue University's business school. Bullard, who has led the St. Louis Fed since 2008 and is the Fed's longest-serving current policymaker, will stay on in an advisory role at the regional bank until Aug. 14 before taking up a post. He will not take part in the policy deliberations or the rate-setting decision at the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting this month, according to a statement from the St. Louis Fed. Bullard was in the vanguard of Fed policymakers calling for action to rein in a surge in inflation in the run-up to the launch of the Fed's tightening campaign in March 2022, and has maintained a hawkish posture in his public pronouncements. He will leave the Fed as it moves toward the endgame of its tightening cycle. REUTERS

Threatened UPS Strike Could Be Among Costliest
A threatened U.S. strike at United Parcel Service could be "one of the costliest in at least a century," topping $ 7 billion for a 10-day work stoppage, a think tank specializing in the economic impact of labor actions said on Thursday. That estimate from Michiganbased Anderson Economic Group includes UPS customer losses of $ 4 billion and lost direct wages of more than $ 1 billion. A 15-day strike in 1997 disrupted the supply of goods, cost the world's biggest parcel delivery firm $ 850 million and sent some customers to rivals like FedEx. Roughly 340,000 union-represented UPS workers handle about a quarter of U.S. parcel deliveries and serve virtually every city and town in the nation. A strike could delay millions of daily deliveries, including Amazon.com orders, electronic components and lifesaving prescription drugs, shipping experts warned. Talks are deadlocked between UPS and the Teamsters union, which has vowed to strike if a deal is not ratified before midnight on July 31. REUTERS

Exxon Pipeline Purchase Features Carbon Capture
Exxon Mobil is buying the pipeline operator Denbury, the beneficiary of changes in U.S. climate policy that intended to reduce the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. The all-stock deal is valued at $ 4.9 billion. Carbon capture and storage involves removing carbon dioxide, either from the source of pollution or from the air at large, and storing it deep underground. In some instances, the carbon dioxide is transported across states through pipelines and stored at facilities and used for other things. The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law last year by President Biden infuses nearly $ 375 billion over the decade in climate change-fighting strategies that could cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030, including carbon capture operations. Exxon said Thursday the acquisition gives it the largest owned and operated carbon dioxide pipeline network in the U.S. at 1,300 miles. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Thomas Abreu, 25, was charged with the murder of Hamod Ali Saeidi, an 86-year-old immigrant from Yemen who was out for his daily stroll in Queens.
A man who drove a scooter through Queens, firing randomly at people on the street, was charged on Sunday with the murder of an 86-year-old man during the half-hour shooting spree, the police said.
The man, Thomas Abreu, 25, of Brooklyn, was charged with killing Hamod Ali Saeidi, of Queens, according to the police.
Mr. Abreu has also been charged with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon in two other incidents: the firing of shots at a group of people near 108 Street and Jamaica Avenue on Saturday and at a 40-year-old man about four miles away, the police said.
The motive for the attacks remained unclear on Sunday.
Video from a security camera of the fatal shooting on Jamaica Avenue near 109th Street shows an assailant, who is on a scooter, slowly drive up to the 86-year-old man. The video, obtained by The Daily News, then shows the assailant raise a gun, point it at the man's back and fire.
The man turns around as if startled before bending over, his shirt stained with blood.
The police are still investigating three other shootings on Saturday where three people were wounded. They took place over six miles from Brooklyn to Queens, and in each case witnesses said a man on a scooter opened fire.
Police officials said at a news conference on Saturday that the incidents -- including the fatal shooting of Mr. Saeidi -- were connected, and that the assailant was riding a Fly E-Bike without a license plate.
As of Sunday afternoon, Mr. Abreu had not been charged in the shootings where three people were wounded.
Mr. Abreu is expected to be arraigned in Queens on Sunday evening, according to a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney. Authorities have not released the names of the other victims.
Edward A. Caban, the acting police commissioner, said in the news conference on Saturday that the "violent sequence of events" required an urgent, expansive search to track down the shooter.
"We're all so grateful that this person is not out on our streets," Commissioner Caban said after the arrest.
Mr. Saeidi came to the United States from Sana'a, Yemen in 1962, searching for "a new life," said his son, Ahmed Alsaedi, 65, in an interview on Sunday.
He lived first in California, where he worked on a farm, then moved to New York City and opened grocery stores, according to his family. He retired from his real estate business 10 years ago. He had dreamed of returning one day to the small mountain village where he grew up and was planning a trip back to Yemen on July 17.
On Saturday morning, he left his home in Richmond Hill, Queens, a three-story gabled house with an Eid Mubarak flag hanging above the porch, for his daily ritual: a three- to-four mile walk around nearby Forest Park, then prayers at his mosque.
Later that day, Mr. Alsaedi got a call from his stepmother saying that his father was late.
They tried his phone, but there was no answer. Then, they received a call from a hospital.
The family later learned Mr. Saeidi, the father of three sons and three daughters, had been shot in the back on his way to the mosque.
"My heart is broken, my family is devastated," Mr. Alsaedi said. "We couldn't believe what happened. I need justice."
Random shootings in New York City are rare. In 2006, Matthew Colletta, a 34-year-old bricklayer with a long history of mental illness and erratic behavior, drove for six hours through Queens, shooting at red cars. He injured four people and killed Todd Upton, a 51-year-old UPS driver who had just dropped off his daughter at college. In 2022, Frank James wounded 10 people when he opened fire on a Brooklyn subway car. The police arrested him in Manhattan about 24 hours later. That same year, Andrew Abdullah was charged in the fatal shooting of Daniel Enriquez on a Q train.
Gun violence in the city, which spiked during the pandemic, has declined. Shootings dropped around 25 percent in the last six months compared with the same time period last year, Commissioner Caban said at a news conference last week. Those numbers include the first weeks of summer, when violent crime historically rises.
The attacks on Saturday began just after 11 a.m. when the police responded to a 911 call about a 21-year-old man shot in the left shoulder near the corner of Ashford Street and Arlington Avenue in Brooklyn, said Chief Joseph Kenny, an assistant chief at the police detective bureau, at the news conference. The man was taken to an area hospital and treated for his injuries.
Then, around 17 minutes later, the police received more 911 calls. This time they were about a man who had been shot around four miles away on Jamaica Avenue near 109th Street in the Richmond Hill neighborhood of Queens.
Officers rushed to the scene where they found Mr. Saeidi, the police said on Sunday. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.
While at the scene, the officers received an alert about another shooting one block away. Mr. Abreu had fired several rounds at a group of people near 108th Street and Jamaica Avenue, the police said on Sunday. No one was injured.
Eight minutes later, at 11:35 a.m., an assailant shot a third man one mile east at 126 Street and Hillside Avenue in Queens, the police said. The man, 44, who was shot in the face, was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in critical condition, Chief Kenny said.
A minute later, a 40-year-old man was almost struck by a bullet near the corner of 131st Street and Jamaica Avenue. Mr. Abreu was charged in that shooting. Then, at 11:37 a.m., a fourth man, 63, was shot in the right shoulder around eight blocks away. The man was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries.
The 63-year-old man was identified as Jorge Balseca by his wife, Maria Cecilia Balseca. She described him as a quiet "homebody" shot as he was crossing the street, on his way to run errands for the day.
The shooter did not say a word to her husband, who did not see the man who shot him, Ms. Balseca said.
"The police said it was a crazy man shooting people," Ms. Balseca, 66, said.
Mr. Balseca, who has lived in the same Jamaica neighborhood for 20 years, fell to the ground and was helped by an ice cream shop owner who knows him and his family. The shop owner called Ms. Balseca's daughter, and word quickly spread among Mr. Basleca's relatives, who rushed to the hospital.
"I thought he was dead," Ms. Balseca said in Spanish.
On Sunday, Mr. Balseca, a retired hazardous materials cleaner, remained in the hospital in stable condition.
"We were in shock," Ms. Balseca said. "We never thought something like this would happen to him. He doesn't even go out at night."
It soon became clear the incidents were connected, and the police began a search for the assailant, collecting witness accounts and security video to trace the path of the shooter, Chief Kenny said on Saturday.
At 1:10 p.m., about two hours after the first shooting, officers arrested Mr. Abreu at the corner of Sutphin Boulevard and 94th Avenue in Queens. The police found a 9-millimeter pistol and an extended magazine inside the scooter, Chief Kenny said.
Waseem Saeidi, Mr. Saeidi's 38-year-old grandson, said he was supposed to go with his grandfather to Yemen.
Had he survived, his grandfather would have forgiven the shooter, the younger Mr. Saeidi said.
"Me," he said. "I don't forgive him."

Looming Strike Spurs Supply Chain Woes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Businesses around the country are facing what could be the latest disruption to how they get their goods to their customers in a timely and affordable fashion.
Kathryn Keeler and her husband, Stuart de Haaff, own an olive oil company in the hills of central California. The couple spend their days harvesting olives, bottling the oil, labeling the glass bottles and shipping them out, relying primarily on UPS to get their product to kitchens throughout the United States.
They are far from alone. UPS handles about a fourth of packages shipped each day in the United States, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index, many of them for small businesses like Ms. Keeler's company, Rancho Azul y Oro.
But with the labor contract between UPS and 325,000 of its workers expiring at the end of the month and a potential strike looming, business owners around the country are facing what could be the latest in a series of supply chain disruptions they have confronted since the start of the pandemic.
Some are pre-emptively turning to FedEx, the next largest private carrier in the United States, or the Postal Service. Others are calling their third-party shippers -- firms that work with the likes of UPS, FedEx and DHL to handle their clients' shipping needs -- to ensure that their packages can still get to their final destinations even if there is a strike.
The logistical challenge is just one more burden on businesses that have been stretched thin over the past few years.
"Maybe a larger business can withstand those types of situations," Ms. Keeler said. But as small-business owners, she and her husband "don't have a lot of extra time in our day to be on the phone with the post office or FedEx."
Since 2020, the pandemic has strained the global supply chain in a number of ways. E-commerce reached record levels as stuck-at-home Americans bought clothes, furniture, workout equipment and groceries online. Companies had to navigate Covid-related shutdowns at factories in China and Vietnam. There were worldwide delays when a large container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, leading to containers piling up at the Port of Los Angeles. Those situations affected the way goods came into the United States.
A UPS strike could hobble the way brands move their wares domestically.
"This is something that affects us on our home turf, and how do we solve for that?" said Ron Robinson, the chief executive of BeautyStat Cosmetics, which uses UPS to ship its skin care products to retailers like Ulta and Macy's.
One strategy that his team will lean on is trying to bundle packages, sending as many as it can out at once, he said.
Switching to another carrier is going to cost some companies.
Ryan Culver, the chief executive of Platterful, a monthly charcuterie board subscription service, also uses UPS. Switching over to FedEx Express -- necessary to ensure that the meats in his packages reach consumers in time -- would cost about $ 5 to $ 10 more per delivery.
Teri Johnson, the founder of Harlem Candle Company, received an email on June 26 from her third-party shipper about a potential UPS strike. It suggested she switch to FedEx. That will cost her about $ 2 extra for each candle shipped in the greater New York area. Sending her candles to California will cost even more.
"We don't really have a choice right now," Ms. Johnson said.
FedEx said it was accepting additional volume for a limited time and would assess how much capacity its network could accommodate. "Shippers who are considering shifting volume to FedEx, or are currently in discussions with the company to open a new account, are encouraged to begin shipping with FedEx now," the company said in a post on its website on Thursday.
The Postal Service said in an emailed statement that it "has a strong network, and we have the capacity to deliver what is tendered to us."
Larger companies are relying on sophisticated backup plans that have been tested over the past few years. The pandemic and previous tariff trade wars pushed many major retailers with global supply chains to diversify the countries where their vendors are and the parcel carriers they use.
"We've been focused on investing in a lot of transportation solutions that allow us to more nimbly move freight between carriers," said Alexis DePree, the chief supply chain officer at Nordstrom. "We can do that with a lot more flexibility and speed than we were able to in the past."
Some third-party carriers are seeing a boost in their businesses as the possibility of a UPS strike comes into focus for their clients. Stord, a third-party logistics and technology provider based in Atlanta whose clients include apparel makers and consumer-package companies, has been sending emails out telling its clients not to worry. Stord uses a cloud-based platform to offer services like warehousing and fulfillment and handles tens of thousands of their packages a day.
By combining the volume of its broad portfolio of client brands and using software to make decisions, Stord has the leverage to better negotiate prices with the large parcel carriers, said Sean Henry, the company's chief executive.
"We've been negotiating with FedEx and U.S.P.S. about rates around UPS so our customers don't have to do that," he said.
Stord said more of its clients had asked it to negotiate with carriers on their behalf. He said that equated to "tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue" for his business.
Still, some business owners are not letting the possibility of a UPS strike stress them out just yet.
Bill McHenry, president of Widgeteer, which sells cookware to large retailers, said he felt "kind of numb" after navigating the pandemic-related challenges. "I've seen a lot of stuff and the stories that I've heard and things we've had to go through and survive -- not just the pricing but the upheaval of thinking you have a container but don't," he said.
He said the potential rail strike last December had been a bigger concern for him.
In the meantime, the possibility that a deal could be reached between UPS and the union that represents its workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, remains. The union announced on Wednesday that negotiations had broken down, after previously saying the sides had reached a tentative agreement. If an agreement is not reached, a strike could happen as early as Aug. 1.
If that occurs, "we would be collateral damage," Ms. Keeler said.

After Rally, Wall Street Takes a Breather: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street edged lower Wednesday following a rally that had sent it roaring 16 percent higher for the year so far.
The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to drift lower from its highest level since April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.2 percent.
Other markets around the world fell more sharply after the latest discouraging signal from China's economy. Growth in China's services industry slowed by more than economists expected last month. It's the latest evidence that the world's second-largest economy is stumbling in its recovery following the removal of anti-Covid restrictions.
The U.S. economy has remained stronger than many investors feared, defying predictions for a recession because of a job market that has remained remarkably solid despite much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation.
A report on Wednesday showed growth for U.S. factory orders held steady in May, although economists had expected to see an acceleration.
Hope is rising that inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to soon stop its interest rate increases, which undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy. At its last meeting, the Fed decided to hold rates steady, the first time in more than a year that it refrained from hiking rates.
Some Fed officials wanted to raise rates at that last meeting, according to minutes from the June meeting released Wednesday. The vote was unanimous, though, to hold the federal funds rate steady within a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, up from virtually zero early last year.
Much of Wall Street expects the Fed to raise rates later this month. Less certain is whether a second hike will hit by the end of the year, as the Fed has been hinting. In the end, that may not matter much, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
"The move from zero to 5 percent is all that matters," he said. "The Fed has either gone too far and damaged the economy, and we just haven't seen it yet, or they haven't.
"We'll see that in due time," he added, saying that one or two more increases of a quarter of a percentage point won't have that much of an impact by themselves.
That could leave the U.S. stock market stuck in a holding pattern as everyone waits to see if the long-predicted recession happens. The upcoming earnings reporting season could offer some clues, with companies telling investors how much profit they earned during the spring.
Mr. Mayfield said he is particularly interested to hear from companies that sell directly to consumers to see whether the main pillar holding up the U.S. economy is weakening at all.
Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.94 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, held steady at 4.94 percent.
On Wall Street, shares of UPS fell 2.1 percent as the company tried to reach a deal with the Teamsters union representing about 340,000 of its workers. Their current contract expires at the end of the month, and Teamsters members last month voted in favor of a strike authorization.
Companies that do a lot of business in the China region were also weak. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, which get significant chunks of revenue from Macau, both fell at least 4.6 percent.
On the winning side was Meta Platforms. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is poised to unveil a new app that appears to mimic Twitter. It rose 1.9 percent, adding to a stellar year where it has already soared 144.6 percent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes slumped 1.6 percent in Hong Kong and 0.7 percent in Shanghai after discouraging economic data from China.

Major Trucking Company Faces Possible Bankruptcy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Three years after receiving a pandemic relief loan, the trucking company Yellow has repaid little of the money and is warning that it could soon run out of cash.
A beleaguered trucking business that received a $ 700 million pandemic-era loan from the federal government may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection this summer amid a dispute with its union, a development that could leave American taxpayers stuck with a failed company.
The financial woes at the business, Yellow, which previously went by the name YRC Worldwide, have been building for years. The company lost more than $ 100 million in 2019 and has more than $ 1.5 billion in outstanding debt, including the government loan. In 2022, YRC, which ships meal kits, protective equipment and other supplies to military bases, agreed to pay $ 6.85 million to settle a federal lawsuit that accused it of defrauding the Defense Department.
In 2020, the Trump administration, which had ties to the company and its executives, agreed to give the firm a pandemic relief loan in exchange for the federal government assuming a 30 percent equity stake in the company.
Three years later, Yellow is on the verge of going bankrupt.
Since receiving the loan, the company has changed its name, restructured its business and seen its stock price plummet. As of the end of March, Yellow's outstanding debt was $ 1.5 billion, including about $ 730 million that is owed to the federal government. Yellow has paid approximately $ 66 million in interest on the loan, but it has repaid just $ 230 of the principal owed on the loan, which comes due next year.
On Tuesday, Yellow sued the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for blocking the company's restructuring plan and accused the union of causing more than $ 137 million in damages. The company said that it was taking "immediate steps to try to save itself" and that the union was trying to "cause Yellow's economic ruin."
The company's financial plight is the latest example of how some of the trillions of dollars pumped out quickly during the pandemic were misdirected, mismanaged or obtained fraudulently. Federal watchdogs and government agencies have expressed alarm at signs of fraud and failing loans.
The office of the special inspector general for pandemic recovery, an independent agency within the Treasury Department that scrutinizes some of the relief money, warned last month that it was seeing an "alarming rate of defaults by borrowers who are failing to pay even the interest payments on the loans." The office warned that the number of defaults on pandemic loans could increase over the next two years as payments come due.
On Tuesday, the inspector general for the U.S. Small Business Administration, which disbursed about $ 1.2 trillion in pandemic loans, said in a report that over $ 200 billion, or 17 percent, of the money was disbursed to "potentially fraudulent actors."
Yellow's loan enabled the company to stay afloat for a while and embark on a restructuring plan. But economic headwinds and a fight with the Teamsters union over the terms of a new contract have put Yellow in a precarious financial position.
In May, the company reported a first quarter loss of $ 54.6 million and Moody's downgraded its credit rating out of concern about its dispute with the union. Yellow's stock price has fallen by more than 70 percent to $ 0.99 a share over the past year.
The company has warned union officials that the standoff is putting Yellow's fate at risk. Union officials claim that the company is being mismanaged and that the concessions it is seeking are unfair.
"Yellow has been unable to effectively manage itself for a long time -- now the company says that it will be out of money by August," Sean O'Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said in a video message broadcast on Facebook to Yellow union members this month. "These executives have no idea what they are doing, they have driven this company into the ground."
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. O'Brien said that the allegations in Yellow's lawsuit were "unfounded and without merit" and said that the company's management failed its work force by being unable to live up to the terms of their contract.
The union's current contract expires next year. The main points of contention are over whether hundreds of Yellow truckers would have to start loading and unloading freight at docks and a proposal that would give the company more power over where truckers have to work. Yellow needs the union to agree to the next stage of its restructuring plan so that it can seek additional financing and repay its debts.
The company said that it still intended to repay the loan that it received from the government and that it was negotiating in good faith and trying to save the jobs of its 30,000 workers.
"Yellow is engaging with all stakeholders in Washington and remains determined to negotiate a contract with the I.B.T. that works for employees, customers and shareholders," Darren Hawkins, chief executive of Yellow, said, referring to the union. "Protecting 30,000 jobs is Yellow's top priority.
In the lawsuit, Yellow said that it had sought the Biden administration's assistance in brokering a deal to save the company but that the White House's efforts were rebuffed by the union. The lawsuit says that Yellow had contacted Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for help and claimed that Mr. Sanders's office said it was not interested in helping because Yellow was awarded the loan by the Trump administration.
The White House acknowledged it had discussions with Yellow and the union but declined to weigh in further on the matter.
"Our administration has been in touch with both parties, but we're not going to comment on a legal dispute," Michael Kikukawa, a White House spokesman, said. "The loan in question was provided by the Trump administration."
Mr. Sanders's office did not respond to a request for comment. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said that the agency continued to monitor loans made through pandemic recovery programs during the prior administration.
The Treasury Department also holds nearly 30 percent of Yellow's common stock and the loan is secured by the company's assets. If Yellow declares bankruptcy and has to liquidate, the U.S. government will take over much of the company's trucking fleet and real estate holdings.
Yellow's loan, which was awarded as part of the $ 2.2 trillion pandemic relief legislation that Congress passed in 2020, had raised questions of cronyism from the beginning.
A report last year produced by Democratic staff of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis found that the money had been doled out over the objections of career officials at the Defense Department and suggested that senior Trump administration officials had intervened to ensure that Yellow received special treatment despite concerns about its eligibility to receive relief funds. In addition to deep ties to the Trump administration, the company, which for years faced legal and financial troubles, also had a strong lobbying presence in Washington.
Although it is questionable whether Yellow is critical to national security, it is one of the largest freight trucking companies in the United States and its downfall would have a ripple effect across the nation's supply chain.
UPS and ABF Freight have also been engaged in negotiations with the Teamsters over their contracts, amplifying uncertainty across the sector.
Chris Spear, chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, urged the union and Yellow to work with a federal mediator on a new contract to make sure that the company does not go bankrupt.
"It's going to seriously impact the economy and the supply chain," Mr. Spear said. "Capacity is already tight."
Bruce Chan, a transportation analyst at the investment bank Stifel, said the shuttering of Yellow would lead to significant increases in the costs of shipping in the United States and force firms to find other carriers for their "homeless" freight. He noted that vulnerable trucking companies had been struggling under the pressure of changing consumer demand, which has shifted toward services and away from goods.
Although Yellow has found ways to survive financial troubles in the past, Mr. Chan likened the current union dispute to "squeezing blood from a stone."
"It looks pretty tough for them," he said.

UPS Workers Authorize Union to Call Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A walkout is possible after the contract for more than 325,000 workers expires this summer. Negotiations began in April but have yet to resolve pay.
United Parcel Service workers have authorized their union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to call a strike as soon as Aug. 1, after the current contract expires, the Teamsters announced Friday.
The Teamsters represent more than 325,000 UPS employees in the United States, where the company has nearly 450,000 employees overall. The union said 97 percent had voted in favor of strike authorization.
Many unions hold such votes to create leverage at the bargaining table, but a much smaller percentage end up following through. "The results do not mean a strike is imminent and do not impact our current business operations in any way," UPS said in a statement, adding that it was "confident that we will reach an agreement."
A UPS strike could have significant economic fallout. The company handles about one-quarter of the tens of millions of parcels shipped each day in the United States, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. And while UPS's competition has grown in recent years, rivals would be hard-pressed to replace that lost capacity quickly, leaving some customers in the lurch and others facing higher costs.
"What happens when you try to stuff 25 percent more food into a stomach that's 90 percent full?" said Alan Amling, a fellow at the University of Tennessee's Global Supply Chain Institute and a former UPS executive.
The two sides have reached tentative agreements on a number of issues since they began negotiating a national contract in April, most recently on heat safety, including a requirement for air conditioning in new trucks beginning in January and additional fans and venting for existing trucks.
But the negotiators have yet to tackle pay increases, which the Teamsters say are overdue amid the company's strong pandemic-era performance. The company's adjusted net income increased by more than 70 percent from 2019 to last year.
The union has also focused on revisiting pay disparities for a category of driver who typically works on weekends.
The UPS chief executive, Carol Tomé, who started in that position in 2020, said on a recent earnings call that UPS was aligned with the union on "several key issues." She added that outsiders should not put too much stock in the "great deal of noise" that was likely to arise during the negotiation.
Looming over the talks is the political standing of the Teamsters' leader, Sean O'Brien, who during his campaign for the union's presidency in 2021 repeatedly accused his predecessor, James P. Hoffa, of being overly conciliatory toward employers.
Mr. O'Brien complained that Mr. Hoffa had essentially forced a concessionary contract onto UPS workers in 2018 after union members voted down the deal. He criticized his opponent for the presidency, a Hoffa-aligned candidate, for being unlikely to strike.
"You already conceded that in your 25-year career, you only struck six times, so UPS knows you're not going to strike," Mr. O'Brien said at a candidates' debate.
Mr. O'Brien has largely maintained his aggressive stance on UPS since taking over as president last year. Speaking in October to activists with Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a reformist group that backed his candidacy, Mr. O'Brien vowed that "this UPS agreement is going to be the defining moment in organized labor."
Compensation for UPS drivers is generally higher than pay at the company's competitors. UPS said that the average full-time delivery driver with four years' experience makes $ 42 an hour, and that part-time workers who sort packages make $ 20 an hour on average after 30 days.
The groups receive the same benefits package, which includes health care and pension contributions and is worth about $ 50,000 a year for full-time drivers, the company says.
Beyond overall pay levels, the union has said it wants to eliminate a category of driver created under the 2018 contract.
The company said the category was intended for hybrid workers who performed jobs like sorting packages on some days while driving on other days, especially Saturdays, to address the growing demand for weekend delivery.
But the Teamsters said these workers never followed the hybrid arrangement and simply drove full time from Tuesday to Saturday, for less pay than other full-time drivers. The company says that the weekend drivers make about 87 percent of the base pay of regular full-time drivers, and that some employees have worked under a hybrid arrangement.
In the event of a strike, deliveries to consumers, such as e-commerce orders, would probably be among the first to be disrupted. But experts said the supply chain could suffer, too. Some suppliers would struggle to quickly ship goods like automotive parts to manufacturers, potentially causing production slowdowns.
Even a short strike could take a toll on UPS. Many customers long relied exclusively on the company, but that started to change after the Teamsters last went on strike in 1997, Mr. Amling said. After that strike, which lasted just over two weeks, more customers began to work with multiple carriers. The consequences were masked by gains from the rise of e-commerce and fewer competitors to choose from, but the company may not be so fortunate today.

MOSCOW, Idaho — In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a doctorate student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that Kohberger had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took more than six weeks — weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the killings. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as “targeted” and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, authorities eventually backtracked.
“We cannot say that there is no threat to the community,” police Chief James Fry said at a news conference Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the FBI to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home’s back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners’ addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a doctorate in criminology.
They checked Kohberger’s car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Goncalves’ car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims’ house from 3 to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims’ bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on UPS delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Goncalves’ account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account holders, including their locations, credit card information and any “private images, pictures or videos” associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“You couldn’t get one warrant to search 19 houses,” he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area — including one in Idaho and two in Washington state — while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Kohberger’s name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for breadcrumbs.
“You could say this is uncharted territory,” Kerr said. “They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there.”
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the FBI’s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites’ data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
“That is why the Idaho case is so interesting,” she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
FBI personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university 8 miles from the scene of the killings.
Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Kohberger’s cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks — perhaps turned off — in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Kohberger’s family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against the original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whomever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30.
“We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe,” the police chief, Fry, announced. “But we still do need to be vigilant, right?”

Amazon Is Everywhere, and That Makes It Vulnerable: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For years, the e-commerce giant could shield its vast archipelago of warehouses against disruptions from workers. Then it got even bigger.
Is there a more familiar sign of corporate dominance than the Amazon delivery van?
As recently as four years ago, the blue-gray vehicle with the smiley arrow was a relative novelty among fleets of brown and blue-and-white delivery trucks clogging the streets. Today, the Amazon vans are almost inescapable. Between 2020 and 2022, their numbers more than doubled, to roughly 100,000.
But this symbol of Amazon's strength may hint at something else: an underappreciated vulnerability.
The vans are just the most visible piece of ‌the company's vast delivery network. When you place an order for cat toys or razor blades or vacuum bags, Amazon employees typically pluck them off a shelf in a warehouse, then ship them to a succession of buildings, known as sort centers and delivery stations, where they are grouped by destination and loaded onto vans.
The system, which also includes planes and air hubs, has enabled ever-faster delivery, according to data from NIQ (NielsenIQ). It has also made Amazon susceptible to a potent form of labor organizing -- choke point organizing -- in which workers threaten to hobble a company's operations by shutting down key sites, known as choke points.
In September 2019, workers at an Amazon delivery station in Sacramento began campaigning for paid personal time off, which many part-time employees in such buildings lacked. With no progress on their demands, the workers walked off their shifts just before Christmas, and the campaign gained momentum at delivery stations in Chicago and New York. In March 2020, Amazon announced that it was providing a paid-time-off benefit that affected more than 10,000 part-time employees at buildings nationwide.
While it is rare for employees to pry loose costly concessions from Amazon, workers who threaten choke points within its delivery network appear to have won concessions multiple times.
Following walkouts over pay and working conditions at two Chicago delivery stations just before Christmas 2021, hundreds of Chicago-area workers received raises of about $ 2 an hour. After about half of the roughly 1,500 employees at an air hub in San Bernardino, Calif., submitted a petition seeking higher pay last summer, Amazon raised hourly wages for night workers by nearly a dollar. The workers had discussed striking, and dozens later walked out.
Amazon said it made changes to wages, paid time off and other policies on its own, unrelated to the activities of small groups of workers. "Nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our teams," said Lisa Levandowski, an Amazon spokeswoman.
But experts argue that the organizing has gotten results. Choke point organizers "have had some success building worker power, challenging the boss, getting some gains," said Jake Alimahomed-Wilson, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, and an editor of the book "Choke Points: Logistics Workers Disrupting the Global Supply Chain."
Amazon's recent growth helped create the choke points that workers have sought to exploit. During its first two decades, the company stayed out of the delivery business and simply handed off your cat toys and razor blades to the likes of UPS, FedEx and the Postal Service.
Amazon began transporting many of its own packages after the 2013 holiday season, when a surge of orders backed up UPS and other carriers. Later, during the pandemic, Amazon significantly increased its transportation footprint to handle a boom in orders while seeking to drive down delivery times. Hence all those new vans.
The problem is that shipping networks are fragile.
If workers walk off the job at one of Amazon's traditional warehouses, the fulfillment center, the business impact is likely to be minimal because the sheer number of warehouses means orders can be easily redirected to another one.
But a shipping network has far less redundancy. If one site goes down, typically either the packages don't arrive on time or the site must be bypassed, often at considerable expense. All the more so if the site handles a huge volume of packages.
"That's truly a position of vulnerability," said Marc Wulfraat, president of MWPVL International, a supply-chain consulting firm, referring to Amazon's largest air hub, in Kentucky.
And as Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, seeks to drive down shipping times further, the disruptive potential of this kind of organizing may be growing.
"Part of the opportunity here to organize has to do with their airfreight operation being a real choke point," said Griffin Ritze, a driver at the Kentucky hub, where workers have started a union campaign.
Amazon said that its transportation network, including the Kentucky hub, could withstand short-term disruptions with little effect on customers, but that longer disruptions could create inefficiencies and higher costs.
Ms. Levandowski added that the company had invested billions in raising pay and improving training, safety and benefits since the start of the pandemic, but that it knew "there will always be more to do."
Heirs to the 'sit-down' strike
On the evening of Dec. 30, 1936, a local leader of the fledgling United Automobile Workers flashed a red light outside the union's office, across from a massive General Motors plant in Flint, Mich., summoning the plant's shop stewards. As plant conditions had deteriorated -- not least, the grueling "speed-up" that required some workers to make thousands of hand motions per hour -- the union decided it was time to strike for recognition. When the stewards returned to the plant, employees stopped working and refused to leave.
The so-called sit-down strike at the Flint plant and another in Cleveland nearly paralyzed the company because they were known as mother plants: the sole producers of many parts for G.M. assembly plants. After several tense weeks, G.M., which had been hostile to unions, recognized the U.A.W.
But it would not soon forget its vulnerability to strikes. As the sociologists Joshua Murray and Michael Schwartz observed in their book "Wrecked: How the American Automobile Industry Destroyed Its Capacity to Compete," General Motors and other U.S. automakers spent the next few decades dispersing production across a much wider number of plants. Thereafter, Mr. Murray and Mr. Schwartz wrote, "even if the union mobilized enough workers to shut an entire plant down, the companies now had the option of ramping up production at one of the parallel plants."
Amazon has moved in a different direction from the automakers in the last century -- in some ways making itself more vulnerable, not less, as its business has ballooned.
According to data from MWPVL International, the consulting firm, a small portion of Amazon fulfillment centers ship an extremely high volume of goods -- more than one million items a day during last year's peak period -- including JFK8, the Staten Island warehouse where workers voted to join the Amazon Labor Union last spring.
If a union strikes and shuts down one of those buildings, "there will be penalties to pay" for Amazon even with its redundant capacity, said Mr. Wulfraat, MWPVL International's president. He cited higher transportation costs and possible shipping delays. Amazon said the operational impact would be minimal.
More precarious is the company's delivery infrastructure, where such extensive redundancy is impractical.
For example, Amazon also operates dozens of so-called sort centers, where often more than 100,000 packages a day are grouped by geographic area. Many metro areas the size of Albuquerque or St. Louis have only one or two such centers, and a metro area as large as Chicago has only four.
If one went down, Mr. Wulfraat said, Amazon could be forced to reroute packages to sort centers in other cities, raising costs. "You couldn't just call up UPS and say: 'Tomorrow, we're going to dump 200,000 packages into your lap. Is that problem?' They don't have the bandwidth." To get a sense of what this could cost, consider that FedEx spent hundreds of millions of dollars on such rerouting in 2021.
Some workers hope to take advantage. After organizers at a sort center on Staten Island lost a vote on whether to unionize last year, they focused on building enough support to force a shutdown at the building, which sorts packages for 15 delivery stations in the New York area.
"It's not enough to get someone to go and vote yes," said Madeline Wesley, a worker involved in the organizing. "What we're going for here is a fundamental shift in the power dynamics."
Delivery stations, where sort centers send packages so they can be loaded onto vans, can be similarly vulnerable. In the fall of 2021, the company declined to increase pay for many workers in the Chicago area.
"We were told our pay was reviewed in September of 2021 and there would be no raise," said Ted Miin, a worker involved in organizing at a delivery station there.
But shortly after workers at two delivery stations in the area walked off the job that December, the company increased pay for workers in those buildings by about $ 2 per hour. "It was pretty clear to us that our walkouts were what won us the raise," Mr. Miin said.
Amazon said that the group was merely claiming credit for Chicago-area pay adjustments the company had begun making on its own, and that it had taken similar steps at locations where there was no organizing.
There are several reasons a walkout at a delivery station can be effective.
Unlike Amazon's large fulfillment centers, which typically employ thousands, delivery stations range from a few dozen employees to a few hundred, and the workers tend to be in closer contact.
"Work in a delivery station is more social," said Charmaine Chua, an expert on logistics and labor organizing at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "That can overcome significant problems with fulfillment centers, of the work being isolated."
(One exception: fulfillment centers that draw workers from tightknit communities, like one near Tijuana, Mexico, and another near the Somali community in Minnesota, where workers appear to have won concessions in recent years.)
While mobilizing hundreds of workers at a fulfillment center may be daunting, a walkout of several dozen delivery station workers could delay tens of thousands of packages that are supposed to end up on vans by late morning.
And a longer shutdown at one delivery station could take a toll on other buildings.
"It's not like the I.T. world, where there are multiple redundant systems -- one server goes down, and another pops up," said Chris Freimann, a former manager at a St. Louis-area delivery station. "When one goes down, the others feel the impact of it. The margin of error gets very, very tight."
Amazon denied this, saying it had the capacity to reallocate packages to other delivery stations with little disruption.
'Where is Sara?'
On the last Friday in December, Amazon suspended a San Bernardino air hub employee, Sara Fee, who has helped organized co-workers at the site.
The next week, workers wore "Hello, my name is" stickers on which they wrote, "Where is Sara?" They discussed plans to strike if Ms. Fee was fired. The company asked her to return to work by the end of the week.
There is arguably no bigger target for organizers at Amazon than the company's air hubs, which it uses to move more than one million packages each day across large distances. The San Bernardino hub is one of a handful that increasingly form the backbone of the company's air transit system.
This appears to have given workers leverage. In addition to asking Ms. Fee to return this winter, the company announced that it was raising the hourly wage for night shifts by nearly $ 1 last August -- a significant bump in addition to last year's nationwide pay increase. This was after about half the hub's roughly 1,500 employees added their names to a petition seeking higher pay.
Amazon said it had brought Ms. Fee back after investigating reports that she yelled at a manager. In response to that allegation, Eli Naduris-Weissman, a lawyer who represents Inland Empire Amazon Workers United, a group organizing workers at the site, said Ms. Fee was an outspoken leader who had suffered retaliation after complaining about being targeted by Amazon.
The company's facility at the Cincinnati airport in northern Kentucky, which is known as KCVG, is the largest of the hubs. At its 2019 groundbreaking, the company founder, Jeff Bezos, declared, "We're going to move Prime from two-day to one-day, and this hub is a big part of that." Then he exhorted, "Let's move some earth!" and mounted a John Deere front loader.
The number of employees at the Kentucky hub (now well over 2,000) and the number of flights has grown substantially since the facility opened almost two years ago. The Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University estimates that the number of Amazon Air flights in or out of KCVG on a typical day more than doubled between early 2022 and early 2023, to over 50.
Amazon said the institute's reports, which rely on public data, drew inaccurate conclusions but did not dispute the trend in Kentucky. The company said it also continued to ship some packages through UPS and the Postal Service.
Labor organizing has accompanied the increased activity. In September, managers at KCVG told workers that they would receive a small raise -- ranging from 50 cents to about $ 1 an hour, depending on seniority.
Several employees said they had been expecting a "peak" season bonus of at least $ 2 an hour, which they received the previous year. Some who work on the ramp, where planes are loaded and unloaded, left in frustration after the announcement.
"There are usually around 50 tug drivers," said Mr. Ritze, a driver involved in the organizing, referring to the trucks that move large containers across the facility. "It went down to 20. Everyone else left, took P.T.O."
Not long after, a group of organizers submitted a petition with the names of roughly 300 workers asking the company to restore the peak bonus and make it permanent. Members of the group later announced that they were seeking to unionize.
Management didn't budge on the bonus, but canceled the first week of mandatory extra time, in which employees work up to 60 hours a week between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
The site's director of operations, Adrian Melendez, said that Amazon had opted for a smaller pay increase that was permanent rather than a larger increase that was temporary, and that most workers understood the rationale. The company said it had canceled a week of mandatory overtime because enough workers had volunteered.
At their spare campaign office near the airport on a morning in February, a handful of union backers said that frustration over the small raise had initially gotten them involved, but that other issues, like safety, also loomed large.
The effort, funded in part by members of the left-wing group Socialist Alternative, appears to have attracted more attention from Amazon recently. After the Amazon Labor Union president, Christian Smalls, appeared in Kentucky in March to offer the union's support, the company began regularly holding meetings for workers in which it dwelled on the drawbacks of unionizing, according to a recording of one of the meetings.
"Like many other companies, we hold these meetings because it's important that everyone understands the facts about joining a union and the election process," said Ms. Levandowski, the Amazon spokeswoman.
Workers may not even need to win a union election in Kentucky in order to extract concessions from the company.
During each shift, dozens of tug drivers move hundreds of package containers, known as cans, between the warehouse and the planes. If the tugs don't move, neither do the packages.
The company clearly understands the stakes: Workers say managers frequently urge employees who aren't tug drivers to become "tug-trained" so they can operate tugs in the event of a driver shortage. Amazon said that it was common to cross-train workers and that managers provided support and coaching to employees if the tugs got backed up.
The drivers are aware of their power, too. And many support the union effort.
"Any time there's a delay, it's always blamed on the tug drivers -- management doesn't take any responsibility for it," said Steven Kelley, another worker active in the campaign. "That's honestly why most of them are in favor."
If enough tug drivers got fed up and simply refused to move, Mr. Kelley added, "it would shut the whole operation down."

Is there a more familiar sign of corporate dominance than the Amazon delivery van?
As recently as four years ago, the blue-gray vehicle with the smiley arrow was a relative novelty among fleets of brown and blue-and-white delivery trucks clogging the streets. Today, the Amazon vans are almost inescapable. Between 2020 and 2022, their numbers more than doubled, to roughly 100,000.
But this symbol of Amazon’s strength may hint at something else: an underappreciated vulnerability.
The vans are just the most visible piece of the company’s vast delivery network. When you place an order for cat toys or razor blades or vacuum bags, Amazon employees typically pluck them off a shelf in a warehouse, then ship them to a succession of buildings, known as sort centers and delivery stations, where they are grouped by destination and loaded onto vans.
The system, which also includes planes and air hubs, has enabled ever-faster delivery, according to data from NIQ (NielsenIQ). It has also made Amazon susceptible to a potent form of labor organizing — chokepoint organizing — in which workers threaten to hobble a company’s operations by shutting down key sites, known as chokepoints.
In September 2019, workers at an Amazon delivery station in Sacramento, California, began campaigning for paid personal time off, which many part-time employees in such buildings lacked. With no progress on their demands, the workers walked off their shifts just before Christmas, and the campaign gained momentum at delivery stations in Chicago and New York. In March 2020, Amazon announced that it was providing a paid-time-off benefit that affected more than 10,000 part-time employees at buildings nationwide.
Although it is rare for employees to pry loose costly concessions from Amazon, workers who threaten chokepoints within its delivery network appear to have won concessions multiple times.
After walkouts over pay and working conditions at two Chicago delivery stations just before Christmas 2021, hundreds of Chicago-area workers received raises of about $2 an hour. After about half of the roughly 1,500 employees at an air hub in San Bernardino, California, submitted a petition seeking higher pay last summer, Amazon raised hourly wages for night workers by nearly a dollar. The workers had discussed striking, and dozens later walked out.
Amazon said it made changes to wages, paid time off and other policies on its own, unrelated to the activities of small groups of workers. “Nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our teams,” said Lisa Levandowski, an Amazon spokesperson.
But experts argue that the organizing has gotten results. Chokepoint organizers “have had some success building worker power, challenging the boss, getting some gains,” said Jake Alimahomed-Wilson, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, and an editor of the book “Choke Points: Logistics Workers Disrupting the Global Supply Chain.”
Amazon’s recent growth helped create the chokepoints that workers have sought to exploit. During its first two decades, the company stayed out of the delivery business and simply handed off your cat toys and razor blades to the likes of UPS, FedEx and the Postal Service.
Amazon began transporting many of its own packages after the 2013 holiday season, when a surge of orders backed up UPS and other carriers. Later, during the pandemic, Amazon significantly increased its transportation footprint to handle a boom in orders while seeking to drive down delivery times. Hence all those new vans.
The problem is that shipping networks are fragile.
If workers walk off the job at one of Amazon’s traditional warehouses — the fulfillment center — the business impact is likely to be minimal because the sheer number of warehouses means orders can be easily redirected to another one.
But a shipping network has far less redundancy. If one site goes down, typically either the packages don’t arrive on time or the site must be bypassed, often at considerable expense. All the more so if the site handles a huge volume of packages.
“That’s truly a position of vulnerability,” said Marc Wulfraat, president of MWPVL International, a supply-chain consulting firm, referring to Amazon’s largest air hub, in Kentucky.
And as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy seeks to drive down shipping times further, the disruptive potential of this kind of organizing may be growing.
“Part of the opportunity here to organize has to do with their airfreight operation being a real chokepoint,” said Griffin Ritze, a driver at the Kentucky hub, where workers have started a union campaign.
Amazon said that its transportation network, including the Kentucky hub, could withstand short-term disruptions with little effect on customers, but that longer disruptions could create inefficiencies and higher costs.
Levandowski added that the company had invested billions in raising pay and improving training, safety and benefits since the start of the pandemic, but that it knew “there will always be more to do.”
Heirs to the ‘Sit-Down’ Strike
On the evening of Dec. 30, 1936, a local leader of the fledgling United Automobile Workers flashed a red light outside the union’s office, across from a massive General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan, summoning the plant’s shop stewards. As plant conditions had deteriorated — not least, the grueling “speedup” that required some workers to make thousands of hand motions per hour — the union decided it was time to strike for recognition. When the stewards returned to the plant, employees stopped working and refused to leave.
The so-called sit-down strike at the Flint plant and another in Cleveland nearly paralyzed the company because they were known as mother plants: the sole producers of many parts for GM assembly plants. After several tense weeks, GM, which had been hostile to unions, recognized the UAW.
But it would not soon forget its vulnerability to strikes. As sociologists Joshua Murray and Michael Schwartz observed in their book “Wrecked: How the American Automobile Industry Destroyed Its Capacity to Compete,” GM and other U.S. automakers spent the next few decades dispersing production across a much wider number of plants. Thereafter, Murray and Schwartz wrote, “even if the union mobilized enough workers to shut an entire plant down, the companies now had the option of ramping up production at one of the parallel plants.”
Amazon has moved in a different direction from the automakers in the past century — in some ways making itself more vulnerable, not less, as its business has ballooned.
According to data from MWPVL International, a small portion of Amazon fulfillment centers ship an extremely high volume of goods — more than 1 million items a day during last year’s peak period — including JFK8, the warehouse on New York City’s Staten Island where workers voted to join the Amazon Labor Union last spring.
If a union strikes and shuts down one of those buildings, “there will be penalties to pay” for Amazon even with its redundant capacity, said Wulfraat. He cited higher transportation costs and possible shipping delays. Amazon said the operational impact would be minimal.

Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business in November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $110 to $140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance — about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $9 a week.
“I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive,” said Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Missouri, just east of Kansas City. “But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate.”
In the auto industry’s transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of EVs were up 45% from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual EV sales total in the U.S. market to top 1 million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don’t need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge. One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in.
Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning. Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don’t need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don’t burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet, commercial EVs have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Startups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a startup backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and GM, two of the country’s largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford’s Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or as a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the U.S. Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
GM created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022 and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.
Along with the truck, BrightDrop has developed an electric cart to enable drivers to haul many packages from the truck, reducing the number of trips the driver makes back and forth. One version of the cart is refrigerated for deliveries of produce and groceries.
In Hooksett, New Hampshire, Merchants Fleet, a company that manages vehicles used by delivery services, has been using 150 BrightDrop vans over the past year and is eager to add more.
Brad Jacobs, the company’s vice president for fleet consulting, said the depreciation cost and the cost of interest on the capital used to buy electric vans were roughly the same as for combustion engine trucks.
“What we’ve learned from the vehicles on the road is that you save anywhere from $10,000 to $12,000 a year because the cost of fuel and maintenance is so much lower with electric vehicles,” he said. “If a company is planning on service life of five years, that’s a savings of $50,000 per vehicle. That’s very compelling.”
Merchants Fleet has orders for 750 more BrightDrop trucks and reservations on an additional 17,000, Jacobs said.
Large delivery companies have been clamoring for electric trucks for years. Amazon hopes to buy as many as 100,000 vans from Rivian and is considering an electric Ram ProMaster van that Chrysler’s parent company, Stellantis, is supposed to start making this year.
UPS has ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a startup company based in Luxembourg that has operations in Britain. Arrival has suffered financial troubles and production delays. FedEx plans to buy only battery-powered vans starting in 2030 and hopes to operate an all-electric fleet by 2040. It has been testing 150 BrightDrop trucks, is taking delivery on 350 more and has reservations for an additional 2,000.
Nelson Granados, a FedEx delivery driver in Inglewood, California, has been using a BrightDrop vehicle for the past year, a white van with the orange-and-purple FedEx logo next to a picture of a bright green plug and electric cord.
Granados gives the truck a thumbs-up. The truck has comforts the diesel vans lack like a stereo and heated seats, as well as a lower floor that makes entering and leaving easier.
“You’re getting in and out all day, so it pays off,” Granados said. “It’s like a luxury delivery truck.”
Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games — he has season tickets — so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he’s reaping from the E-Transit.
“When I look at the cost over five years,” he said with a laugh, “it’s almost like getting a free van.”

Earnings Bring Gloom to the Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street tumbled Tuesday to its worst day in a month on worries about the strength of corporate profits and the economy following some mixed reports.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent to break out of a weekslong lull. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite sank 2 percent.
First Republic Bank had the biggest loss in the S&P 500 by far, and its stock nearly halved after it said customers withdrew more than $ 100 billion during the first three months of the year. That doesn't include $ 30 billion in deposits that big banks plugged in to build faith in their rival after the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history shook confidence.
The size of the drop in deposits renewed worries about the U.S. banking system and the risk of an economy-sapping pullback in lending. That overshadowed First Republic's beating analysts' expectations for earnings at the start of the year, and its stock plunged 49.4 percent.
The majority of companies so far this reporting season have been topping expectations, but the bar was set considerably low. Analysts are forecasting the worst drop in S&P 500 earnings since the spring of 2020, when the pandemic froze the global economy. That's why Wall Street is focused just as much, if not more, on what companies say about their future prospects as they do about their past three months.
UPS fell 10 percent after it met profit forecasts but said it made less in revenue than expected. It also said its revenue for the full year will likely come at the low end of its prior forecast, citing a challenging economy and other factors.
Danaher was another big weight on the market, falling 8.8 percent despite reporting better earnings and revenue than expected. Analysts pointed to its trimming back its forecast for a key revenue measure over the course of the year.
On the winning side, PepsiCo rose 2.3 percent after beating profit expectations. Shares of the home builder PulteGroup rose 1.7 percent after the company also topped forecasts.
The heart of earnings reporting season is approaching, and more heavy hitters arrived after trading closes for the day.
Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, both rose in after-hours trading after reporting profits above expectations. Because they're two of the biggest companies on Wall Street by market value, their stock movements carry extra weight on the S&P 500 and other market indexes.
Broad stock indexes had been making only modest moves so far this earnings reporting season. The S&P 500 barely budged last week and ticked up just 0.1 percent on Monday. But volatility strategists at Barclays said the calm was unlikely to last long.
The economy is under stress from high interest rates meant to get inflation under control. High rates can stifle inflation, but only by putting the brakes on the entire economy and hurting investment prices. Big chunks of the economy outside the job market have already begun to slow or contract.
With so much uncertainty about whether inflation can return to the Federal Reserve's target without causing a recession, "we remain skeptical that markets are out of the woods," Barclays strategists led by Stefano Pascale said in a report. They also pointed to "the risk of something breaking" in the financial system because of high rates.
A report on Tuesday showed that confidence among consumers fell more sharply in April than expected, down to its lowest level since July. That's a discouraging signal when consumer spending makes up the biggest part of the U.S. economy.
A separate report was more encouraging, saying sales of new homes rose by more than expected. The housing industry has been under pressure because higher mortgage rates are squeezing buyers.

They Know Your Face, Maybe Not Your Name: [Science Desk]

Full text: The people at the dog park, the bank teller, the regular waiter -- these casual relationships may be "weak ties," but they're also a key to well-being.
Victoria Tirondola and Lam Gong first struck up a conversation last spring at the dog run in Brookdale Park in Bloomfield, N.J., when they realized that each owned a dog named Abby. Ms. Tirondola, 65, an insurance sales representative who lives in nearby Cedar Grove, has a tiny bichon-poodle mix. Mr. Gong's Abby, older and portlier, is a terrier-beagle.
They chatted about dogs at first. Then they learned that they both cooked, so "we talked about food and restaurants," said Mr. Gong, 67, a retiree living in Clifton.
"And how much better my cooking is than his," put in Ms. Tirondola. They were sitting on a bench, as the dogs dashed around on a warm spring afternoon, with a third member of a growing collection of regulars: Pattie Marsh, dog walker for a miniature Australian shepherd named Ollie.
"All of us live alone," Ms. Tirondola said. "My mom just passed away in July, and we were very close. Lam lost his wife a few years ago."
"It gives us companionship" to meet at the Bark Park, said Ms. Marsh, 55. She and Ms. Tirondola, who bonded as born-again Christians, come daily. Mr. Gong joins them once or twice a week. So does Lee Geanoules, 69, a part-time restaurant server from Clifton, who soon arrived with Charlie, a pug and beagle blend.
Psychologists and sociologists call these sorts of connections "weak ties" or "peripheral ties," in contrast to close ties to family members and intimate friends. Some researchers investigating weak ties include in that category classmates, co-workers, neighbors and fellow religious congregants. Others look into interactions with near-strangers at coffee shops or on transit routes.
People who cross paths at the dog run, for instance, may recognize other regulars without knowing their names (though they probably know their dogs' names) or anything much about them. Nevertheless, impromptu chats about pets or the weather often arise, and they're important.
Such seemingly trivial interactions have been shown to boost people's positive moods and reduce their odds of depressed moods. "Weak ties matter, not just for our moods but our health," said Gillian Sandstrom, a psychologist at the University of Sussex in England who has researched their impact.
"If I asked who you confided in, you wouldn't mention them," she said. Yet the resulting sense of belonging that weak ties confer is "essential to thriving, feeling connected to other people" -- even among introverts, which is how Dr. Sandstrom defines herself.
In her early studies, hand-held clickers were distributed to groups of undergraduate students and people over 25 to track how many classmates or others they interacted with, however minimally, over several days. Those who interacted with more weak ties reported greater happiness, and a greater sense of well-being and belonging, than those with fewer interactions.
The researchers found "within-person differences," too, showing that the effects were not a result of personalities. The same individuals reported being happier on days they had more interactions. Other studies found similar benefits when people smiled and undertook brief conversations with baristas at a Starbucks in Vancouver, British Columbia, or greeted university shuttle bus drivers in Ankara, Turkey.
Most of these participants were quite young, but one study, published in 2020, followed an older sample of more than 800 adults in metropolitan Detroit over 23 years.
The researchers asked subjects (average age at the start: 62) to draw three concentric circles, with "you" in the center, and to arrange people in their lives by degree of closeness. Those in the innermost circle of close ties were almost always family, said Toni Antonucci, a psychologist at the University of Michigan and senior author of the study. The weak ties in the outermost circle included friends, co-workers and neighbors.
Over time, the number of weak ties more strongly predicted well-being than the number of close ties. Weak ties "provide you with a low-demand opportunity for interaction," Dr. Antonucci said. "It's cognitively stimulating. It's engaging."
The Covid pandemic, striking when social scientists were already raising alarms about the health risks of loneliness and isolation for older adults, suspended many of these everyday exchanges.
Seniors often kept in touch with their families, one way or another, but where were the waiters who knew their breakfast orders, the bank tellers, crossing guards and dog walkers? "I hope it made people realize how much weak ties matter," Dr. Sandstrom said. Though they can't replace close ones, "we missed the novelty and the spontaneity," she said.
At older ages, when social networks tend to shrink, people may have to work at expanding them. "Make the effort," Dr. Antonucci advised. "You can't create new children at 70, but you can create new weak ties."
Ilze Earner, 67, retired last year after 25 years of teaching at Hunter College in Manhattan. Life in rural Claverack, N.Y., had its satisfactions and friendships, but after a few months, "I started feeling like I was missing something," she said. She began taking herself to lunch weekly, sitting at the bar at the nearby Chatham House.
Soon, the bartender had learned her name (and vice versa) and of her love of lobster rolls. Ms. Earner won a bar-top game of ice cube bocce against the highway crew who also came in for lunch. "They noticed when I disappeared because I had a knee replacement, and when I came back it was, 'Hey, bionic woman!"' she recalled. "It's nice."
In Placerville, Calif., David Turoff, 72, a veterinarian, chats with his mail carrier and UPS deliveryman, and sometimes drops in on the mechanic who repairs his truck just to say hello or leave a gift of firewood. "They make me feel good," Mr. Turoff said of such brief interactions. "I like having connections with people."
Toby Gould's day begins with a 7 a.m. visit to Chez Antoine, a bakery and coffee shop in Hyannis, Mass. Mr. Gould, 77, a retired minister, buys a takeout latte and speaks French, haltingly, with the Belgian proprietor, who bestows a slice of ham on Mr. Gould's Australian shepherd, Layla. If the shop closed, "it would leave a hole in my life," Mr. Gould said.
Weak ties, including those developed online, don't necessarily turn into close ones and don't have to. Close relationships, after all, can involve conflicts, demands for reciprocity and other complications.
But sometimes, weak ties do evolve.
The Brookdale Park dog owners, for instance, have become real friends. They go out to dinner together and see movies and comedy shows. In bad weather, they walk in a local mall. Mr. Gong, who is handy, hung curtains for Ms. Tirondola and shellacked cabinets for Ms. Geanoules; he gave Ms. Marsh a ride home when she left her car at a garage for repairs.
A bit hesitant at first to exchange phone numbers, "we took a giant step," Ms. Geanoules said, pausing to pat and coo at one of the Abbys. "You can change a lifetime by talking to someone for 10 minutes."

A Porn Actress, a Payoff, and Trump on the Brink: [National Desk]

Full text: Manhattan prosecutors investigating a payout to Stormy Daniels may be poised to make Donald J. Trump the first former president ever to be criminally indicted.
At the time, it all was more tawdry than momentous. A reality star invited a porn actress half his age to a hotel room after a round in a celebrity golf tournament. She arrived in a spangly gold dress and strappy heels. He promised to put her on television and then, she says, they slept together.
Yet the chain of events flowing from the 2006 encounter that the adult film star, Stormy Daniels, has said she had with the television personality, Donald J. Trump, has led to the brink of a historic development: the first criminal indictment of a former American president.
The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has signaled he is preparing to seek felony charges against Mr. Trump; Mr. Bragg is expected to accuse him of concealing a $ 130,000 hush-money payment that Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's lawyer and fixer, made to Ms. Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election.
A conviction would be likely to hinge on prosecutors' proving that Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen and falsified business records when he did so, possibly to hide an election law violation.
It would not be a simple case. Prosecutors are expected to use a legal theory that has not been assessed in New York courts, raising the possibility that a judge could throw out or limit the charges. The episode has been examined by both the Federal Election Commission and federal prosecutors in New York; neither took action against Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump has denied having sex with Ms. Daniels and said he did nothing wrong. The former president, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the White House, has made it clear that he will cast the indictment as a political "witch hunt" and use it to rally his supporters. On Saturday, he predicted he would be arrested on Tuesday and called for protests.
The prosecutors' chief witness would be Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations in August 2018, admitting he helped arrange the Daniels payment -- and another to a former Playboy model -- to aid Mr. Trump's presidential bid at the behest of Mr. Trump.
An indictment would mark another extraordinary episode in the Trump era: The former president -- whose tenure closed with a riot at the Capitol, who tried to overturn a fair election and who is under investigation for failing to return classified material -- may face his first criminal charge for paying off a porn star.
A Lake Tahoe encounter
Ms. Daniels, born Stephanie Gregory and raised mostly in a ramshackle ranch house in Baton Rouge, La., was 27 in July 2006, when she met Mr. Trump, then 60, at the celebrity golf tournament in Nevada.
As a child, she wrote in her 2018 memoir, "Full Disclosure," she felt ashamed and motivated after overhearing a friend's father refer to her as "white trash." Attracted by the money she could make, Ms. Daniels started as an exotic dancer even before she finished high school, working at a local joint called Cinnamon's. At 23, she began acting in pornographic movies and soon married the first of her four husbands: Bartholomew Clifford, who directed adult films under the name "Pat Myne."
When he met Ms. Daniels, Mr. Trump had largely transitioned from real estate mogul to reality star; he had traveled to the tournament without his third wife, Melania, who remained behind with their newborn son. Mr. Trump and Ms. Daniels crossed paths on the golf course and later in the gift room, where they were photographed together at a booth for her porn studio, Wicked Pictures. He invited her to dinner.
As they chatted that night in Mr. Trump's penthouse at Harrah's Lake Tahoe -- she has said he wore black silk pajamas and slippers -- he told her that she should be on "The Apprentice," an NBC reality show. She doubted he could make it happen. He assured her he could, she said.
Afterward, he would phone her occasionally from a blocked number, calling her "Honeybunch." They saw each other at least twice more in 2007, at a launch party for the short-lived Trump Vodka and at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where they watched "Shark Week." But they did not sleep together again. And Mr. Trump never put her on "The Apprentice." Still, he kept calling, she has said. Eventually, she stopped answering.
Selling stories
Since 2000, Mr. Trump had staged long-shot presidential runs that more resembled publicity stunts than serious bids for office. He kicked off another in 2011, promoting conspiracy theories that then-President Barack Obama had been born outside the United States. As he did so, Ms. Daniels, still bitter, began working with an agent to see if she could sell the story of their liaison.
They negotiated a $ 15,000 deal with Life & Style, a celebrity magazine, telling its reporter that Ms. Daniels believed Mr. Trump's offer to make her a contestant had been a lie, according to a transcript later published online.
"Just to impress you, to try to sleep with you?" the reporter asked. "Yeah," Ms. Daniels responded. "And I guess it worked."
When the magazine contacted the Trump Organization for comment, Michael Cohen returned the call. A lawyer who had joined the company four years earlier, Mr. Cohen had become Mr. Trump's fixer, diving headlong into resolving thorny problems for his boss and the Trump family. Mr. Cohen threatened to sue, the magazine killed the story, and Ms. Daniels did not get paid.
Mr. Trump, for his part, dropped out of the race and continued hosting "The Apprentice."
That October, Ms. Daniels's story about Mr. Trump surfaced briefly after her agent leaked it to a gossip blog called "The Dirty," trying to gin up interest from a paying publication. A couple of media outlets followed up, but none offered payment. Ms. Daniels denied the story, and her agent had a lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif., Keith Davidson, get the post taken down.
As Mr. Obama prepared to leave office in 2015, Mr. Trump decided to run for president once more. That August, he sat in his office at Trump Tower with Mr. Cohen and David Pecker, the publisher of American Media Inc. and its flagship tabloid, The National Enquirer.
Mr. Pecker, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's, had used The Enquirer to boost Mr. Trump's past presidential runs. He promised to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and negative ones about opponents, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Pecker also agreed to work with Mr. Cohen to find and suppress stories that might damage Mr. Trump's new efforts, a practice known as "catch and kill."
In spring 2016, Ms. Daniels attempted through her agent to sell her story again -- this time for more than $ 200,000. But the publications she approached all passed, including The Enquirer.
Around the same time, Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, began exploring how to monetize her own tale of sleeping with Mr. Trump. Ms. McDougal, Playboy's 1998 Playmate of the Year, has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump starting in 2006, when she was 35. They had spent time together in his Trump Tower apartment and at the same golf tournament where Ms. Daniels encountered him. But Ms. McDougal ended the relationship in 2007, she has said. Mr. Trump has denied the affair.
In 2016, with her modeling career flagging, Ms. McDougal hired Mr. Davidson, the same lawyer who had helped Stormy Daniels remove the 2011 blog post.
The lawyer approached The Enquirer's editor, Dylan Howard, about buying Ms. McDougal's story, and Mr. Howard and Mr. Pecker both briefed Mr. Cohen, three people with knowledge of the discussions have said. In late June, Mr. Trump personally appealed to Mr. Pecker for help in keeping Ms. McDougal quiet, according to an account Mr. Pecker gave federal prosecutors.
But the tabloid did nothing until Ms. McDougal was about to give an interview to ABC News. In early August, American Media agreed to pay Ms. McDougal $ 150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story about Mr. Trump, camouflaging the real purpose of the deal by guaranteeing she would appear on two magazine covers, among other things, five people familiar with the events have said.
American Media would later admit, in a deal to avoid federal prosecution, that the principal purpose of the agreement was to suppress Ms. McDougal's story, which the company had no intention of publishing.
Stormy Daniels, meanwhile, still had not found any takers for her story. Her luck changed in early October.
'It could look awfully bad'
The news hit the presidential race like a bomb. On Oct. 7, 2016, The Washington Post published what would become known as the "Access Hollywood" tape, in which Mr. Trump, unwittingly on a live microphone, was recorded describing in lewd terms how he groped women.
The people surrounding Stormy Daniels immediately realized that Mr. Trump's new vulnerability made her more of a threat -- and thus gave her story value. Mr. Davidson, the Los Angeles lawyer, was also friendly with Ms. Daniels's agent, Gina Rodriguez, and with The Enquirer's editor, Mr. Howard. On the day after the "Access Hollywood" tape emerged, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Howard texted about the damage it had done to Mr. Trump's campaign. Then Mr. Howard asked Ms. Daniels's agent to send another pitch for his boss, Mr. Pecker.
The Enquirer executives alerted Mr. Cohen; Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Pecker for help containing it.
Mr. Howard haggled with Ms. Daniels's agent, but when he presented Mr. Pecker with an offer to buy the story for $ 120,000, the publisher refused.
"Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there," Mr. Howard wrote.
That night, Mr. Cohen spoke by phone to Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard, according to records obtained by federal authorities. Mr. Howard connected him to the lawyer, Mr. Davidson, who would negotiate the deal for Ms. Daniels.
Three days after the "Access Hollywood" tape's release, Mr. Cohen agreed to pay $ 130,000 in a deal that threatened severe financial penalties for Ms. Daniels if she ever spoke about her affair with Mr. Trump. The contract used pseudonyms: Peggy Peterson, or "P.P.," for Ms. Daniels, and David Dennison, or "D.D.," for Mr. Trump. Their identities were revealed only in a side letter.
Ms. Daniels signed her copy on the trunk of a car near a porn set in Calabasas, Calif. Mr. Cohen signed on Mr. Trump's behalf.
But Mr. Cohen delayed paying. He has said he was trying to figure out where to get the money while Mr. Trump campaigned. According to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump had approved the payment and delegated to him and the Trump Organization's chief financial officer the task of arranging it. They considered options for funneling the money through the company, Mr. Cohen said, but did not settle on a solution.
Ms. Daniels began to believe that Mr. Trump was trying to stall until after the Nov. 8 election; if he lost, her story would lose its value. In mid October, after Mr. Cohen had blown two deadlines, Ms. Daniels's lawyer canceled the deal, and the porn actress again began shopping the story. The next week, Mr. Howard texted Mr. Cohen that if Ms. Daniels went public, their work to cover up the sexual encounter might also become known.
"It could look awfully bad for everyone," Mr. Howard wrote.
Mr. Cohen agreed to make the payment himself. He spoke briefly by phone with Mr. Trump, twice. Then he transferred about $ 130,000 from his home equity line of credit into the account of a Delaware shell company and wired it to Ms. Daniels's lawyer.
Mr. Davidson circulated a new hush-money agreement. Ms. Daniels signed and notarized it at a UPS store near a Walmart Supercenter in Forney, Texas, near her home.
"I hope we are good," Mr. Cohen texted Mr. Davidson afterward.
"I assure you we are very good," the lawyer replied.
Ms. Daniels remained silent. A week and a half later, Mr. Trump won the election.
Once he was in the White House, Mr. Trump handled one more piece of business related to Stormy Daniels. He signed checks to reimburse Mr. Cohen for paying her off.

At the time, it all was more tawdry than momentous. A reality star invited a porn actress half his age to a hotel room after a round in a celebrity golf tournament. She arrived in a spangly gold dress and strappy heels. He promised to put her on television and then, she says, they slept together.
Yet the chain of events flowing from the 2006 encounter that the adult film star, Stormy Daniels, has said she had with the television personality, Donald Trump, has led to the brink of a historic development: the first criminal indictment of a former U.S. president.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has signaled he is preparing to seek felony charges against Trump; Bragg is expected to accuse him of concealing a $130,000 hush-money payment that Michael D. Cohen, Trump’s lawyer and fixer, made to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election.
A conviction would be likely to hinge on prosecutors’ proving that Trump reimbursed Cohen and falsified business records when he did so, possibly to hide an election law violation.
It would not be a simple case. Prosecutors are expected to use a legal theory that has not been assessed in New York courts, raising the possibility that a judge could throw out or limit the charges. The episode has been examined by both the Federal Election Commission and federal prosecutors in New York; neither took action against Trump.
Trump has denied having sex with Daniels and said he did nothing wrong. The former president, who is seeking the 2024 Republican nomination for the White House, has made it clear that he will cast the indictment as a political “witch hunt” and use it to rally his supporters. On Saturday, he predicted he would be arrested Tuesday and called for protests.
The prosecutors’ chief witness would be Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations in August 2018, admitting he helped arrange the Daniels payment — and another to a former Playboy model — to aid Trump’s presidential bid at the behest of Trump.
An indictment would mark another extraordinary episode in the Trump era: The former president — whose tenure closed with a riot at the Capitol, who tried to overturn a fair election and who is under investigation for failing to return classified material — may face his first criminal charge for paying off a porn star.
A Lake Tahoe Encounter
Daniels, born Stephanie Gregory and raised mostly in a ramshackle ranch house in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was 27 in July 2006, when she met Trump, then 60, at the celebrity golf tournament in Nevada.
As a child, she wrote in her 2018 memoir, “Full Disclosure,” she felt ashamed and motivated after overhearing a friend’s father refer to her as “white trash.” Attracted by the money she could make, Daniels started as an exotic dancer even before she finished high school, working at a local joint called Cinnamon’s.
At 23, she began acting in pornographic movies and soon married the first of her four husbands: Bartholomew Clifford, who directed adult films under the name “Pat Myne.”
When he met Daniels, Trump had largely transitioned from real estate mogul to reality star; he had traveled to the tournament without his third wife, Melania, who remained behind with their newborn son. Trump and Daniels crossed paths on the golf course and later in the gift room, where they were photographed together at a booth for her porn studio, Wicked Pictures. He invited her to dinner.
As they chatted that night in Trump’s penthouse at Harrah’s Lake Tahoe — she has said he wore black silk pajamas and slippers — he told her that she should be on “The Apprentice,” an NBC reality show. She doubted he could make it happen. He assured her he could, she said.
Afterward, he would phone her occasionally from a blocked number, calling her “Honeybunch.” They saw each other at least twice more in 2007, at a launch party for the short-lived Trump Vodka and at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where they watched “Shark Week.” But they did not sleep together again. And Trump never put her on “The Apprentice.” Still, he kept calling, she has said. Eventually, she stopped answering.
Selling Stories
Since 2000, Trump had staged long-shot presidential runs that more resembled publicity stunts than serious bids for office. He kicked off another in 2011, promoting conspiracy theories that then-President Barack Obama had been born outside the United States. As he did so, Daniels, still bitter, began working with an agent to see if she could sell the story of their liaison.
They negotiated a $15,000 deal with Life & Style, a celebrity magazine, telling its reporter that Daniels believed that Trump’s offer to make her a contestant had been a lie, according to a transcript later published online.
“Just to impress you, to try to sleep with you?” the reporter asked. “Yeah,” Daniels responded. “And I guess it worked.”
When the magazine contacted the Trump Organization for comment, Cohen returned the call. A lawyer who had joined the company four years earlier, Cohen had become Trump’s fixer, diving headlong into resolving thorny problems for his boss and the Trump family. Cohen threatened to sue, the magazine killed the story, and Daniels did not get paid.
Trump, for his part, dropped out of the race and continued hosting “The Apprentice.”
That October, Daniels’ story about Trump surfaced briefly after her agent leaked it to a gossip blog called “The Dirty,” trying to gin up interest from a paying publication. A couple of media outlets followed up, but none offered payment. Daniels denied the story, and her agent had a lawyer in Beverly Hills, California, Keith Davidson, get the post taken down.
As Obama prepared to leave office in 2015, Trump decided to run for president once more. That August, he sat in his office at Trump Tower with Cohen and David Pecker, the publisher of American Media Inc. and its flagship tabloid, The National Enquirer.
Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump’s, had used The Enquirer to boost Trump’s past presidential runs. He promised to publish positive stories about Trump and negative ones about opponents, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Pecker also agreed to work with Cohen to find and suppress stories that might damage Trump’s new efforts, a practice known as “catch and kill.”
In spring 2016, Daniels attempted through her agent to sell her story again — this time for more than $200,000. But the publications she approached all passed, including The Enquirer.
Around the same time, Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, began exploring how to monetize her own tale of sleeping with Trump. McDougal, Playboy’s 1998 Playmate of the Year, has said she had an affair with Trump starting in 2006, when she was 35. They had spent time together in his Trump Tower apartment and at the same golf tournament where Daniels encountered him. But McDougal ended the relationship in 2007, she has said. Trump has denied the affair.
In 2016, with her modeling career flagging, McDougal hired Davidson, the same lawyer who had helped Daniels remove the 2011 blog post.
The lawyer approached The Enquirer’s editor, Dylan Howard, about buying McDougal’s story, and Howard and Pecker both briefed Cohen, three people with knowledge of the discussions have said. In late June, Trump personally appealed to Pecker for help in keeping McDougal quiet, according to an account Pecker gave federal prosecutors.
But the tabloid did nothing until McDougal was about to give an interview to ABC News. In early August, American Media agreed to pay McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story about Trump, camouflaging the real purpose of the deal by guaranteeing she would appear on two magazine covers, among other things, five people familiar with the events have said.
American Media would later admit, in a deal to avoid federal prosecution, that the principal purpose of the agreement was to suppress McDougal’s story, which the company had no intention of publishing.
Daniels, meanwhile, still had not found any takers for her story. Her luck changed in early October.
‘It Could Look Awfully Bad’
The news hit the presidential race like a bomb. On Oct. 7, 2016, The Washington Post published what would become known as the “Access Hollywood” tape, in which Trump, unwittingly on a live microphone, was recorded describing in lewd terms how he groped women.
The people surrounding Daniels immediately realized that Trump’s new vulnerability made her more of a threat — and thus gave her story value. Davidson, the Los Angeles lawyer, was also friendly with Daniels’ agent, Gina Rodriguez, and with The Enquirer’s editor, Howard. On the day after the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged, Davidson and Howard texted about the damage it had done to Trump’s campaign. Then Howard asked Daniels’ agent to send another pitch for his boss, Pecker.
The Enquirer executives alerted Cohen; Cohen asked Pecker for help containing it.
Howard haggled with Daniels’ agent, but when he presented Pecker with an offer to buy the story for $120,000, the publisher refused.
“Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there,” Howard wrote.
That night, Cohen spoke by phone to Trump, Pecker and Howard, according to records obtained by federal authorities. Howard connected him to the lawyer, Davidson, who would negotiate the deal for Daniels.
Three days after the “Access Hollywood” tape’s release, Cohen agreed to pay $130,000 in a deal that threatened severe financial penalties for Daniels if she ever spoke about her affair with Trump. The contract used pseudonyms: Peggy Peterson, or “PP,” for Daniels, and David Dennison, or “DD,” for Trump. Their identities were revealed only in a side letter.
Daniels signed her copy on the trunk of a car near a porn set in Calabasas, California. Cohen signed on Trump’s behalf.
But Cohen delayed paying. He has said he was trying to figure out where to get the money while Trump campaigned. According to Cohen, Trump had approved the payment and delegated to him and the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer the task of arranging it. They considered options for funneling the money through the company, Cohen said, but did not settle on a solution.
Daniels began to believe that Trump was trying to stall until after the Nov. 8 election; if he lost, her story would lose its value. In mid-October, after Cohen had blown two deadlines, Daniels’ lawyer canceled the deal, and the porn actress again began shopping the story. The next week, Howard texted Cohen that if Daniels went public, their work to cover up the sexual encounter might also become known.

His Wife Was Dying, but 10 Feet of Snow Stood in His Way

Two days into the relentless snowfall it became clear: There would be no leaving the mountains.
Robert Rice was initially unfazed by warnings of the impending storm. The 79-year-old had lived for more than four decades in the same home in Running Springs, a community tucked into the San Bernardino National Forest. Snow had often blanketed the landscape.
Although arthritis plagued his hands and knees, Rice was in good health, accustomed to walking a few miles every day at elevation with his Labrador retriever, Ranger. His garage held a generator and an extra canister of gasoline, the pantry was stocked with soup and chili. A Vietnam War combat veteran, he was not worried about hunkering down for a while.
But as flurries fell at a record pace, stacking high outside his windows, Rice received distressing news.
His wife, Ann Rice, was struggling to breathe. She had been on a ventilator for three years, but something had changed. Carbon dioxide was building up in her lungs, and doctors cautioned the end could be near. The skilled nursing facility where she lived was 27 miles away.
Ann Rice, 81, had long suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had also developed congestive heart failure. In December, when breast cancer invaded her body, she was in no shape for radiation or chemotherapy. The cancer spread to her bones.
Robert Rice visited her nearly every day.
The two had been together for 54 years, ever since meeting through a bowling league in Pasadena, California. He was a police officer at the time and tended to be stoic, while she was generous and gregarious — an extrovert who struck up conversations in the grocery aisle. They soon married in Las Vegas, raised three children and became known as an inseparable pair who liked to read in their matching brown recliners.
Now, with miles of snow between them, Robert Rice feared he would be unable to say a final goodbye.
It was one desperate situation of many that played out in the shadows of a record-breaking storm in Southern California. Beginning in late February, rain turned to days of ceaseless snow that trapped residents in the San Bernardino Mountains, in a region about 85 miles east of Los Angeles. Nearly 10 feet of snow would ultimately fall, causing roofs to cave and leaving many without power or access to food or help. Shovels and snowblowers were no match against what became a towering icy mass. The local Sheriff’s Office would end up responding to at least 13 deaths.
Residents whose homes were damaged have had little respite since, their troubles exacerbated by two atmospheric rivers over the last week that pounded the area with several inches of rain. The latest storm departed Wednesday after leaving a slushy mess in the mountain regions and flooding parts of California.
When last month’s snowstorm began, Robert Rice thought he could at least maintain a clear portion of the driveway that sloped down from the street and ran 50 feet to his attached garage.
“But it was snowing so hard, it just didn’t do any good,” he said. “It was almost like a blizzard condition; wind was blowing, and I just couldn’t keep up with it.”
Rice had been a paratrooper and sergeant in the Army for six years before becoming a police officer. For almost three decades he held a second job as a corporate security supervisor for UPS. He liked to take charge and lead. He did not like asking for help.
He had gotten word about his wife’s condition from his daughter Shelley Renison, who lived out of the snow’s reach in San Bernardino. By that time, Renison, her sister and her brother had gone to their mother’s bedside.
Their mother’s decline had been difficult to watch. Once able to get around with an oxygen tank, she now had a tracheal tube. About a year ago, she grew uninterested in using the valve attachment required to speak.
Robert Rice bought her a tablet so they could communicate through a messaging app. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he sat outside her window with a dry erase board, holding up bits of conversation. She replied with notes on her own board.
But about six months ago, Ann Rice appeared to lose awareness of her surroundings. She did not always recognize who visited. Her family lived for the rare moments when her eyes would suddenly focus and she smiled or mouthed, “I love you.” This had not happened for a while. And the family had recently agreed to a do-not-resuscitate order.
And so it seemed, on the last weekend of February, that Ann Rice would die with her three children around her but her husband far away.
“We just kind of came to accept the fact that he wasn’t going to be there, and we were trying to prepare him for that,” said Renison, a middle school vice principal and teacher. “He was in denial. He kept thinking he’d figure out a way to get himself down here.”
On Feb. 26, Robert Rice decided to dig a path up the driveway so that he might be able to walk to the street, which he couldn’t even see. The snow loomed above his head, near the edge of his roof.
He began hacking at the icy mass with a shovel, and then used the snowblower to try to clear what fell. He repeated the routine again and again, his fingers aching in the 25-degree chill.
But after two hours, sweaty and exhausted, he gave in. He had managed to scrape out only a 10-foot line.
“I looked out there and said, ‘There’s no way I’m getting out.’”
That evening, he received a call. Doctors had managed to find a way to help his wife dispel the carbon dioxide through her ventilator. It bought him some time.
Still, the days would continue with no solution to all of the clogged driveways and impassable roads. When the snow finally stopped, an eerie stillness came over the neighborhood. Social media posts revealed the hard truth. So many in the region were stuck at home.
Robert Rice passed the hours with episodes of “M*A*S*H” and “Dragnet” that he had thought to download before his satellite dish was buried. Luckily his power went out for only a short period. He called the nursing facility every day to check on his wife’s condition and constantly messaged his daughter for updates.
He and his wife had bought their butterscotch-colored two-story house in 1979 while it was still under construction. Ann Rice had walked inside and declared, “This is the place.”
She was the one who charmed the neighbors, offering rides to everyone’s kids. Quick-witted and playful, she endeared herself to customers while running the beloved Good Witch's Bakery at Santa’s Village, a nearby amusement park.
Robert Rice was more restrained, uncomfortable with displays of emotion.
Years of active duty had hardened him, he admitted. “I learned when I was overseas you don’t make really good friends because, my God, you might lose him or never see him again,” he said. In many ways he was drawn to his wife because of the light she seemed to exude.
After his wife moved out five years ago, he had refused to make any changes to their home, insisting that he needed her input. A part of him believed she would get better and come back.
By March 5, Robert Rice noticed the bay window in his living room was cracking from the weight of the snow. The only walkable area outside was the patio where Ranger had taken to relieving himself before rushing back indoors. There was still no conceivable way to get up the driveway.
A couple of friends eventually trudged over with shovels. But after a day of work, their efforts felt futile.
Then three days later, Robert Rice received word that his wife’s hemoglobin levels were dropping because of internal bleeding. She was already undergoing blood transfusions every other day. Nothing was helping.
The doctors recommended stopping intervention. Ann Rice could have six months left, they said. A handful of weeks was more likely.
Robert Rice tried to absorb what he heard. He opened a book to busy himself, but had an urgent and terrible feeling.
“I sat there and thought, ‘Oh my God, she’s going to die before I get there.’”
Then the tears came.
That’s when he decided to take a different approach. He went to his laptop and began to type.
“I never thought I would have to do this. Here goes,” he started. “My wife Ann is in a skilled nursing facility down the hill. She does not have long to go. I can’t even get down to say goodbye. Is there anyone who can help with my driveway. It’s about half done, needs to be wider so I can back my small car up . I’m a Army Vietnam veteran and retired LEO. This is very embarrassing for me to even ask for help. Sorry.”
He added his phone number, and then posted the plea on a local Facebook group.
“I was hoping that people wouldn’t think I sound corny,” he said. “There were other people who probably needed the help more than me.”
It did not take long before Robert Rice’s phone began to ring. Someone wanted to drop off food. A man offered to donate money for a hotel near his wife. One woman said she could ferry him to her in a Jeep. Firefighters stopped by for a wellness check. Five neighbors showed up at his front yard with shovels. Numerous people thanked him for his service. And many told him he should not feel embarrassed.
It was his longtime neighbor who appeared that day with the answer: a tractor with a front loader bucket purchased a few years ago for the winters. He could manage the roads because an agency had recently made a pass through the area with a plow. After three hours, a path had been carved out of Rice’s driveway.
On Thursday morning, March 9, Rice hopped in his Chevrolet Trax and began to back it out of the garage, but it soon scraped against the wall of snow. The path was still not wide enough. He spent another two hours broadening the opening.
Finally, he managed to get up onto the street. He eased down the mountain, flanked by giant snow berms that had created what felt like a one-way tunnel. Relief surged through his veins as he headed toward his wife.
When he arrived at her side, he reached out and clasped her hand. He smoothed her face and hair and told her how he had spent his days, how much he had missed her, loved her. How he wanted to make it to her before she slipped away.
Robert Rice could not tell whether his wife knew he was there. But he had heard that those close to death retained their hearing long after other senses gave out. Hopefully she knew at least that she was not alone.
He would be back tomorrow.

Full text: Two days into the relentless snowfall it became clear: There would be no leaving the mountains.
Robert Rice was initially unfazed by warnings of the impending storm. The 79-year-old had lived for more than four decades in the same home in Running Springs, a community tucked into the San Bernardino National Forest. Snow had often blanketed the landscape.
Although arthritis plagued his hands and knees, Mr. Rice was in good health, accustomed to walking a few miles every day at elevation with his Labrador retriever, Ranger. His garage held a generator and an extra canister of gasoline, the pantry was stocked with soup and chili. A Vietnam War combat veteran, he was not worried about hunkering down for a while.
But as flurries fell at a record pace, stacking high outside his windows, Mr. Rice received distressing news.
His wife, Ann Rice, was struggling to breathe. She had been on a ventilator for three years, but something had changed. Carbon dioxide was building up in her lungs, and doctors cautioned the end could be near. The skilled nursing facility where she lived was 27 miles away.
Ms. Rice, 81, had long suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had also developed congestive heart failure. In December, when breast cancer invaded her body, she was in no shape for radiation or chemotherapy. The cancer spread to her bones.
Mr. Rice visited her nearly every day.
The two had been together for 54 years, ever since meeting through a bowling league in Pasadena, Calif. He was a police officer at the time and tended to be stoic, while she was generous and gregarious -- an extrovert who struck up conversations in the grocery aisle. They soon married in Las Vegas, raised three children and became known as an inseparable pair who liked to read in their matching brown recliners.
Now, with miles of snow between them, Mr. Rice feared he would be unable to say a final goodbye.
It was one desperate situation of many that played out in the shadows of a record-breaking storm in Southern California. Beginning in late February, rain turned to days of ceaseless snow that trapped residents in the San Bernardino Mountains, in a region about 85 miles east of Los Angeles. Nearly 10 feet of snow would ultimately fall, causing roofs to cave and leaving many without power or access to food or help. Shovels and snowblowers were no match against what became a towering icy mass. The local Sheriff's Office would end up responding to at least 13 deaths.
Residents whose homes suffered damage have had little respite since, their troubles exacerbated by two atmospheric rivers over the last week that pounded the area with several inches of rain. The latest storm departed on Wednesday after leaving a slushy mess in the mountain regions and flooding various parts of California.
When last month's snowstorm began, Mr. Rice thought he could at least maintain a clear portion of the driveway that sloped down from the street and ran 50 feet to his attached garage.
"But it was snowing so hard, it just didn't do any good," he said. "It was almost like a blizzard condition; wind was blowing, and I just couldn't keep up with it."
Mr. Rice had been a paratrooper and sergeant in the Army for six years before becoming a police officer. For almost three decades he held a second job as a corporate security supervisor for UPS. He liked to take charge and lead. He did not like asking for help.
He had gotten word about his wife's condition from his daughter Shelley Renison, who lived out of the snow's reach in San Bernardino. By that time, Ms. Renison, her sister and her brother had gone to their mother's bedside.
Their mother's decline had been difficult to watch. Once able to get around with an oxygen tank, she now had a tracheal tube. About a year ago, she grew uninterested in using the valve attachment required to speak.
Mr. Rice bought her a tablet so they could communicate through a messaging app. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he sat outside her window with a dry erase board, holding up bits of conversation. She replied with notes on her own board.
But about six months ago, Ms. Rice appeared to lose awareness of her surroundings. She did not always recognize who visited. Her family lived for the rare moments when her eyes would suddenly focus and she smiled or mouthed, "I love you." This had not happened for a while. And the family had recently agreed to a do-not-resuscitate order.
And so it seemed, on the last weekend of February, that Ms. Rice would die with her three children around her but her husband far away.
"We just kind of came to accept the fact that he wasn't going to be there, and we were trying to prepare him for that," said Ms. Renison, a middle school vice principal and teacher. "He was in denial. He kept thinking he'd figure out a way to get himself down here."
On Feb. 26, Mr. Rice decided to dig a path up the driveway so that he might be able to walk to the street, which he couldn't even see. The snow loomed above his head, near the edge of his roof.
He began hacking at the icy mass with a shovel, and then used the snowblower to try to clear what fell. He repeated the routine again and again, his fingers aching in the 25-degree chill.
But after two hours, sweaty and exhausted, he gave in. He had managed to scrape out only a 10-foot line.
"I looked out there and said, 'There's no way I'm getting out."'
That evening, he received a call. Doctors had managed to find a way to help his wife dispel the carbon dioxide through her ventilator. It bought Mr. Rice some time.
Still, the days would continue with no solution to all of the clogged driveways and impassable roads. When the snow finally stopped, an eerie stillness came over the neighborhood. Social media posts revealed the hard truth. So many in the region were stuck at home.
Mr. Rice passed the hours with episodes of "M*A*S*H" and "Dragnet" that he had thought to download before his satellite dish was buried. Luckily his power went out for only a short period of time. He called the nursing facility every day to check on Ms. Rice's condition and constantly messaged his daughter for updates.
He and his wife had bought their butterscotch-colored two-story house in 1979 while it was still under construction. Ms. Rice had walked inside and declared, "This is the place."
She was the one who charmed the neighbors, offering rides to everyone's kids. Quick-witted and playful, she endeared herself to customers while running the beloved Good Witch's Bakery at Santa's Village, a nearby amusement park.
Mr. Rice was more restrained, uncomfortable with displays of emotion.
Years of active duty had hardened him, he admitted. "I learned when I was overseas you don't make really good friends because, my God, you might lose him or never see him again," he said. In many ways he was drawn to his wife because of the light she seemed to exude.
After his wife moved out five years ago, he had refused to make any changes to their home, insisting that he needed her input. A part of him believed she would get better and come back.
By March 5, Mr. Rice noticed the bay window in his living room was cracking from the weight of the snow. The only walkable area outside was the patio where Ranger had taken to relieving himself before rushing back indoors. There was still no conceivable way to get up the driveway.
A couple of friends eventually trudged over with shovels. But after a day of work, their efforts felt futile.
Then three days later, Mr. Rice received word that his wife's hemoglobin levels were dropping because of internal bleeding. She was already undergoing blood transfusions every other day. Nothing was helping.
The doctors recommended stopping intervention. Ms. Rice could have six months left, they said. A handful of weeks was more likely.
Mr. Rice tried to absorb what he heard. He opened a book to busy himself, but had an urgent and terrible feeling.
"I sat there and thought, 'Oh my God, she's going to die before I get there."'
Then the tears came.
That's when he decided to take a different approach. He went to his laptop and began to type.
"I never thought I would have to do this. Here goes," he started. "My wife Ann is in a skilled nursing facility down the hill. She does not have long to go. I can't even get down to say goodbye. Is there anyone who can help with my driveway. It's about half done, needs to be wider so I can back my small car up. I'm a Army Vietnam veteran and retired LEO. This is very embarrassing for me to even ask for help. Sorry."
He added his phone number, and then posted the plea on a local Facebook group.
"I was hoping that people wouldn't think I sound corny," he said. "There were other people who probably needed the help more than me."
It did not take long before Mr. Rice's phone began to ring. Someone wanted to drop off food. A man offered to donate money for a hotel near his wife. One woman said she could ferry him to her in a Jeep. Firefighters stopped by for a wellness check. Five neighbors showed up at his front yard with shovels. Numerous people thanked him for his service. And many told him he should not feel embarrassed.
It was his longtime neighbor who appeared that day with the answer: a tractor with a front loader bucket purchased a few years ago for the winters. He could manage the roads because an agency had recently made a pass through the area with a plow. After three hours, a path had been carved out of Mr. Rice's driveway.
On Thursday morning, March 9, Mr. Rice hopped in his Chevrolet Trax and began to back it out of the garage, but it soon scraped against the wall of snow. The path was still not wide enough. He spent another two hours broadening the opening.
Finally, he managed to get up onto the street. He eased down the mountain, flanked by giant snow berms that had created what felt like a one-way tunnel. Relief surged through his veins as he headed toward his wife.
When he arrived at her side, he reached out and clasped her hand. He smoothed her face and hair and told her how he had spent his days, how much he had missed her, loved her. How he wanted to make it to her before she slipped away.
Mr. Rice could not tell whether his wife knew he was there. But he had heard that those close to death retained their hearing long after other senses gave out. Hopefully she knew at least that she was not alone.
He would be back tomorrow.

Full text: When Alex Murdaugh was convicted of murdering his wife and son, some South Carolinians saw the verdict as a step toward dismantling a system of power "based on who you know."
Across the chasms of race and class that have long divided and defined South Carolina, Alex Murdaugh appeared in the life of Pamela Pinckney at her darkest moment, offering to help.
It was 2009. Mr. Murdaugh, a white man, was a personal injury lawyer and the scion of a storied multigenerational legal dynasty that held sway for decades over a five-county swath of the Lowcountry. Ms. Pinckney, a Black woman, was in the hospital. She and her children had been on their way to a dollar store when her SUV flipped, resulting in serious spinal injuries to her 19-year-old son, Hakeem, that rendered him quadriplegic.
Mr. Murdaugh sued the manufacturer of the tires on the SUV, eventually winning the family a substantial settlement.
Then Mr. Murdaugh quietly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars that the family was owed.
"He seemed to be a nice person," Ms. Pinckney said. "But looks are very much deceiving."
Ms. Pinckney was only one of his victims. Mr. Murdaugh's long, cruel and largely low-profile run of what prosecutors said was multi-million-dollar embezzlement and theft exploded into one of the most widely documented American crime stories of the decade as Mr. Murdaugh, 54, went on trial over the past six weeks for the murder of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul. Podcasters, reporters and TV producers rushed to South Carolina to tell a Shakespearean story of filicide, anchored by a main character whose button-down shirts seem to cover a terrifying moral void.
One reason the Murdaugh case became a national sensation -- a small-town murder trial suddenly carried live on television -- was its Lowcountry setting, with its Southern Gothic touches of Spanish moss, oyster roasts and preppies behaving badly. The trial revealed how a powerful lawyer in a hidden corner of the South had acted with impunity for years, fleecing clients and seemingly remaining above the law in a region his family had dominated for a century.
Now, that issue hangs not only over the Murdaugh home base of Hampton, where many local people wonder whether Mr. Murdaugh's murder conviction last week means the family's long reign of influence is finally over, but across the entire state, which has been asked to confront lingering questions about its own history.
Was Mr. Murdaugh an abnormal holdover from a vanishing, clannish South Carolina culture where small groups of wealthy white men held special privilege? Or was his story evidence that, even as the state has been transformed by an influx of global businesses and millions of newcomers, such traditions have not quite gone away?
"There's still some awfully strange inefficiencies, I'll just leave it at that, that still persist," Mark Sanford, who served two terms as governor, said of an enduring culture in the state that is "based on who you know."
Predictions that the old ways were waning have been around for decades. In the early 1990s, the state was rocked by political scandals that resulted in the convictions of numerous state lawmakers, both Black and white, for crimes including bribery, extortion and conspiracy, and the indictment of James Holderman, former president of the University of South Carolina, who was known to dole out scholarships and other perks to the children of some of the state's most powerful residents.
At the time, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said the prosecutions showed the state was moving away from a time when it was "dominated by rural barons who operated under their own code." He added: "We had something of an oligarchy down here for a lot of years, and now we're making a transition from it."
Mr. Murdaugh, however, seemed to relish his position as part of a micro-regional Southern oligarchy. He had blue police lights installed in his car, and he flashed a law-enforcement-style badge on his dashboard, on the grounds that he was a volunteer assistant prosecutor -- even though, during his trial, he testified that he had been involved in helping with just five criminal trials over a 23-year span.
For decades, his relatives supplied the five-county judicial district with its prosecutors. The family law firm, founded by Randolph Murdaugh Sr. in 1910, forged close connections to sheriffs, judges and potential jurors, and for years it made millions by taking advantage of a law that made it easy for people injured anywhere in the state to try their cases in tiny Hampton County.
Before a state Supreme Court decision closed that loophole, the American Tort Reform Association declared Hampton a "judicial hellhole," and noted that at one point in 2004, the Murdaugh-founded law firm, then known as Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Elzroth & Detrick, represented plaintiffs in 96 of the county's 156 pending civil jury cases.
It was clever work, and perfectly legal. Decades earlier, however, Mr. Murdaugh's grandfather, Randolph Murdaugh, Jr., had been accused by federal prosecutors of being the mastermind of a bootlegging and protection scheme in and around Colleton County, part of the five-county judicial district, the 14th, where his father had been the first local prosecutor.
Federal authorities alleged that untaxed whiskey production had been thriving in the area for years, abetted by local authorities.
Most of the players were found guilty, but not Mr. Murdaugh, whose lawyers argued that witnesses who had spoken against him were motivated by personal or political grudges.
Decades later, the Murdaugh family became tangled in another criminal case, when a fatal boat crash in 2019 led to charges against Paul Murdaugh, the younger of Alex Murdaugh's two sons. The authorities said Paul Murdaugh, who was 19 at the time, was drunk when, after a night of partying, he crashed the boat, owned by his father, into a bridge. A teenage passenger, Mallory Beach, was thrown from the boat by the impact and was killed; her body was recovered more than a week later.
Law enforcement and surveillance records have raised questions about whether the police were sloppy in their investigation of the crash, or gave Paul Murdaugh favorable treatment. One of the boat's six passengers told a Department of Natural Resources officer shortly after the crash that Paul Murdaugh had been driving the boat, but the officer wrote in a report that the passenger had said he was not sure who was driving.
A lawsuit filed on behalf of Connor Cook, one of the boat's passengers, notes that the authorities did not take a blood sample from Paul Murdaugh or conduct a field sobriety test. Blood later drawn at a hospital found his blood-alcohol level to be 0.28, more than three times the legal limit.
At Alex Murdaugh's murder trial, prosecutors produced a photo of him taken at the hospital on the night of the crash, when he showed up with his law-enforcement-style badge dangling from his pants pocket. According to the lawsuit, Mr. Murdaugh spoke with Mr. Cook at the hospital, telling him to "keep his mouth shut" and to tell law enforcement he did not know who was driving the boat. He told Mr. Cook to hire a lawyer named Cory Fleming, without revealing that Mr. Fleming was Mr. Murdaugh's close friend.
Paul Murdaugh ultimately was charged with boating under the influence causing death, and the case was still pending when he and his mother were murdered.
Alex Murdaugh admitted during testimony in his murder trial that he had stolen millions of dollars, but he maintained that he did not kill his wife and son. He said he believed that someone who was angry over the boat crash must have targeted his family. But prosecutors argued that he committed the murders of his wife and son in a bid to gain sympathy and keep his financial misdeeds concealed as expanding investigations threatened to force them into the light of day.
Among his financial victims was Arthur Badger, whose wife was killed by a UPS truck that crossed a centerline, leaving their six children without a mother. Mr. Murdaugh admitted that he stole $ 1.3 million from Mr. Badger's settlement. There was also Deon Martin, who was injured in a car crash, from whom Mr. Murdaugh admitted stealing half a million dollars. Mr. Murdaugh did not dispute that he took $ 1 million from two young girls whose mother had died in a car crash as a loan without their knowledge.
In one instance, state authorities said, Mr. Fleming took $ 8,000 from Ms. Pinckney's trust and used it to fly himself and Mr. Murdaugh to the college baseball World Series in 2012.
After Mr. Murdaugh was sentenced last week, the state's law enforcement chief, Mark Keel, hinted that more indictments were possible. "This case served notice to anyone who aided or assisted Alex Murdaugh in committing any crime, that justice will be sought," he said.
In Hampton, the tiny inland city that has long served as the Murdaughs' seat of power, the law firm of Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Elzroth & Detrick has changed its name to the Parker Law Group, moving into the background the now-infamous surname shared by the firm's founding partner.
It was not lost on South Carolinians that the mystique of that name had not proved in the end to be stronger than the justice system. In fact, with all of the recent attention on the family's wealth and power, the family name may have become a liability.
"There were a lot of people that, at the outset of the trial, thought the Murdaugh name was going to dictate the result," said Joe McCulloch, a lawyer in Columbia, S.C., who is representing Mr. Cook. "And it may have -- just not in the way that people anticipated, and not in the way that it did in 1956 with his grandfather."
Ms. Pinckney said she saw the murder conviction as a first step toward justice, and that she was still waiting for her day in court to recover the money she lost.
"The victims from what he's done in the murder, they had closure in their portion of their lives," she said. "But it's other people who are still waiting for closure in their lives."
Mr. Sanford, the former governor, said one of the strongest indications that South Carolina was changing for the better was the sentencing hearing for Mr. Murdaugh, which was presided over by Clifton Newman, a Black judge.
There was something "rich and relevant," Mr. Sanford said, "that you have this Black judge sentencing this guy -- this lily-white guy -- to life, whose family has been king for more than 100 years."
At the hearing, Judge Newman spoke slowly and carefully as he chastised Mr. Murdaugh for lying during his testimony, and reminded him that he and his family had been prosecuting people for years in the very same courtroom. "Many have received the death penalty," the judge noted, "probably for lesser conduct."

NEW YORK — An emaciated alligator found in Prospect Park on Sunday was the latest in a long line of saw-toothed reptiles found all over the city, raising several obvious questions: What? How? And why does this keep happening?
The animals appear in the city often enough to bolster a century-old rumor about alligators roaming in the sewer system, probably first inspired by the 1935 discovery of one — roughly 8 feet long — in an East Harlem storm drain. Films such as “Alligator” over the years have added even more intrigue. Sometimes, a year or two go by between urban alligator discoveries, but five were captured in Brooklyn and Staten Island in 2018 and 2019 alone.
The past three years have been a dry spell. Animal Care Centers of New York City, which is often called in when an alligator is spotted, had not received a single report about alligators since 2019, said Katy Hansen, the organization’s communications director.
But the city was once again captivated Sunday, when a female alligator, later named Godzilla, was pulled from Prospect Park Lake, in Brooklyn, by a maintenance worker with the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation.
The American alligator, who was about 5 feet long and was taken to the Bronx Zoo for treatment, had ingested a 4-inch wide bathtub stopper and was “lethargic and suffering from exposure to cold temperatures,” according to a zoo statement Wednesday. An alligator of her size should weigh 30 to 35 pounds; she weighed 15, the statement said.
She was the sixth alligator that Animal Care Centers, a group that finds homes for abandoned and homeless animals, has helped to rescue in the city since 2018, according to Hansen.
The Alligators of New York
The most recent cluster of alligator discoveries, according to Animal Care Centers, began in 2018 with Bobby, who was discovered in January on Staten Island by the Police Department’s gang unit.
Toby was found abandoned in Brooklyn that April.
Then in 2019, three alligators were recovered: Poland, a 5-year-old American alligator, was brought to Animal Care Centers in July after being found abandoned in a Staten Island park. Tick Tock was recovered in Brooklyn in September by the Police Department after it executed a search warrant. Wally was discovered by a parks department worker on Staten Island in October.
Aside from the boroughs in which the recent crop of alligators were found and the names Animal Care Centers gives them, information about them — how they got here and where they are now — is difficult to find, Hansen said.
The Police Department — which houses the Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad and the Emergency Service Unit — does not keep specific data on alligators they encounter, an official said. A parks department spokesperson said their recent records show they have recovered alligators from a Queens park in 2015 and on Staten Island in 2019.
But local newspapers have published stories about the encounters at least as far back as August 1815, when John T. Brouwere found an alligator while hunting near Newtown Creek, said Michael Miscione, a former official borough historian for Manhattan.
“He had a rifle on him and basically shoved the thing in the alligator’s mouth and pulled the trigger,” Miscione said. According to the Long-Island Star, which recorded the incident, the alligator was later displayed in a collection in Manhattan.
Over the years, alligators have also been spotted sunbathing in a park in Queens, behind an apartment building and in a backyard in Brooklyn. A 3-foot alligator even tried his luck crossing the street during evening rush hour in Manhattan in 2015.
In a famous incident two decades ago, city officials spent days tracking the movements of what was believed to be an alligator spotted in Central Park’s Harlem Meer, in the northeast corner of the park.
Nearly two dozen people reported seeing it: It was sunning itself, they said, and peering out of the water. An expert alligator wrangler was sent by a publicity firm from Florida to capture it.
When the nearly 2-foot reptile was caught days later, it was discovered to be a spectacled caiman, a species of crocodile native to Central and South America.
How Alligators Get to the City
Alligators are not native to New York. They prefer southern climates, and can usually be found as far north as North Carolina. To make it so far north, they likely either come by mail or prospective owners must travel to pick them up.
“You can’t buy them in New York City,” Hansen said. The pandemic may have led to a decrease in the animals because travel was more restricted, she added.
Miscione said there’s also a long history of advertisements in magazines for mail-ordered alligators, at least as far back as the 1930s.
“You could get a mail-order alligator for $1.50,” he said. “And these weren’t hoaxes. You wouldn’t get a rubber alligator — you’d get a live alligator.”
A UPS driver was doing his route in August 2001 when a leaky box alarmed him. The box was shipped from Atlanta and headed to a home in Brooklyn.
When workers at a UPS center in the borough opened the box, they found a 5-foot alligator thrashing around, its snout and legs tied with duct tape.
“We would have never accepted a package with a live animal in it,” Norman Black, a spokesperson for UPS, said at the time. “And certainly not an alligator.”
What Happens to Abandoned Alligators
Alligators that come in the mail may seem cute when they arrive, but they can rapidly outgrow their dwellings. And although mailing them may be legal, at least when they are babies, owning them as pets in New York City is not, according to the city.
When alligators are discovered, either abandoned or confiscated by police, they are sent to zoos or animal rescue organizations that care for reptiles, Hansen said.
But she said she did not have specific information about where the rescued creatures live out the rest of their lives. A spokesperson for the Bronx Zoo referred questions Thursday about alligator cases to police.
For those with illegal pets, New York City’s 311 page says owners can drop them off at Animal Care Centers shelters located in each of the boroughs, adding that those who do will not receive a violation. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Masters Mix-up Could Have Brought a Real Estate Agent to Augusta: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Scott Stallings of Georgia was surprised to receive a formal invitation from Augusta National Golf Club. It was meant for a pro golfer with the same name.
It is the stuff golfers' dreams are made of: a formal invitation from Augusta National Golf Club to compete in the Masters Tournament, considered the most prestigious event on the golf calendar.
When Scott Stallings, a real estate agent from Georgia, and his wife, Jenny, opened the door to their house on St. Simons Island on New Year's Eve, they found that just such an invitation had arrived via UPS.
The envelope, in a brilliant shade of green instantly recognizable to golfers as Masters Green, was emblazoned with the gold logo of the Augusta National Golf Club. And it was addressed to Mr. Stallings.
Inside was another envelope bearing his name -- Mr. Scott Stallings -- in calligraphy and an invitation from the club's board of governors, signed by Fred S. Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, cordially welcoming him to participate in the Masters Tournament in April.
"You just got invited to the Masters," Jenny Stallings told her husband as he unpacked the car. Both are "very casual golfers," they said; they enjoy a round or two but are not quite up to the level needed to compete alongside the likes of Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler.
But for a split second, Ms. Stallings said, her husband thought his moment had arrived.
"I was like 'OK, well, I have this invitation,"' Mr. Stallings, 60, said. "It had my name on it. What are the chances?"
Then he realized the invitation was supposed to have been sent to that other Scott Stallings, a professional golfer and three-time PGA Tour winner who is ranked 54th in the world.
"Right away, I know this isn't me," said Mr. Stallings, the real estate agent, who likes to watch Mr. Stallings, the golfer, compete. "How in the heck did it show up here?"
The couple placed the invitation on their dining room table and decided to contact Mr. Stallings, the golfer.
Mr. Stallings, the real estate agent, found the golfer on Instagram and sent him a direct message saying he had received his invitation to the Masters at his house in Georgia and was "sure this is NOT for me."
"I play but wow!" Mr. Stallings wrote, adding: "I think we have some confusion because of our names, our wife's names and geographical location."
Mr. Stallings, the golfer, who lives in Tennessee and whose wife is also named Jennifer, responded with a laughing-with-tears-of-joy emoji, indicating he thought it might be a prank.
So Mr. Stallings, the real estate agent, followed up with photos of the invitation. "I'm really not kidding I promise," he wrote in another direct message.
Mr. Stallings, the golfer, later shared the direct message from Mr. Stallings, the real estate agent, on Instagram.
"Literally had been checking the mailbox five times a day and then I got this random DM yesterday," the golfer wrote. "My Masters invite got sent to a different Scott Stallings."
Augusta National did not immediately respond on Tuesday to emails and calls seeking comment about how the invitation was sent to the wrong Scott Stallings. The club has asked players to R.S.V.P. to the invitations since the Masters began in 1934.
On Monday, the two Scott Stallingses and their wives spoke on the phone and made arrangements to get the invitation to the right Scott Stallings.
The golfer said in an interview on Tuesday that he had invited Mr. Stallings, the real estate agent, to dinner and a practice round at the Masters to thank him for agreeing to send the invitation.
"It was just nice to see someone doing the right thing," the golfer said, adding: "I was just relieved that it physically existed."
Ms. Stallings recorded a video of her husband, the real estate agent, parting ways with it at a UPS store.
"OK, Scott," she said. "Why are we at the UPS store?"
"Because I'm having to send my invitation to play at the Masters back to the other Scott Stallings," he said, holding the invitation and frowning.
"Oh, I'm sorry," she said.
"I tried," he said. "That's OK."
And then it was gone, on its way to that other Scott Stallings, the one who really will get to compete in the Masters.
"It was like getting Willy Wonka's golden ticket," Scott Stallings, the real estate agent, said on Tuesday. "It was a hard one to let go of because I know how prestigious it is."
