Full text: Amid a fresh backlash against D.E.I. efforts, OneTen met resistance as a program for Black workers only. It has shifted its emphasis to "equity for all" and a more hands-on approach.
Three years ago, dozens of big companies formed a coalition and declared an ambitious goal: to lift one million Black workers into good-paying jobs over the next 10 years, by hiring or promoting them.
The resulting nonprofit, OneTen, was created amid a crescendo of calls to address racial injustice after George Floyd's murder in 2020. It asked its members -- including AT&T, Bank of America, Cisco, Delta Air Lines, Dow, General Motors, Nike and Walmart -- to pledge to hire and promote Black workers based on skills instead of college degrees.
Fast-forward, and the social climate has since changed drastically. Pushing Black-only hiring programs has grown increasingly controversial, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling last year against race-based affirmative action policies at universities.
OneTen, which has fallen far behind the pace needed to reach its initial goal, is at the forefront of a movement to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion methods in business. And it has been forced to change with the times.
The organization has modified its messaging in the past year, especially since the Supreme Court decision, to emphasize that the policies it advocates will help "Black talent and others."
More concretely, the organization's leaders realized that asking companies to vow to make changes was not enough. OneTen has helped its members rewrite job descriptions for hundreds of roles to remove unnecessary degree requirements and clearly state the skills sought and needed. The organization has helped to design apprenticeship programs for enterprises like Delta and the Cleveland Clinic, tailored for different fields. And it has set up a network for human resources and hiring managers to share their challenges and suggest solutions, in virtual and in-person sessions.
OneTen also works to establish links among employers, training programs and workers.
"The beginning has been tough -- we've learned lessons," said Kenneth Frazier, a founder and chairman of OneTen and former chief executive of Merck. "But we still have aspirations to make a big difference."
Many companies are rethinking their diversity efforts after the Supreme Court's ruling, and states including Florida and Texas passed laws to curtail D.E.I. policies. Lawsuits have been filed threatening businesses like a fund in Atlanta focused on backing Black female entrepreneurs.
Recent research suggests a pullback from practices such as requiring diverse candidate pools when interviewing to fill jobs. And the resignation of Claudine Gay, a Black woman, as president of Harvard has been celebrated by opponents of D.E.I. initiatives in academia and business who claimed she was a diversity hire.
Pfizer and two law firms, Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, opened their diversity fellowships last year to students of all races, after lawsuits against them alleged racial discrimination.
"There is diversity fatigue," said Debbie Dyson, chief executive of OneTen. "What we're doing can't be 'This is a diversity thing.' Skills give you an alternative path."
OneTen, whose founders include prominent Black business leaders like Mr. Frazier and Kenneth Chenault, former chief executive of American Express, promoted skills-based hiring from the start. More than 60 percent of all American workers do not have four-year college degrees, according to the Census Bureau. But requiring degrees in job postings hits minority applicants particularly hard, eliminating 72 percent of Black adults, for example.
Adopting skills-based practices, work force experts say, can help companies tap a broader pool of high-performing, dedicated workers, while increasing career opportunities and household incomes for millions of Americans. One study estimated that up to 30 million workers without four-year college degrees have most of the skills to succeed in better jobs paying 70 percent more.
OneTen began with a "superaggressive" goal and a diversity message, said Plinio Ayala, chief executive of Per Scholas, a nonprofit job-training program. The shift toward emphasizing skills, he said, "makes a lot more sense and is gaining traction."
OneTen's collaboration with Delta is a case study in the organization's revised approach.
Following the OneTen playbook, the airline has removed the four-year-degree requirement from 94 percent of its job listings, including for pilot roles. Previously, about half the jobs at Delta required a college degree.
The company initially heard internal criticism that OneTen was only for Black workers. But like OneTen itself, Delta moved to emphasize that skills-based hiring and promotion can benefit all workers.
"What has been very helpful is equity for all, and we're really leaning into that equity-for-all message," said Joanne Smith, chief people officer at Delta.
OneTen has also helped the airline create an apprenticeship program designed to move hourly workers into salaried positions with career tracks that typically pay wages of at least $ 60,000 a year.
The one-year apprenticeships involve classroom and on-the-job training, mentoring and support services. Graduates are guaranteed jobs. The program, which began as an experiment with six workers in 2021, had grown last year to a group of 56, who were selected from 7,000 applicants.
Sanassa Diane was part of that group. She started at Delta in 2018 in a call center. "When you called the 1-800 number, I was the person on the other end of the call," she said.
Ms. Diane, 28, rose up the call center hierarchy to become a customer support representative for an invitation-only service mainly for Delta's most lucrative frequent fliers, although she was still paid hourly.
A little over a year ago, Ms. Diane entered the apprenticeship program, gaining a salaried job in the corporate sales department arranging contracts and deals for Delta's business-customer accounts. Her pay rose more than 50 percent.
At first, the transition was daunting, she recalled, and she had "impostor syndrome," the sense of not belonging in a work setting. Delta arranged for an outside workplace coaching firm to help her manage the anxiety.
"Stepping into the corporate world can be challenging or scary, if you're not used to it," she said.
Ms. Diane, who dropped out of college, is taking courses toward a bachelor's degree in technology and management, and plans to work her way up the corporate ladder at Delta.
Despite Delta's embrace of skills-based hiring, the approach has yet to take off more broadly. In a OneTen survey last year of 500 hiring managers, 56 percent said removing four-year degree requirements would improve their hiring practices, but only 31 percent are doing it.
Those numbers point to the gap between recognizing an issue and altering corporate behavior, said Ginni Rometty, chairwoman of OneTen and former chief executive of IBM. "That requires culture change," she said. "And it does take time."
Having refined its approach, OneTen is making progress, but it's still far behind the million-jobs-in-a-decade pace embedded in its name. So far, the coalition of companies has elevated 108,000 people who meet the OneTen definition -- Black workers without four-year college degrees hired or promoted into jobs that pay family-sustaining wages, as measured by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living-wage calculator.
In 30 percent of its allotted time, OneTen is about 10 percent of the way to its goal, even though its roster of member employers has nearly doubled to 65 companies.
Mr. Chenault, the former American Express chief, is now a managing director of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm. He compares OneTen to "a start-up that's in Year 3." It started with one focus, then saw a bigger opportunity and made a pivot.
"Yes, we're focused on African Americans, but there is this broader opportunity," he said. "If a company is going to skills-first practices, they are going to do it for everyone."
OneTen's expansion plans include working with community colleges as sources of talent and military bases as large civilian employers. But already, OneTen estimates that the income gains for the more than 100,000 Black workers its coalition partners have hired or promoted add up to $ 12 billion.
Demographic trends could also help persuade employers to change. America's working-age population is aging, shrinking and becoming more diverse. Millions of jobs are unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers.
"There is a fundamental business reason for companies to convert to a skills-based hiring system, beyond all the social justice themes that got us off the ground," said Mr. Frazier, the chairman of OneTen.

Though Layoffs Loom,
IBM Banks on Services
IBM forecast full-year revenue growth above market estimates on Wednesday, banking on stable demand for its IT software and consultancy services from businesses looking to adopt artificial intelligence.
Shares of the company were up more than 8 percent in extended trading.
The company will also lay off some employees in 2024 but will hire for more AI-centered roles, an IBM spokesperson said, and will likely end the year with a largely unchanged head count.
IBM may see a rebalancing charge similar to the about $ 400 million recorded in 2023, the spokesperson added.
Under the chief executive officer, Arvind Krishna, the more than 111-years-old company has repositioned itself to focus on software and consulting with a renewed focus on AI, capitalizing on a broader push for its integration across industries. REUTERS

Union Pacific Profits Up On Growth in Shipments
OMAHA, Neb. -- Union Pacific's fourth-quarter profit crept up 1 percent as the railroad delivered more fertilizer, imported goods and vehicles.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad said it earned $ 1.65 billion, or $ 2.71 per share, in the quarter. That's up slightly from $ 1.64 billion, or $ 2.67 per share, a year earlier.
The results topped the estimates of the analysts surveyed by FactSet Research that called for earnings of $ 2.60 per share as Union Pacific hauled 3 percent more shipments.
Jim Vena, the chief executive officer, said the railroad's key operating metrics improved in the fourth quarter with average freight car velocity jumping 14 percent to 217 daily miles per car, and the average maximum length of Union Pacific's trains increased 2 percent to 9,413 feet. The average speed of the railroad's trains also increased 5 percent to 24.9 mph. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Meta Plans $ 800 Million
Data Center In Indiana
JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. announced plans Thursday to build an $ 800 million data center in southern Indiana that's expected to create 100 long-term, high-paying jobs when it's operational and several hundred other jobs during construction.
Work will begin this month on the nearly 700,000-square-foot data center at the River Ridge Commerce Center in Jeffersonville, Meta said. Jeffersonville is an Ohio River city located just north of Louisville, Kentucky.
The Indiana Economic Development Corp. has committed to granting Meta a 35-year sales tax exemption for the data center, among other performance-based project incentives.
The project is expected to be operational in 2026, the company said. During peak construction, it's expected to support 1,250 construction jobs.
Gov. Eric Holcomb said it was "a great day for Indiana and for our southeast region."

Wall Street Rises After Economic Data Stomps Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Wall Street Rises After Economic Data Stomps Expectations
By The Associated Press
Most U.S. stocks rose Thursday following the latest signal the economy remains much stronger than expected.
The S&P 500 added 25.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,894.16 and set a record for a fifth straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 242.74, or 0.6 percent, to 38,049.13, and the Nasdaq composite gained 28.58, or 0.2 percent, to 15,510.50.
IBM helped lead the market with a gain of 9.5 percent after it reported a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Four out of five stocks in the S&P 500 rose alongside it, but Tesla kept the market's gains in check with its drop of 12.1 percent.
The electric-vehicle maker reported earnings and revenue that fell short of forecasts and warned of lower sales growth this year. As one of the largest stocks on Wall Street, its movements carry extra weight on indexes, and it was the heaviest weight by far on the S&P 500.
Wall Street's main focus was on a report indicating the U.S. economy continues to steam ahead, demolishing last year's forecasts for an imminent recession because of high interest rates.
The economy grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2023, according to an initial estimate by the U.S. government. That was much stronger than the 1.8 percent growth economists expected, according to FactSet. Such a resilient economy should drive profits for companies, which are one of the main inputs that set stock prices.
The report also gave encouraging corroboration that inflation continued to moderate at the end of 2023. Hopes are high that inflation has cooled enough from its peak two summers ago for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates this year. That in turn would ease the pressure on financial markets and boost investment prices.
A separate report showed that more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, but the number remains low relative to history and indicates a stillresilient job market.
Of course, critics say traders on Wall Street are still overly optimistic about how many times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024, and when it will begin. Traders are betting on a better than coin flip's chance for six cuts this year, which would be double what the Fed has indicated.
Wall Street also added to bets that the Fed would begin cutting rates as soon as March following the morning's economic report. They're now betting on a better than 50 percent probability, according to data from CME Group.
"The problem for traders is that rate cut expectations still have a ways to go to adjust to the reality that the Fed doesn't need to be in a hurry to cut," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
Treasury yields fell in the bond market on expectations for rate cuts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.12 percent from 4.16 percent before the report's release and from 4.18 percent late Wednesday. In October, it was at 5 percent and its highest level since 2007.
Elsewhere on Wall Street, earnings season continued to pick up the pace with more than two dozen companies in the S&P 500 reporting their latest results late Wednesday or early Thursday.
American Airlines rose 10.3 percent after reporting profit for the latest quarter that was much stronger than what analysts were expecting. United Rentals jumped 13 percent after the equipment rental company reported stronger profit than expected, raised its dividend and said it would buy back $ 1.5 billion of its stock this year.
On the losing end of Wall Street, Humana tumbled 11.7 percent after the insurer reported worse results for the end of 2023 than expected. It also gave a forecast for the full year of 2024 that fell well below Wall Street's estimate because of higher medical costs. Other insurers also dropped, including a 3.9 percent fall for UnitedHealth Group.

Tesla Price Cuts Take Toll On Profits From Car Sales In Fierce E.V. Competition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A tax benefit boosted quarterly earnings, but that masked a decline in earnings from carmaking caused by intensifying competition.
Tesla's profit from sales of electric cars slumped in the last three months of last year because of price cuts intended to thwart increasingly intense competition, the company said on Wednesday as it warned of a tough year ahead.
Profit in the fourth quarter nearly doubled to $ 7.9 billion, up from $ 3.7 billion a year earlier. But $ 5.9 billion of that profit came from a tax benefit. Without that one-time accounting effect, profit would have fallen.
Tesla has slashed prices for the two cars that make up the bulk of its sales -- the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle -- as automakers like BYD, in China, and General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen, in the United States and Europe, have begun selling more electric vehicles.
The price cuts have helped Tesla sell more cars and forced other carmakers to respond, helping to make electric vehicles more affordable. But the cuts have weighed on Tesla's profit. In 2022, Tesla was one of the most profitable carmakers in the world, but its margins from vehicle sales have fallen by almost one-third in the last year and are now comparable to those of other large rivals.
Because of the price cuts, sales revenue from cars last quarter rose just 1 percent from a year earlier, to $ 21.6 billion -- even though Tesla sold 1.8 million cars in 2023, a 35 percent increase from 2022. Tesla made up some of the difference by reducing manufacturing costs.
Tesla shares slumped about 6 percent in after-hours trading after the company said it expected sales growth to be "notably slower" in 2024 as it developed a budget-priced vehicle. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said during a conference call Wednesday that the vehicle, whose design is still a secret, might be available by late 2025.
"That will be a challenge," he cautioned, because of new technology being developed to manufacture the car at a lower cost.
At Wednesday's close, Tesla stock was 17 percent below where it started the year and down more than 25 percent from its 12-month high in July.
The carmaker faces an array of challenges this year, including economic uncertainty in all of its major markets and questions about the future role of Mr. Musk. He surprised investors this month when he said on X, the social media site he owns, that he wanted the Tesla board to raise his stake in the company to 25 percent, from 13 percent, effectively giving him shares worth more than $ 80 billion.
If he doesn't get his wish, Mr. Musk said, he will develop new artificial intelligence products "outside of Tesla." Tesla's board has not responded publicly.
Mr. Musk said Wednesday that he needed 25 percent to protect him from being ousted "by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm." He added, "There's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have, you know, strange ideas about what should be done."
Mr. Musk did not clarify how Tesla's board could grant him a stake worth $ 80 billion without diluting the value of Tesla shares.
The automaker commands more than half the electric vehicle market in the United States, and it has more models than any other manufacturer that qualify for $ 7,500 tax credits under rules that took effect Jan. 1. Plummeting prices for lithium, cobalt and other materials essential to battery production should help lower manufacturing costs.
Tesla has begun selling the Cybertruck, a pickup that is the company's first new model since the Model Y in 2020. But Tesla remains dependent on the Model 3 and Model Y for sales. BYD and Volkswagen, along with its Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, offer larger selections of vehicles.
Tesla said Wednesday that the cost of ramping up production of the Cybertruck had weighed on profit, and that it would take longer than usual to produce the vehicle in large volumes because of a complex manufacturing process. The truck's body is made of stainless steel, which resists rust and is more durable than the steel used in most cars, but is also harder to shape and weld.
Slowing sales growth for electric vehicles is another challenge. Surveys show that many people are interested in electric vehicles but hesitant to buy because of high prices and concern about finding enough places to charge the cars.
In a setback, Hertz said this month that it would sell some of its fleet of Teslas because they were less profitable than expected, and because some customers struggled with the unfamiliar technology.
Election-year politics add another element of uncertainty for all electric vehicle makers. Former President Donald J. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has called electric vehicles a hoax, and his supporters have vowed to roll back Biden administration policies intended to promote the cars and encourage domestic manufacturing.
Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who has endorsed Mr. Trump, recently portrayed electric vehicles as a subsidy for rich liberals at the expense of "hardworking families in my home state."

U.S. Turns to Ancient Seeds to Feed World in 'Revolutionary' Ways: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The U.S. global food security envoy is pushing to bring back traditional African crops that American policies helped to sideline.
Cary Fowler once helped build an Arctic vault to save the world's great variety of crop seeds from extinction. Now, as the State Department's global envoy for food security, he is trying to plant a new seed in U.S. foreign policy.
Instead of urging developing countries to grow only huge amounts of staple grains, like maize, as American policy has done for decades in Africa, Mr. Fowler is promoting a return to the great variety of traditional crops that people used to grow more of, like cowpeas, cassava and a range of millets.
He calls them "opportunity crops" because they're sturdy and full of nutrients.
The effort is still in its infancy, with a relatively tiny budget of $ 100 million. But at a time when climate shocks and rising costs are aggravating food insecurity and raising the risks of political instability, the stakes are high.
Mr. Fowler's boss, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the idea could be "genuinely revolutionary."
Traditional crops are more nourishing for people who eat them and for the soils in which they are grown, according to Mr. Fowler, and they are better at withstanding the wild weather delivered by climate change. The problem, he says, is that they've been ignored by plant breeders. His goal, through the new State Department initiative, is to increase the agricultural productivity of the most nutritious and climate-hardy among them.
The initial focus is on a half dozen crops in a half dozen countries in Africa.
"These crops have been grown for thousands of years in Africa, Mr. Fowler, 74, said in a recent interview. "They're doing something right. They're embedded in the culture. They really supply nutrition. If they have yield problems or other barriers to commercialization, frankly, by and large, it's because we haven't invested in them."
Critics say that while a focus on crop diversity and soil health is welcome, breeding crops for the commercial market may do little to improve the health and well-being of small farmers in low-income countries. It's still unclear who would produce the seeds, whether farmers would have to buy them, to what extent the new seeds need chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and whether genetically modified seeds would be included.
Mr. Fowler's office said individual countries would set their own guidelines on what kinds of seeds would be permitted in their territories and how they would be procured.
"There are some interesting hints or nods in the right direction: the focus on crop diversity and nutrition, Indigenous knowledge, a focus on neglected crops," said Bill Moseley, a professor at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., who has worked on agriculture programs with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. "What's really important is that you think about a poor farmer and what are their constraints and how do you develop something that's really useful for them."
Food has long been part of the U.S. foreign policy arsenal.
In the 1960s and '70s, the U.S.-led green revolution focused on producing more food -- specifically more maize, wheat, and rice -- using fertilizers, pesticides and hybrid seeds. Maize yields, for instance, soared, thanks to investments in plant breeding. In much of southern and eastern Africa, maize became the major food grain, while, in some places, cash crops for export, like cotton and tobacco, were prevalent.
A handful of countries came to dominate the production of cereals, while a handful of cereals -- wheat, rice and maize -- came to dominate the world's diet. While the green revolution is credited with offering up more calories, it did little to ensure a varied, nutritious diet.
"Many countries, including many in sub-Saharan Africa, have come to rely on imports of these staple foods over the past 50 years, which has shifted people's diets and led to less attention to traditional crops which are often more suited to local ecologies," said Jennifer Clapp, a professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and a member of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, a nonprofit group.
Mr. Fowler was critical of the expansion of hybrid seeds and the industrial agricultural system that came with it. Commercial hybrid seeds, he wrote in a book with the Canadian environmentalist Pat Mooney, had changed traditional farming systems, and not for the better. At global negotiations, he pushed against the U.S.-led move to patent seeds. (A company that holds a patent for a particular seed makes money by selling those seeds year after year, upending the traditional system of farmers saving seeds from each year's harvest to sow the following year.)
Seed diversity has long been Mr. Fowler's rallying cry.
He was an early proponent of an international seed bank, where the world's plant genetic resources could be conserved forever. It took 20 years to come into being, and it is now housed in an underground bunker in the Arctic Ocean archipelago of Svalbard, Norway, where it is so cold that seeds will remain frozen even if the power goes out. More than 1.2 million seed samples have been brought to the vault from a variety of national and local seed banks around the world. The Crop Trust, which helps run the Seed Vault, and which Mr. Fowler once headed, describes itself as the "ultimate insurance policy for the world's food supply."
"We are losing biodiversity every day," Mr. Fowler told The Times in an interview in 2008. "It's a kind of drip, drip, drip. We need to do something about it."
But it's one thing to lock up seeds inside an Arctic mountain, and quite another to steer agricultural policy.
Mr. Fowler began by compiling a list of traditional crops that pack the most nutrition and then asked researchers to map which crops would grow well in the climates of the future. He roped in the African Union and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. A list of 60-odd crops emerged. For those, Mr. Fowler's program intends to support plant breeding efforts. A handful of private companies have been recruited, including IBM to help map soils and Bayer to produce some of the seeds.
Mr. Fowler said that he was not trying to stop the promotion of staple grains but wanted to expand the range of crops that get attention and investment.
"We focused on traditional and Indigenous crops, because they haven't gotten the focus ever before," Mr. Fowler said. "This program is not about telling farmers when to grow or telling people what to eat. It's about presenting options."
His favorite of these opportunity crops are grass peas. He first saw them on a visit to Ethiopia during a bad drought. The soil was dry and caked. There were deep fissures in the earth. "And here was this beautiful little plant, flowering," he said. "I thought, 'What a generous little plant this is."'
The grass pea is among the most drought and flood-tolerant legumes in the world. It can be a lifesaver when nothing else grows, according to the Crop Trust. But eat too much of certain varieties of grass pea, and they can cause neurological damage. Plant breeders are trying to develop hardy but nontoxic varieties.
Mr. Fowler is growing 48 breeding lines of it on his farm in Dutchess County, north of New York City.

Tracing the Outsize Impact Of the 'Magnificent Seven': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The S&P 500 is at a new high, and investors have just a handful of stocks to thank for it.
Since the index hit its latest low in October 2022, seven stocks -- Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla -- have collectively risen over 110 percent, far outpacing the performance of the other 493 companies in the S&P 500. Together, these stocks have become known as the "Magnificent Seven."
But it's not just the stellar price performance of these stocks that helped lift the S&P 500 to a closing record on Friday. The stock index is weighted by market capitalization, meaning the moves of the largest companies contribute more to the performance of the index. In other words, the influence of these seven stocks comes down to their size. Their market value has risen more than 60 percent since October 2022.
The outsize impact of the Magnificent Seven can work both ways. During the later months of 2022, their relatively weak showing dragged the S&P 500 down. Over the last twelve months, their gains have accounted for more than 60 percent of the return in the S&P 500.
Indeed, based on price alone, the seven big tech stocks were not the best performing in the S&P 500. Royal Caribbean, the cruise line, rose 212 percent, between October 2022 and Friday, and General Electric has risen over 160 percent. However, these companies hold less weight in the index because they are much smaller, and each is responsible for less than 1 percent of the index's move since October 2022.
And some of the Magnificent Seven have done better than others. Nvidia, the chipmaker, rose a startling 417 percent between October 2022 and Friday, while Amazon gained just 38 percent. Microsoft has risen about 79 percent, but because it's the largest stock in the index, its move still outweighed Meta's 198 percent gain over the same period.
Understanding the dominance of Big Tech on the S&P 500 is important for understanding the signal the index is sending about the market, companies and the economy. A rising S&P 500 is usually seen as a good thing, but when an index is led higher by just a small number of companies, it can mask turbulence beneath the surface. In other words, the index can rise even when a majority of companies fall.
This has always been the case. In the 1980s, companies like IBM, Exxon and General Electric dominated, but never quite to the degree that the new breed of tech behemoths has in recent years.
Last March, a crisis among the nation's banks sent many individual stock prices tumbling. But the S&P 500 finished the month 3 percent higher, largely because of the furor surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence and what they could mean for the tech giants' profitability.
This dynamic has begun to subside in recent months, as more companies have joined the rally. More than half the companies in the index are higher than they were when the S&P reached its previous peak in January 2022.
Some analysts say this is a sign that the rally has more room to run as those stocks that have lagged behind begin to catch up, bolstered by greater optimism over the outlook for the economy.
Others warn that it may simply be the rise before a fall, especially as the economy continues to slow, weighing on those same companies.

A ‘Revolutionary’ Way to Feed the World That’s Very Old

Cary Fowler once helped build an Arctic vault to save the world’s great variety of crop seeds from extinction. Now, as the State Department’s global envoy for food security, he is trying to plant a new seed in U.S. foreign policy.
Instead of urging developing countries to grow only huge amounts of staple grains, like maize, as American policy has done for decades in Africa, Fowler is promoting a return to the great variety of traditional crops that people used to grow more of, like cowpeas, cassava and a range of millets.
He calls them “opportunity crops” because they’re sturdy and full of nutrients.
The effort is still in its infancy, with a relatively tiny budget of $100 million. But at a time when climate shocks and rising costs are aggravating food insecurity and raising the risks of political instability, the stakes are high.
Fowler’s boss, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the idea could be “genuinely revolutionary.”
Traditional crops are more nourishing for people who eat them and for the soils in which they are grown, according to Fowler, and they are better at withstanding the wild weather delivered by climate change. The problem, he says, is that they’ve been ignored by plant breeders. His goal, through the new State Department initiative, is to increase the agricultural productivity of the most nutritious and climate-hardy among them.
The initial focus is on a half dozen crops in a half dozen countries in Africa.
“These crops have been grown for thousands of years in Africa, Fowler, 74, said in a recent interview. “They’re doing something right. They’re embedded in the culture. They really supply nutrition. If they have yield problems or other barriers to commercialization, frankly, by and large, it’s because we haven’t invested in them.”
Critics say that while a focus on crop diversity and soil health is welcome, breeding crops for the commercial market may do little to improve the health and well-being of small farmers in low-income countries. It’s still unclear who would produce the seeds, whether farmers would have to buy them, to what extent the new seeds need chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and whether genetically modified seeds would be included.
Fowler’s office said individual countries would set their own guidelines on what kinds of seeds would be permitted in their territories and how they would be procured.
“There are some interesting hints or nods in the right direction: the focus on crop diversity and nutrition, Indigenous knowledge, a focus on neglected crops,” said Bill Moseley, a professor at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, who has worked on agriculture programs with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. “What’s really important is that you think about a poor farmer and what are their constraints and how do you develop something that’s really useful for them.”
Food has long been part of the U.S. foreign policy arsenal.
In the 1960s and ’70s, the U.S.-led Green Revolution focused on producing more food — specifically more maize, wheat, and rice — using fertilizers, pesticides and hybrid seeds. Maize yields, for instance, soared, thanks to investments in plant breeding. In much of southern and eastern Africa, maize became the major food grain, while, in some places, cash crops for export, like cotton and tobacco, were prevalent.
A handful of countries came to dominate the production of cereals, while a handful of cereals — wheat, rice and maize — came to dominate the world’s diet. While the green revolution is credited with offering up more calories, it did little to ensure a varied, nutritious diet.
“Many countries, including many in sub-Saharan Africa, have come to rely on imports of these staple foods over the past 50 years, which has shifted people’s diets and led to less attention to traditional crops, which are often more suited to local ecologies,” said Jennifer Clapp, a professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and a member of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, a nonprofit group.
Fowler was critical of the expansion of hybrid seeds and the industrial agricultural system that came with it. Commercial hybrid seeds, he wrote in a book with Canadian environmentalist Pat Mooney, had changed traditional farming systems, and not for the better. At global negotiations, he pushed against the U.S.-led move to patent seeds. (A company that holds a patent for a particular seed makes money by selling those seeds year after year, upending the traditional system of farmers saving seeds from each year’s harvest to sow the following year.)
Seed diversity has long been Fowler’s rallying cry.
He was an early proponent of an international seed bank, where the world’s plant genetic resources could be conserved forever. It took 20 years to come into being, and it is now housed in an underground bunker in the Arctic Ocean archipelago of Svalbard, Norway, where it is so cold that seeds will remain frozen even if the power goes out. More than 1.2 million seed samples have been brought to the vault from a variety of national and local seed banks around the world.

Full text: Automakers like Ford, Kia and Toyota are offering more hybrid options to appeal to buyers who aren't ready for fully electric vehicles.
As Teslas and other electric vehicles dazzled car buyers with futuristic technology and dreams of a gasoline-free future, hybrid cars began to seem like yesterday's news. Sales of the Toyota Prius, the standard-bearer for hybrids, fell 85 percent over a decade.
Now, a slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has led General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen to walk back ambitious targets for those vehicles. And sales of hybrids are robust, underscoring what may be the enduring reality check of 2023: Many Americans are hugely receptive to electrification, but they're not ready for a fully electric car.
"Consumers want the same experience they've had" with a combustion engine car, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. "And we are not there yet. Price is still the top barrier for most consumers."
Americans bought a record 1.2 million electric vehicles last year, a gain of about 46 percent and a 7.6 percent share of all new car sales, according to Cox. But hybrid sales rose even faster, up 65 percent to more than 1.2 million, lifting their market share to 8 percent from 5.5 percent, according to Edmunds. Throw in plug-in hybrids, and nearly one in 10 new cars pairs a gasoline engine with electric motors to save fuel and boost performance.
Analysts say stubbornly high electric car prices and worries about public charging are pushing some car shoppers to hybrids, including renters or urbanites who can't charge a battery-powered car at home. Hybrids deliver savings at the pump with no need to plug in for hours or plan trips around charging stops. Their batteries are much smaller and cost a lot less than the batteries in fully electric vehicles.
Buyers paid about $ 42,500 on average for hybrids in November, according to Edmunds, compared with $ 60,500 for electric vehicles and $ 47,500 for a conventional models. There is a smorgasbord of affordable hybrid models, many starting around $ 30,000 -- including a stylishly redesigned Prius that returns a model-record 57 miles per gallon. The electric vehicle market, by contrast, remains top-heavy with luxury offerings.
Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, said mainstream consumers were fundamentally different from early adopters who flocked to electric vehicles with little encouragement or education from automakers.
"E.V.s continue to grow with spectacular numbers, but what's changing is that people buying them are not willing to pay a premium," Mr. Farley said in an interview. "Now we have to get costs under control and even -- surprise, surprise -- advertise."
Ford is trimming its planned production of the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and increasing output of the more-affordable F-150 Hybrid by 20 percent. The automaker plans to quadruple overall hybrid production in hopes of selling 100,000 this year. They include the red-hot Maverick compact pickup, whose 37-m.p.g. hybrid version has exceeded Ford's most optimistic sales forecasts.
So why doesn't Ford make all Mavericks hybrids? Mr. Farley said the company remained committed to offering a full range of powertrains, including electrified trucks that can double as mobile generators to power equipment, homes or even the electrical grid. Securing battery supplies also takes a long time, Mr. Farley said, sometimes longer than building a new assembly line.
"We didn't know a $ 30,000 truck would be this popular," he said of the Maverick. "Ford has struggled to make money on small cars since the beginning of time."
The hybrid resurgence is mainly benefiting Toyota, Honda and Hyundai Motor, including its Kia sister brand.
Those automakers account for roughly 90 percent of U.S. hybrid sales, followed by Ford. All continue to invest in the technology even as G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers vow to pivot entirely to electric vehicles.
Honda outdid itself in 2023, nearly tripling hybrid sales to 294,000 units. Hybrid versions of the Honda Accord sedan and the CR-V sport utility vehicle now account for more than half those models' sales. That Accord combines luxury-level comfort, quality and amenities with up to 44 m.p.g. in overall driving, for $ 33,290 to start.
En route to record U.S. sales in 2023, Hyundai, Kia and their Genesis luxury brand together sold more electric vehicles in the United States than any automaker save Tesla. Yet Hyundai Motor remains bullish on hybrids, even after the Biden administration proposed regulations that would require two-thirds of new cars to be fully electric by 2032.
"Anyone who wants to survive in this business is making these electric investments," said Steve Center, chief operating officer at Kia America. That includes Hyundai, which has committed to investing $ 12 billion in factories in Alabama and Georgia.
But Mr. Center added that an electric vehicle might not serve the needs of a "cowboy in Montana with a pickup truck." Hybrids can help reduce emissions from those kinds of vehicles faster, he said.
Mr. Center offered a bold prediction: As combustion engine cars fade into obsolescence, all remaining gasoline models will adopt electrification in hybrid form. Gasoline cars won't be able to compete without it, as consumers and regulators alike demand better fuel economy and reduced emissions.
"Everything should be hybrid to start with, because everyone can drive a hybrid, everywhere," he said.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, seems to be treading that path. Within a few months, Toyota will offer nine hybrid-only models, including one from its Lexus luxury brand. The company sold more than 640,000 hybrids in America last year, 29 percent of its total U.S. sales; it sold about 15,000 fully electric vehicles.
David Christ, general manager of Toyota's North American division, said the automaker expects to crack 40 percent electrified sales in 2024. He echoed Mr. Center's view on the prospects for combustion engine cars.
"Over time, we're not opposed to going all-hybrid to make a faster step to a greener future," Mr. Christ said.
Toyota's faith in democratizing hybrid technology turned the company, once an environmental darling, into a whipping boy as it was widely accused of foot-dragging over electric vehicles. If Toyota is feeling vindicated, Mr. Christ won't admit it.
"A year ago, we were getting roasted in the media for not being an E.V. believer," he said. "We thought that was unfair, that we weren't in on electrification. We started it. We have eight million hybrids on the road today, and every one reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
But Mr. Christ added that the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles was not yet ready for many millions of battery-powered cars, which is why sales of such vehicles have slowed.
"At the end of the day, the consumer drives this industry, not the manufacturer," he said.
Toyota will plant its biggest flag yet in June. The redesigned 2025 Camry will be offered only as a hybrid. That may seem to be a major gamble for the nation's perennially best-selling sedan. Toyota sold about 290,000 Camrys last year, and just 35,000 were hybrids. If the new Camry can maintain its sales, Toyota will convert a few hundred thousand buyers to a roughly 50-m.p.g. hybrid in one swoop. If not, the Camry franchise will take a huge hit.
Yet Toyota isn't taking a shot in the dark. When Toyota switched the Sienna to an all-hybrid lineup for the 2021 model year, it immediately became America's best-selling minivan, up from fourth place.
But some auto experts said hybrids could do only so much.
Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said hybrids were a critical, affordable tool that allowed millions of drivers to use less gasoline but remained a transition technology. Long-term climate change goals still demand a shift to electric vehicles powered by a renewable energy grid, he said.
"In our comments to the E.P.A. and industry, it's 'Hey, put a hybrid on everything,"' Mr. Cooke said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. "But we still need stricter standards to ensure automakers face rules on what's technologically achievable."
Mr. Cooke noted that the fuel economy of the nation's fleet had held flat for years, in part because of the shift to pickups and S.U.V.s. Recent gains are entirely attributable to the rise of electric vehicles, with hybrids playing a negligible role.
Chris Harto, transportation and energy policy analyst for Consumer Reports, agreed with that assessment. "Hybrids buy some time, but E.V.s are where we need to go" to achieve climate goals, he said.
Yet Mr. Harto bemoans the popular narrative that pits hybrids and electric vehicles against each other.
"They're both taking market share from less efficient I.C.E. vehicles," Mr. Harto said, referring to internal combustion engines. "And there's a lot of market share to take."

Full text: Donald Erwin, a 59-year-old disabled veteran, disappeared in 2013 after leaving his home in the Ozarks. Last month, a YouTube diver found his car submerged at a nearby property.
One morning in late December 2013, Donald L. Erwin, a 59-year-old disabled veteran, told his wife he was going to buy cigarettes.
He often woke before dawn and was a heavy smoker. She went back to sleep. Sometime after 6 a.m., Mr. Erwin got into his silver Hyundai and left his mobile home in the central Ozarks.
He never returned.
For nearly a decade, Mr. Erwin's family, together with some friends and locals, have scoured the hilly region near his home in Camdenton, Mo., for clues. "I did not stop for nine years," Mr. Erwin's sister, Yvonne Erwin-Bowen, said in an interview, noting that she would travel from her home in Kansas City at least twice a year to search. Mr. Erwin's wife has since died.
By last year, Ms. Erwin-Bowen, 62, had begun to lose steam. "I didn't go look for my brother one time," she said. "I literally put it in God's hands."
Then, last month, Ms. Erwin-Bowen received a call from a friend: A scuba diver had found her brother's car about five miles from his home, submerged in a pond. The car, a 2002 Elantra, was retrieved on Dec. 16 from a private property in southern Camden County, according to a news release from the local authorities. Several days later, detectives and cadaver dogs recovered human remains and an artificial hip that matched Mr. Erwin's, the authorities said.
The diver, James Hinkle, said in an interview that he became aware of the case about two years ago and began methodically searching bodies of water near Mr. Erwin's home in a kayak mounted with sonar equipment, as well as with a drone.
On the afternoon of Dec. 14, Mr. Hinkle, whose volunteer scuba search-and-recovery team runs a YouTube channel, decided to search a pond on a private property, when he noticed a tire floating in the water. "That kind of got my nerves a' jumping," he said. Using a drone, Mr. Hinkle then observed a light, square-shaped object in the water. As he began to move the drone closer, he added, "it looked more and more like a car."
Two days later, Mr. Hinkle returned to the property with his kayak, a submergible camera and a magnet tied to a rope, which he dropped onto the car as a guide. Sheriff's deputies and detectives, together with divers from the local fire department, were able to reach the car and match its license plate to Mr. Erwin's. A local towing company then helped haul the vehicle from the pond.
The grim discovery has brought a confusing mix of closure, elation and renewed agony to the people who spent years searching for Mr. Erwin. "It is a new heartbreak," Ms. Erwin-Bowen, his sister, said. "Even though I knew in my heart he was gone -- accepting the reality is a whole different thing."
Mr. Erwin, who was also known as "Donnie," served in the Navy during the Vietnam War and later moved to Georgia, she said. But a rare condition led to his losing a leg. Ultimately, Mr. Erwin lost his job as a programmer at Mitsubishi, she said.
Eventually, Mr. Erwin and his wife moved to a mobile home in the Ozarks. Shortly before Mr. Erwin's death, he learned he would likely need to have his second leg amputated, Ms. Erwin-Bowen said. "My brother did what he did because he didn't want to be a burden on anybody," she added, noting that she believed he had taken his own life.
"People always say when you find that loved one, you get the closure," she added. "No you don't, because you'll never understand."
More than 24,000 people remain missing across the United States, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. Other cold cases have been solved by amateurs before the authorities. In 2021, a YouTuber found a car belonging to two Tennessee teenagers who had been missing for 21 years; another search-and-recovery dive group claims it has helped solve 29 such cases.
Ms. Erwin-Bowen said that she hoped that her family's story would encourage others in similar situations not to lose hope. "Never stop looking, the answer is out there," she said. "Never give up."

U.S. Auto Sales Expected To Slow After Strong 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers sold more cars in 2023 than a year ago as supply chain chaos ended, but sales are now under pressure from higher interest rates.
After enjoying a strong rebound in sales in 2023, the auto industry appears headed for slower growth this year as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices for new cars and light trucks.
Edmunds, a market researcher, expects the industry to sell 15.7 million vehicles this year. That would amount to a modest increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, when sales jumped 12 percent.
"There's definitely pent-up demand out there, because people have been holding off purchases for a while," said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. "But given the credit situation, we don't think the industry will see a ton of growth this year."
Since the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have struggled with shortages of critical parts that have prevented them from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In 2023, the shortages, especially for computer chips, finally eased, allowing production to return to more normal levels.
But over the past year, the Federal Reserve has significantly raised interest rates, which has pushed up costs considerably for car buyers.
For years, many people took advantage of zero-percent loans to buy vehicles, even as prices climbed. But such deals, offered by automakers to move inventory, have nearly disappeared in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, new-vehicle sales with zero-percent financing accounted for just 2.3 percent of all sales, according to Edmunds.
Monthly payments are at near-record highs. In the fourth quarter, the average monthly payment on new cars was $ 739, up from $ 717 in the same period a year ago.
Several automakers were hoping that a rapid rise in sales of new electric vehicles would drive the industry to gains into 2024 and 2025, but those cars and trucks haven't taken off quite as quickly as many analysts and executives had hoped.
In 2023, sales of battery-powered models in the United States topped one million vehicles for the first time, and Cox Automotive, another research firm, expects sales to reach 1.5 million this year. But General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other manufacturers had been expecting an even faster ramp-up.
But consumers have balked at the high prices of many of the newest electric models. Many drivers are also reluctant to make the switch to battery power, because they are not sure they will be able to find enough places to quickly refuel. That has forced automakers to reset their plans.
G.M. had once forecast it would produce 400,000 electric vehicles by the middle of 2024 but now has given up that target, and it has delayed the production of some electric models.
Ford had been aiming to have enough factory capacity by the end of 2024 to make 600,000 battery-powered vehicles a year, but it recently lowered production plans for its electric F-150 Lightning and its electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E.
On Wednesday, G.M. said that its sales of new vehicles in the United States jumped 14 percent last year. The company sold 2.6 million cars and light trucks in 2023, up from 2.3 million in 2022, when the chip shortage limited production.
G.M. sold about 76,000 electric vehicles, up from 39,000 in 2022. But most were Chevrolet Bolts, a model that the company recently stopped making. Only about 13,000 were vehicle based on newer battery technology that G.M. had been hoping would make its electric vehicles affordable to many more car buyers.
Sales for G.M. in the fourth quarter were relatively weak. They climbed just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier and were down 7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023. The company said the sales of several important models were limited by a strike at some of its plants by the United Automobile Workers union.
Separately, Toyota Motor, the second largest seller of cars in the United States after G.M., said its 2023 sales rose 7 percent, to 2.2 million vehicles. The company's sales in the fourth quarter were 15.4 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago and about 5 percent higher than in the third quarter.
Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Ram and Jeep vehicles, said that it sold 1.5 million cars and trucks in 2023, about 1 percent less than the year before. The company plans to introduce eight new electric vehicles this year, and it aims to have battery-powered models account for half of its North American sales by the end of the decade.
Honda, Hyundai and Kia also on Wednesday reported strong U.S. sales for 2023 And on Tuesday, Tesla, which dominates the electric car business in the United States, said it sold 1.8 million cars worldwide last year, up 38 percent from 2022.
Ford is expected to report its sales total on Thursday.

Tesla Sales Swing Back After Prices Are Slashed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024.
Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles -- provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024.
The company said on Tuesday that it sold 484,500 cars in the fourth quarter, up from 435,000 in the third quarter and 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles. The gains put Tesla on track to sell more than two million cars in 2024, potentially overtaking established carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and Renault.
The rebound in sales during the fourth quarter should help calm investor concerns about whether Tesla can defend its dominance of the market for electric vehicles as it faces increased competition from traditional carmakers.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles. Tesla accounts for half the electric cars sold in the United States. In 2022, Tesla accounted for two-thirds of the market.
Another electric vehicle maker, Rivian, said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 14,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. That number was up substantially from a year earlier but down about 10 percent from the third quarter.
In China, the largest market for electric cars, Tesla faces intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers. BYD sold 526,000 fully electric cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, exceeding Tesla, a milestone that many auto analysts had been expecting given the Chinese company's rapid growth.
Chinese automakers have moved faster in offering a wide range of affordable electric models as the market has expanded beyond the affluent early adopters of technology. They are the core customers who have bought Teslas for as long as the company has been around.
"The customers who are buying E.V.s now are second adopters, who have fundamentally different needs," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. "They care about tangible and immediately realizable decreases in total cost of ownership, and they care about convenience."
In Europe, Volkswagen and its Audi and Skoda divisions sell more electric vehicles than Tesla, although the Tesla Model Y is by far the best-selling model on the continent, according to data compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research.
In the United States, people interested in buying an electric car had a strong incentive to take delivery before the end of the year because of new rules intended to cut China out of the supply chain.
Tesla had warned on its website that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would no longer qualify for $ 7,500 federal tax credits after Dec. 31. The cars have batteries made in China. Germany and some other European countries have also rolled back subsidies for electric vehicle buyers.
To maintain sales, Tesla cut prices, offering Model 3s on its website for well under $ 30,000 after factoring in the tax credits. By late December, the number of lower-priced cars listed on the website appeared to have dwindled, suggesting that the strategy had succeeded. But the price reductions cut into Tesla profits, which fell 44 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Tesla said it would announce earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Jan. 24.
While fewer Teslas will qualify for federal tax credits in 2024, the company is in a better position than most of its competitors. The Performance version of the Model 3, which includes upgraded wheels and brakes, will remain eligible for the subsidy, as will all versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle, according to a federal government website. Tesla makes batteries for those cars at a Nevada plant operated with Panasonic, allowing it to meet domestic manufacturing requirements.
That gives Tesla a significant advantage over competitors like Ford, which has said that its Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicle will not qualify for the credit in the new year.
Ford and others rely on manufacturers in China for crucial components. Ford is building battery factories in the United States, but they will not begin producing until 2025.
General Motors has been building batteries at a new factory in Ohio, but has struggled to get the plant operating at full capacity. Initially only the Chevrolet Bolt will qualify for tax credits, G.M. said in December. The Cadillac Lyriq and electric Chevrolet Blazer will no longer be eligible.
G.M. has said it is adjusting its supply chain so that those and other vehicles, including electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Equinox sport utility vehicle, will become eligible early in the year.
Tesla and other carmakers may also benefit from lower interest rates in the new year. Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will start to ratchet down rates as inflation cools.

China's Auto Giant BYD Sells More Electric Cars And Hybrids Than Ever: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales by BYD, the country's dominant automaker, topped 3 million last year, including 1.6 million fully battery-powered cars. It's a sign of China's rapid growth in EVs.
The Chinese corporate giant BYD said Monday that it sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, its most ever, capping a turbulent year for China's electric vehicle industry.
Even as sales surged, heavy competition and a sustained price war took a financial toll on many automakers.
But BYD last year sold 1.6 million fully electric vehicles and another 1.4 million hybrids, which are powered by both batteries and gasoline. Together that is a 62 percent increase over 2022. BYD is also making money, tripling its profit to $ 1.5 billion in the first half of last year.
All told, Chinese automakers are expected to have sold about 9.4 million electric vehicles and hybrids last year, an increase from 6.9 million in 2022, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The group said it expected sales in 2024 to rise again, to 11.5 million.
Already the world's largest automobile market, China is now also its fastest growing, racing ahead in the electric vehicle transition that is upending the global industry. China rules the supply chain for battery-powered cars -- from the mining and processing of cobalt and other minerals used in batteries, to the deployment of robots in factories that make cars and trucks. China's electric vehicle companies and their suppliers employ some 1.5 million people.
A big reason for China's early lead in electric vehicles was the government's heavy financial support for the industry's development. After financial incentives for consumers expired at the end of 2022, automakers slashed car prices to lure buyers. Many companies, including BYD, introduced another round of cuts this fall, intensifying the price war.
In November, BYD advertised discounts on five models of up to 18,000 renminbi ( $ 2,550). Another Chinese electric vehicle company, Ji Yue, a partnership of Geely and Baidu, slashed the price of all versions of its first model by RMB 30,000 ( $ 4,200) in November.
Last year's price cutting was started by Tesla, the American automaker that has a factory in Shanghai. In January 2023 it lowered prices in China for the second time in three months, and others followed.
Tesla is expected this week to report a big jump in its worldwide sales after slashing prices at the end of last year, and as customers took advantage of U.S. tax breaks. Founded in 2003, Tesla is on a path to sell about 1.8 million battery powered vehicles for the year, up from 1.3 million in 2022. It makes about half of all electric vehicles sold in the United States.
As Tesla and BYD rival for the spot as the world's most prolific maker of fully electric vehicles, both companies face increasing competition from legacy automakers that are spending billions of dollars to catch up.
"I think an industry shakeout is an inevitable trend," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents the country's domestic industry. "But it's still uncertain who will seize the future leading position in the long term."
As fast as China's electric vehicle sales are rising, companies are pouring money into factories and research, often fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities. Nio, a top selling Chinese EV brand, said in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles.
BYD, which faces prohibitively high tariffs in the U.S. market, sells most of its cars in China but is expanding globally, particularly in Europe.
It announced in December that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, its first production facility for battery-powered cars in Europe. In Germany, the seat of European auto making, it introduced three models of electric cars at the start of 2023. BYD has opened dealerships in Germany, Norway and Sweden.
As global competition for electric vehicles has gotten more intense, the political ramifications have been heightened. United States policymakers have made it harder for foreign companies to become partners with American companies.
And in Europe, lawmakers are investigating China's state subsidies, a step that could lead to tariffs imposed by the European Union.
Yet Europe's auto industry can't ignore China as a customer and business partner.
BMW, which has more than 30,000 employees in China, announced last spring that it would invest about $ 1.4 billion in battery assembly capacity at its factory in Shenyang in China's northeast.
Volkswagen, which counts China as its largest sales market, is moving more of its supply chain and manufacturing to China. The German giant is hiring thousands of Chinese engineers to design electric cars at its industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China.

Can an Ambitious Public University Be a Place for All?: [Correction]

Full text: Stony Brook University, one of two state schools designated as flagships, has aggressively fund-raised and recruited students.
Shortly after she became governor of New York, Kathy Hochul made an announcement that caught the higher-education world off guard: The state, which has generally regarded all its public universities as equals, would start treating two universities as "flagships."
More surprising still, her choices for the elite label didn't include Binghamton University, which has often been regarded as New York's top academic public university. Instead, the governor said the distinction would go to Stony Brook University, on Long Island, and the University at Buffalo, in her hometown.
For leaders at Stony Brook, the promotion wasn't at all a surprise. It was the next step in a yearslong campaign to transform the institution from a well-regarded regional school, where nearly half the students are from Long Island, to a globally renowned research institution, or as administrators like to say, the "Berkeley of the East."
The flagship designation is only honorary. "It has rhetorical power, more than anything else," Stony Brook's president, Maurie McInnis, said in an interview. But in the two years since the announcement, Stony Brook has moved aggressively to live up to its new title, advertising its new status widely to recruit students and donors.
Its place in U.S. News & World Report's college rankings has jumped from No. 93 to No. 58. It has secured funds that will nearly triple its endowment, including one of the largest donations to a university in American history. And it won the rights to develop a climate solutions lab on a large chunk of real estate on Governors Island, beating out some of New York's largest and most prestigious institutions.
But some observers wonder whether the school's advancement will come at the cost of equity. They suggest that other schools in the State University of New York system could get short shrift. They also worry that Stony Brook, where 16 percent of students come from families in the bottom fifth of American income levels, could be transformed into a school that is more elite in every sense.
John Friedman, the chair of Brown University's economics department, who has done extensive research on the role of universities in promoting social mobility, said this kind of drift is all but inevitable: "I do think that making it more selective will make it more difficult to bring in the same number of low-income students as before."
The SUNY system as it exists today was established in the 1950s, cobbled together from teachers' colleges, agricultural schools and other existing institutions, including the University at Buffalo. Part of the original aim was to establish high-caliber public universities all over the state, so that no New Yorker would be far from one.
Stony Brook, which opened in 1957 as part of that effort, had a relatively modern design, a far cry from the stately, neo-Gothic style of some Ivy League schools, reflecting both its recent origins and its concentration on science and technology.
More than half of students are commuters, and it has never been known for having a robust campus culture. But even in the early days, leaders at both Stony Brook and Buffalo were ambitious.
Still, Stony Brook became known for its success at helping poor students: In 2017, it was ranked the third best in the nation for social mobility, according to metrics designed by Friedman and his colleagues. More than half of its students from low-income households end up in the top fifth of earners nationally after getting their degrees.
Equity has always been "part of Stony Brook's DNA," as Ms. McInnis put it. She said the school has often attracted faculty who appreciate its "public service mission."
When Stony Brook assembled a committee to choose a new president in late 2019, the leadership saw it as a chance to revive its global ambitions, said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of the IMAX Corporation and the chair of the university's fund-raising arm.
He said the trustees -- among them Jim Simons, who taught in the math department before making billions as a hedge fund manager -- sought out an administrator who understood the levers of power in public higher education.
Ms. McInnis, an art historian by background who joined in 2020, was a savvy veteran of two of America's most prestigious public universities, the University of Virginia and the University of Texas at Austin.
"She really knew how to navigate" this world, Mr. Gelfond said.
Early on, Ms. McInnis persuaded donors to set up a $ 75 million fund that she could personally use for "strategic opportunities." When, in the summer of 2021, the city announced it was launching a global competition for the Governors Island climate center, Ms. McInnis drew $ 7 million to assemble a detailed proposal. Stony Brook recruited a number of other institutions, including the Georgia Institute of Technology, Pratt Institute and IBM, to sign on as partners.
"When I saw that, I immediately knew that it was something we had to compete for -- and that, frankly, we had to win," she said.
They did. In the meantime, the governor bestowed the flagship label, choosing the state's two big research universities to receive it.
But legislators representing Binghamton and Albany were dismayed; at least five signed letters to the governor, expressing concerns that her decision would put their own local universities at a material disadvantage.
This past February, Ms. Hochul said she wanted the state to provide a 50 percent match for any donations made to the endowments at New York's four largest universities, which also included Binghamton and Albany. The Legislature passed the matching plan in the spring.
Four weeks later, Simons and his wife, Marilyn Simons, announced they were donating $ 500 million to Stony Brook -- believed to be the largest unrestricted donation an American public university has ever received.
The Stony Brook Foundation, the university's fund-raising arm, had lobbied for the state's matching program, Mr. Gelfond said, knowing it would help with appeals to donors -- and then used the program to persuade the Simonses to make the historic gift.
United University Professions, the union that represents professors and other employees at SUNY, is concerned that the new flagship designation will lead to the neglect of smaller institutions, like community colleges and technical schools, said Frederick Kowal, the union's statewide president. He said this has occurred in other states, like California, where public universities are grouped into distinct tiers.
For their part, leaders at Stony Brook and SUNY tend to argue that it's not a zero-sum game. If Stony Brook can bring in more federal research dollars, it could raise the profile of the SUNY system overall and spur economic development to boot, said John King, the SUNY chancellor.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Simons Foundation, Anastasia Greenebaum, said that they "do not regard support of Stony Brook as giving the school 'advantage' over other state schools, or creating tiers. Any one SUNY school receiving additional financial support so that it may excel does not lower or lessen other schools." They said that improvements to the university ultimately benefited the New Yorkers who can attend.
Prospective students and their parents also seem to be taking note of Stony Brook's growing stature. For the current academic year, the university received more than 50,000 freshman applications -- a 24 percent increase from the year before. The freshman class was also its largest ever, with 3,567 students. (Applications have also risen at other SUNY schools, thanks in part to an application fee waiver the state introduced last year.)
On one hand, the school's growing popularity is a sign of success. On the other hand, it raises concerns of balancing growth and inclusiveness.
"There's a ceiling in terms of the growth, even of a campus like Stony Brook," Mr. Kowal, the union president, said. "How big will they get? Are we talking about Ohio State, with tens of thousands of students, or are we talking Chapel Hill, which is smaller? At that point, it becomes more selective."
Stony Brook administrators noted that over the last decade, more low-income students have enrolled even as admissions have become more selective.
Ms. McInnis said she is focused on immediate concerns. As more money flows in, she said, the first priorities will be hiring more faculty and upgrading the oldest campus facilities. "The next president will love me -- and thank me," she said.
As to whether the growth could compromise the school's already established success as an engine of social mobility, Ms. McInnis said, "I guess that's something future leaders are going to have to keep an eye on."

no͞o kŏl-ər
A job that requires specialized skills, but not necessarily a college degree, and that is becoming more important in emerging high-tech fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
Step aside, blue collar. And white collar, pink collar and green collar.
There's a new collar in town.
"New collar" jobs are those that require advanced skills but not necessarily advanced degrees, especially in emerging high-tech fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, electric vehicles and robotics.
There are real fears that workers will lose jobs to technology, especially artificial intelligence, in the coming years. But "new collar" optimists (including those at companies looking to hire) frame things in a more positive light: There are also real opportunities ahead for skilled workers who know how to handle machines.
"Somebody has to program, monitor and maintain those robots," said Sarah Boisvert, the founder of the New Collar Network, a national work force training program based in New Mexico.
Even if millions of high-tech jobs are created in the coming years, the disruption to workers who lose jobs may be significant. For the many Americans without four-year college degrees -- more than half of adults, according to census data -- the new job market will require training.
Ginni Rometty, a former chief executive of IBM, is credited with coining "new collar" in 2016. At the time, she said, IBM was having trouble filling cybersecurity jobs, partly because outdated criteria required that candidates have college degrees.
"Because we overcredentialed for those cyber jobs, we were overlooking an entire pool of qualified, available candidates," she wrote in an email. "Unless millions of people are trained in the skills employers need now," she added, "they risk being unemployed even as millions of good-paying jobs go unfilled."
Many employers seem to have gotten the message. Hiring managers are increasingly using skills-based filters on LinkedIn to find candidates, a LinkedIn spokeswoman said, adding that 155 million of the platform's more than 930 million users are workers without four-year degrees.
"Having a pithy term that helps companies get energized about doing something innovative is helpful," said Colleen Ammerman, the director of the Race, Gender and Equity Initiative at Harvard Business School. She pointed to the electric vehicles industry as an example that will require many skilled workers. (In the past, these may have been hailed as "green collar" jobs.)
In 2017, 2019 and 2021, the House introduced -- but didn't pass -- versions of the New Collar Jobs Act, which aimed to promote jobs and training in fields like cybersecurity.
"It's great there are alternative models to four-year college," said Christopher M. Cox, a researcher who has written about the new collar economy. But he added that "new collar" might also be a clever term to downplay workers' anxieties, by framing the changing labor market and tech companies' ventures as more utopia, less "The Terminator."

Beijing-Washington Spy Competition Escalates: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Chinese spies wanted more. In meetings during the pandemic with Chinese technology contractors, they complained that surveillance cameras tracking foreign diplomats, military officers and intelligence operatives in Beijing's embassy district fell short of their needs.
The spies asked for an artificial intelligence program that would create instant dossiers on every person of interest in the area and analyze their behavior patterns. They proposed feeding the A.I. program information from databases and scores of cameras that would include car license plates, cellphone data, contacts and more.
The A.I.-generated profiles would allow the Chinese spies to select targets and pinpoint their networks and vulnerabilities, according to internal meeting memos obtained by The New York Times.
The spies' interest in the technology, disclosed here for the first time, reveals some of the vast ambitions of the Ministry of State Security, China's main intelligence agency. In recent years, it has built itself up through wider recruitment, including of American citizens. The agency has also sharpened itself through better training, a bigger budget and the use of advanced technologies to try to fulfill the goal of Xi Jinping, China's leader, for the nation to rival the United States as the world's pre-eminent economic and military power.
The Chinese agency, known as the M.S.S., once rife with agents whose main source of information was gossip at embassy dinner parties, is now going toe-to-toe with the Central Intelligence Agency in collection and subterfuge around the world.
Today the Chinese agents in Beijing have what they asked for: an A.I. system that tracks American spies and others, said U.S. officials and a person with knowledge of the transaction, who shared the information on the condition that The Times not disclose the names of the contracting firms involved. At the same time, as spending on China at the C.I.A. has doubled since the start of the Biden administration, the United States has sharply stepped up its spying on Chinese companies and their technological advances.
This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former American officials, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, and a review of internal Chinese corporate documents and public M.S.S. documents.
A Game of Ghosts
The competition between the American and Chinese spy agencies harks back to the K.G.B.-versus-C.I.A. rivalry of the Cold War. In that era, the Soviets built an agency that could pilfer America's most closely held secrets and run covert operations while also producing formidable political leaders, including Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia.
But there is a notable difference. Because of China's economic boom and industrial policies, the M.S.S. is able to use emerging technologies like A.I. to challenge American spymasters in a way the Soviets could not. And those technologies are top prizes in espionage efforts by China and the United States.
"For China in particular, exploiting the existing technology or trade secrets of others has become a popular shortcut encouraged by the government," said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute. "The urgency and intensity of technological espionage have increased significantly."
The M.S.S. has intensified its intelligence collection on American companies developing technology with both military and civilian uses, while the C.I.A., in a change from even a few years ago, is pouring resources into collecting data on Chinese companies developing A.I., quantum computing and other such tools.
Though the U.S. intelligence community has long collected economic intelligence, gathering detailed information on commercial technological advances outside of defense companies was once the kind of espionage the United States avoided.
But information about China's development of emerging technologies is now considered as important as divining its conventional military might or the machinations of its leaders.
David Cohen, the agency's deputy director, said that under President Biden, the C.I.A. was making investments and reorganizing to meet the challenge of collecting on Chinese advances. The agency has started both a China mission center and a technology intelligence center.
"We've been counting tanks and understanding the capability of missiles for longer than we have been as sharply focused on the capability of semiconductors or A.I. algorithms or biotech equipment," Mr. Cohen said in an interview.
But some policymakers say privately that the effort is still falling short, and that Chinese companies and the military are surprising the U.S. government with their advances.
In China, the status of the Ministry of State Security has only grown under Mr. Xi, who prizes bold intelligence action and a powerful security state.
In October 2022, the Communist Party promoted the ministry's head, Chen Wenqing, to be the party's top security official and a member of the 24-member Politburo, the first spy chief in decades to ascend to that body. His replacement, Chen Yixin, a longtime aide to Mr. Xi, has raised the public profile of the M.S.S. He has also been given a broad mandate, which encompasses leading a crackdown on American and other foreign companies that conduct corporate investigations of Chinese firms, including for military ties and human rights violations.
The ministry has the foreign responsibilities of the C.I.A. and the domestic mandate of the F.B.I., combined with an authoritarian edge. The M.S.S. is charged with carrying out intelligence collection and operations overseas, as well as limiting foreign influence within China and clamping down on so-called subversive activities. Its mission is avowedly political: to defend the Communist Party against all perceived threats.
The current minister, Mr. Chen, has repeatedly emphasized loyalty to Mr. Xi. In June, he told officers to "wholeheartedly embrace" Mr. Xi's "core" status.
Under Mr. Chen, the ministry is embracing social media to spread messages about threats. "The United States' multifaceted obstruction, containment and suppression will only make China more battle hardened and self-reliant," it said on a new WeChat account.
In August, the ministry made separate announcements asserting that it had caught two Chinese citizens spying for the C.I.A., one recruited by an American agent in Japan and the other in Italy. In October, the ministry and Chinese state television announced a case in which a researcher at a defense industry institute had been recruited by a U.S. agent while he was a visiting scholar at an American university. He then transferred copies of secret documents to the Americans after he returned to China, before being detained in 2021.
The announcements suggested the C.I.A. had been rebuilding a network within China that Chinese counterintelligence officers decimated more than a decade ago.
The C.I.A. does not say whether people detained overseas on espionage charges are spies for the United States. But at least some of the Chinese citizens detained were working for the United States, according to people briefed on American intelligence reports. There is no evidence, however, that the M.S.S. has cracked the network, they said, and the Italy case is more than a year old.
The M.S.S. is making its own aggressive moves abroad, including recruiting a far-right Belgian politician and harassing ethnic Chinese critics of the party. One agent hired a local private investigator to physically attack a Chinese American candidate for U.S. Congress on Long Island, according to a Justice Department indictment. Another man is accused of helping to set up an organization in New York that lured in dissidents.
A Chinese Agency on the Offense
The central government in Beijing established the Ministry of State Security in 1983 during a reshuffling of security units. For decades, the agency struggled to win favor with party leaders. Its Chinese rival, the intelligence services of the People's Liberation Army, had greater resources and better tradecraft, especially in cyberespionage.
The Ministry of State Security gradually improved its tactics, got bigger budgets and even built business expertise. Some M.S.S. officers who would be working under cover as business people were sent to private sector offices for training, said Peter Mattis, a former C.I.A. analyst and co-author of a book on Chinese espionage.
Chinese agents also expanded their foreign recruitment targets, including among U.S. citizens.
U.S. intelligence agencies were alarmed after discovering that the Shanghai M.S.S. had recruited an American student in China, Glenn Duffie Shriver, and got him to apply to the C.I.A. and State Department. Mr. Shriver was sentenced in 2011 to four years in prison. "It was a big sign of improved tradecraft from M.S.S., for the first time targeting non-Chinese Americans and attempting penetration of the U.S. intelligence community," said John Culver, a former U.S. intelligence analyst.
The case has had far-reaching consequences. It made U.S. counterintelligence officers more suspicious of applicants for U.S. government jobs who had studied in China or had contacts there, and it turned their attention to M.S.S. provincial bureaus.
The bureaus are their own fiefs, based outside of the agency's national headquarters, which is in the secretive Xiyuan compound of northwest Beijing. Under Mr. Xi, they have become more aggressive in operations overseas, with some specializing in recruiting and running informants in the United States.
The bureau in Jiangsu Province, next to Shanghai, is another one focused on getting American secrets, and particularly defense technologies, U.S. officials said.
Its officers recruited Ji Chaoqun shortly before he went to the United States in 2013 to study engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, according to the Justice Department and court documents. His M.S.S. handler, Xu Yanjun, got him to provide the names of at least nine people in the United States for the Chinese spy agency to try to recruit to get aerospace and satellite technologies.
Mr. Ji eventually joined the U.S. Army Reserves, where he aimed to get a security clearance so he could eventually apply to work in the C.I.A., F.B.I. or N.A.S.A. He was arrested in Chicago in 2018 and sentenced this year to eight years in prison. Mr. Xu, his handler, was arrested in Brussels in 2018, in a related operation run by the F.B.I., becoming the first M.S.S. agent to be extradited to the United States.
Unlike Russian operatives, M.S.S. case officers generally avoid working undercover in the United States, preferring instead to run agents or assets from outside and recruit online, including using jobs ads with no apparent ties to China, U.S. officials said.
Around 2018, a Singaporean agent for the M.S.S. "created a fake consulting company that used the same name as a prominent U.S. consulting firm and posted online job ads under that company name," said Michael C. Casey, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center.
The Scramble for Tech
The M.S.S. often directly hires from universities, especially for core positions, according to a review of more than 30 online job ads from the agency. In recent years, it has sought technology experts, including hackers, according to two people with knowledge of the recruiting efforts.
Beijing's most acute worry is that the United States and its allies could choke China off from technological know-how vital for economic and military growth. Mr. Xi has stressed that risk.
Mr. Chen, the minister of state security, wrote in an article in September that "core technologies" remained under the control of other nations, and that reaching "technological self-reliance" was an urgent task.
Chinese government experts openly admire the collection capabilities of American spy agencies and their technology. Chinese intelligence journals often carry studies examining U.S. operations. A recent study of U.S. national security services by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, the main M.S.S. research institute, said, "Drawing on an in-depth assessment of the relevant methods of the United States, China should choose what works and dispense with what does not."
The M.S.S. has also been elevating experts on the United States. Early this year, one such analyst, Yuan Peng, president of the main research institute, appeared under a new name, Yuan Yikun, as a vice minister of the ministry itself. Earlier in his career, Mr. Yuan often mixed with American scholars, some of whom saw him as a coolheaded observer of Washington.
While president of the research institute, Mr. Yuan became a champion of Mr. Xi's sweeping concept of "overall national security," which casts the United States as the main threat to China's ascent.
"Biden said 'America is back,' but the world is not the same as it was, and if it can't keep up with massive global changes, then this changing world will inevitably slip from U.S. control," Mr. Yuan wrote in an international strategy assessment published in early 2022. "In judging current American grand strategy a few decades from now, its biggest mistake may be seen as choosing China as an enemy."
'Think Like a Wall Street Analyst'
One of the first major decisions by William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, was to create the China Mission Center. The idea was to ensure that stations all over the world, not just in Asia, focused on collecting intelligence on China.
Mr. Burns took the step after a strategic review that was led by Michael Collins, a career intelligence officer. Under Mr. Burns, Mr. Collins was appointed director of strategy, with a mandate to help improve the agency's work on China.
The China challenge requires the United States "to be smart on critical domains like biotechnology and semiconductors," said Mr. Collins, who now leads the National Intelligence Council, a coordinating body across spy agencies. "We have to be better."
To get a sharper understanding of which technologies China is targeting, the C.I.A. has begun asking American executives and scholars for insights about what Chinese companies are trying to develop. American universities and companies, often approached by Chinese investors and researchers, have knowledge of the specific technologies, U.S. officials said.
But officials said it was important to bring in people with deeper knowledge of China's commercial and technological ambitions. For now the spy agencies are struggling to get information to policymakers as quickly as they want it.
Last year, a Canadian firm, TechInsights, revealed that China's leading chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, had developed a seven-nanometer chip. The U.S. government was unaware of the advance and was surprised that the Chinese firm had made the leap so quickly, said Jimmy Goodrich, an expert on Chinese technology who advises the RAND Corporation.
"The intelligence community is just not set up institutionally to be adept at understanding China's commercial and tech issues," he said "It's hard to do. And more important, you really have to think like a Wall Street analyst, market researcher, talking to everyone up and down the supply chain."
(A U.S. official said American intelligence agencies had assessed that the company had at least the capability to produce the smaller chip before the Canadian report.)
Part of the problem is that U.S. intelligence agencies favor information from satellites, intercept programs and human spies. One senior U.S. official said analysts were overlooking valuable insight from nonclassified sources in China.
"The U.S. intelligence community can do amazing things on focused targets," said Mr. Mattis, the former C.I.A. analyst. "But it sometimes can struggle with broad-based awareness like understanding China's technology prowess."

His MSS handler, Xu Yanjun, got him to provide the names of at least nine people in the United States for the Chinese spy agency to try to recruit to get aerospace and satellite technologies.
Ji eventually joined the U.S. Army Reserves, where he aimed to get a security clearance so he could eventually apply to work in the CIA, FBI or NASA. He was arrested in Chicago in 2018 and sentenced this year to eight years in prison. Xu, his handler, was arrested in Brussels in 2018, in a related operation run by the FBI, becoming the first MSS agent to be extradited to the United States.
The MSS often directly hires from universities. In recent years, it has sought technology experts, including hackers, according to two people with knowledge of the recruiting efforts.
Beijing’s most acute worry is that the United States and its allies could choke China off from technological know-how vital for economic and military growth.
The MSS has been elevating experts on the United States. Early this year, one such analyst, Yuan Peng, president of the main research institute, appeared under a new name, Yuan Yikun, as a vice minister of the ministry itself. Earlier in his career, Yuan often mixed with U.S. scholars, some of whom saw him as a coolheaded observer of Washington.
While president of the research institute, Yuan became a champion of Xi’s sweeping concept of “overall national security,” which casts the United States as the main threat to China’s ascent.
“Biden said ‘America is back,’ but the world is not the same as it was, and if it can’t keep up with massive global changes, then this changing world will inevitably slip from U.S. control,” Yuan wrote in an international strategy assessment published in early 2022. “In judging current American grand strategy a few decades from now, its biggest mistake may be seen as choosing China as an enemy.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Koo Bon-moo, chairman of South Korean conglomerate LG, died in 2018, there wasn't much question, at least publicly, of who would next preside over the company.
LG, a $ 10 billion corporate empire, is governed by the principle of male primogeniture. Succession was effectively settled 14 years earlier when Mr. Koo and his wife adopted their eldest nephew, Koo Kwang-mo. The adoption was necessitated by tragedy and tradition after the couple's teenage son died in 1994, and their efforts for another male heir resulted in a second daughter.
The Koo family has controlled LG since it was founded in 1947, and the transition that elevated Kwang-mo to the helm seemed seamless, burnishing the family's reputation for harmony.
It wasn't.
The former chairman died, at age 73, without a will. What followed was a power struggle within the Koo family and LG over the inheritance of his estimated $ 1.5 billion fortune -- including his 11 percent stake in the company. Now, five years later, the former chairman's widow and two daughters are suing Koo Kwang-mo, accusing him and other LG executives of deception to steal their rightful inheritance to bolster his claim to the company.
The women said they want their full inheritance, but they are not seeking control of LG.
The lawsuit not only pits the matriarch of one of South Korea's wealthiest families and her daughters against the adopted male heir, who is now one of the country's most influential business figures. It also challenges LG's patriarchal tradition that allows the oldest male successor to seize power and wealth, leaving female family members as afterthoughts in the company.
Omnipresent in South Korea, LG is a holding company comprising 11 publicly traded businesses, including LG Chem, the country's largest materials and chemicals firm, and LG Electronics, whose televisions, dishwashers and other home appliances are popular worldwide.
The Koo family is one of a few wealthy clans -- along with the Lee family at Samsung, Hyundai's Chung family and SK's Chey family -- who run the conglomerates known as chaebols that have dominated South Korea's economy for decades.
In a legal filing that reads like a Korean drama script involving one of the country's biggest corporate employers, the former chairman's widow, Kim Young-shik, and her daughters, Koo Yeon-kyung and Koo Yeon-sue, accused LG executives of colluding with Koo Kwang-mo and his biological father to swindle them.
In transcripts of secretly recorded conversations filed in the legal documents, Koo Kwang-mo pleads with his adopted mother not to challenge the inheritance because it will hurt LG's image and his leadership of the company, potentially tarnishing his reputation among the Korean public.
"The scariest thing is the public opinion," he said, according to the transcript. "How are they going to look at this situation? 'Someone got greedy,' or that I didn't come visit and do a good job of caring for my mother."
In addition, the women accused Ha Beom-jong, the former chairman's aide and now LG's president, of misleading them to believe that there was a will that left everything to Koo Kwang-mo. Without a will, South Korean law states, the widow would be entitled to inherit one-third of the estate with the remainder divided equally between the two daughters and Kwang-mo.
Instead, the women said they were duped into an agreement in which roughly 75 percent of the estate went to Kwang-mo. The lawsuit, filed in Seoul Western District Court, seeks to redistribute the estate according to the legal standard.
"We cannot stand having our rights, protected under the constitution and the law, be disregarded just because we are women," the women said in a notice filed with the lawsuit.
Yulchon LLC, a law firm representing Kwang-mo, said in a statement that the inheritance is "a legally settled matter" that was resolved four years ago after extensive negotiations, and that there have been about 10 rounds of consultations and several revisions since the chairman's death. It also noted Ms. Kim had signed a document agreeing that Kwang-mo should receive the LG shares and assets related to controlling the company.
While LG is not a party to the lawsuit, it has also staged a vigorous defense of Kwang-mo in public statements. LG also suggested that the women were trying to challenge Koo Kwang-mo for company control, something that they deny.
"Any attempt to shake LG's tradition and management rights cannot be tolerated," the company said in a statement earlier this year.
LG's Deep Roots
The Koo lawsuit is one of several recent legal proceedings involving chaebols that highlight the challenges of family succession and control.
Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's executive chairman, is entangled in a criminal case accusing him of breaking the law to clear the way for the merger of two group affiliates that helped strengthen his control of the company. Mr. Lee has denied any wrongdoing.
Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK, the conglomerate behind the country's biggest mobile carrier, is embroiled in a divorce after 34 years of marriage. Last year, a Seoul court awarded his former wife about $ 50 million -- roughly 1 percent of his net worth -- but not any of his 17.5 percent stake in the company. She is appealing the ruling.
Woochan Kim, a finance professor at Korea University Business School, said these legal disputes will make it harder for the conglomerates to maintain control within the family.
"Family succession will cease to exist for very large Korean chaebols," Dr. Kim said.
LG was founded by Koo In-hwoi, Kwang-mo's great-grandfather, when the country was still emerging from Japanese colonial rule, and rival governments were being formed in the north and south, setting the stage for the Korean War. Originally called Lak Hui (pronounced "lucky") Chemical, the company's breakthrough product was a cosmetics cream. After changing its name to Lucky Goldstar, it produced goods for a modernizing Korea, including the country's first toothpaste, radio and washing machine.
By the time Koo Bon-moo, the founder's grandson and the oldest son of six siblings, took over in 1995, the company, now called LG, was deeply embedded in Korean life. LG built apartments, established an economic research institute and started a baseball team.
A year before Mr. Koo became chairman, his 19-year-old son died of a heart attack a few days after his high school graduation, leaving the family with one daughter but no male heir. Ms. Kim, the chairman's widow, said they tried for another son. Two years later, in her mid-40s, she gave birth to a daughter, Yeon-sue.
In a statement, Yeon-sue, now a 27-year-old musician, said that for her parents, the pain of losing a son was compounded by the succession issue.
"That's the way it is in my family," she wrote. "I used to feel guilty about the fact that I wasn't born a son."
Without a male heir, Ms. Kim said her father-in-law pressured them to adopt Kwang-mo -- then 26. He was the oldest son of Bon-moo's eldest brother, Koo Bon-neung. A decade after her son's death, Ms. Kim said she and her husband relented.
"For my father-in-law, that was really important," she said.
In 2017, Bon-moo was 72 and still seemed healthy, planning for the company's future and hiking on the weekends. He went to the doctor because his face appeared slightly lopsided, and he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.
Bon-moo's brain surgery in April 2017 went smoothly but after a second operation in December, he suffered a seizure that left him unable to speak, sending his health into a downward spiral. He died in May 2018.
His death raised a possible succession battle. During his illness, the company was being run by one of his other brothers, Koo Bon-joon, who had led one of LG's most high-profile businesses. Koo Kwang-mo, who was 40 at the time, had been an LG executive for a decade but had accrued little management experience.
Bon-moo's ashes were scattered among trees, as was his wish. In the blur of the funeral proceedings, his wife and daughters claim, Kwang-mo's biological father and LG officials started angling for control.
Without notifying them, the women say, Kwang-mo's biological father and LG officials enlisted a locksmith to help them pry open the former chairman's safes at the company office and a vacation home.
Then Mr. Ha, who had been Bon-moo's aide, and another employee came to the family's stately home in Seoul and told them that the senior Koo had left a will, according to the women in interviews with The Times. His wishes, they recalled the employees telling them, were that all his shares and the chairmanship go to his adopted son, in keeping with family custom since LG's founding. Mr. Ha has denied in court testimony that he ever told the family there was a will.
"The person my father trusted the most and supposedly knew everything came to us and said there was a will, and based on that, it all goes to Kwang-mo," Koo Yeon-kyung, the eldest daughter, 45, said in an interview.
Succession Question
While LG is a publicly traded company with 220,000 employees, its finance department does more than handle the company's books. It also manages the personal assets and bank accounts of family members. Employees kept the personal seals for family members and routinely inked documents on their behalf.
In court testimony, Mr. Ha said that there wasn't a will but a memo with Bon-moo's wishes signed a few days before his first surgery. It was later shredded in the routine destruction of documents, he said, adding that he showed it to the women and Kwang-mo shortly after the former chairman's death. The women say they never saw it.
Ms. Kim, 71, said she was told she needed to forgo inheriting any of her husband's shares to ensure Kwang-mo's succession and prevent any challenge from her late husband's brother, Bon-joon. She said she went along with it, but she questioned Mr. Ha about whether Bon-moo truly wanted his daughters to receive no shares. She said Kwang-mo eventually agreed to give roughly a fifth of Bon-moo's shares, worth about $ 270 million by current share prices, to his two sisters.
They said while the older Koo was alive, they never questioned the family's patriarchal ways. Their expectation, they said, was that Kwang-mo, as his adoptive father and grandfather had before him, would make sure everyone in their extended family was financially taken care of and would carry out ancestral rites that are Korean tradition.
Yeon-kyung, the eldest daughter, said she was told that the terms of the inheritance should be guarded with utmost secrecy, so much so that she didn't talk to her husband or consult an attorney. The agreement was read out to her and her mother once, and they were never given a copy, she said.
The women said that they were told that they would receive the former chairman's cash, other investments and the family's home in Seoul, and that Kwang-mo would pay hundreds of millions of dollars in inheritance tax. South Korea levies a tax of at least 50 percent on inherited assets over $ 2.3 million.
Through the agreement, Kwang-mo strengthened his claim to be chairman. Before the former chairman's death, Kwang-mo owned 6.1 percent of LG shares. Koo Bon-joon, the brother who was running the company, held 7.6 percent. By inheriting most of the former chairman's stock, Kwang-mo's stake grew to about 15 percent.
He became the chairman of LG in June 2018. Bon-joon agreed to leave the company, but he wouldn't go away empty-handed.
LG announced in November 2020 that it was going to spin off five affiliate businesses into a new holding company with Bon-joon as the chairman.
The U.S. hedge fund Whitebox Advisors protested the move, calling it a "solution to a succession problem" that gave priority to family needs but went against the interests of outside investors in the company.
In response, Mr. Ha, the former aide who was now promoted to LG's chief financial officer, told investors the plan "will diversify investment risk and provide an opportunity" for LG and the new company.
Shareholders approved the spinoff. Shares of the new company, LX Holdings, started to trade publicly in May 2021. Bon-joon sold most of his LG shares later that year and used the proceeds to buy shares in his new company.
"Running a public company as a private fiefdom for the benefit of a controlling shareholder adversely affects minority investors and is a disincentive for outside investment," Simon Waxley, head of equity arbitrage at Whitebox, said in a statement to The New York Times.
Inheritance Dispute
The women said they continued living their lives normally. Yeon-kyung, who studied social work, said she remembered her father's wishes that she get involved in running LG's charitable foundations, and started working at one of them as an adviser in 2021.
Around that time, Yeon-kyung said, she felt something was amiss when she applied for a store credit card to get a discount on a gift for a friend, but was rejected because she had too many loans. She said that came as a surprise to her.
Realizing how little she, her sister and her mother knew about their own finances, she started going from bank to bank to pull years' worth of statements. There were large inheritance tax payments and loans against their LG shares that didn't comport with their understanding that Kwang-mo alone would shoulder the tax. When they started asking questions to LG's finance team, they felt they were getting partial or evasive answers, Yeon-kyung said.
They were told a copy of the inheritance agreement was kept in storage away from Seoul and would take weeks to retrieve.
As the women pieced together the state of their finances, they said, they realized that Kwang-mo had also received more cash and investment assets than they thought they had agreed to.
"Isn't that strange, it was our money but we didn't know how much we had," Yeon-kyung said. "It started to seem odd."
Growing mistrustful, Yeon-kyung said she and her mother began secretly recording conversations with Kwang-mo and Mr. Ha in 2022. Throughout the year, the exchanges grew tense, and at times, emotional, according to excerpts from transcripts, which the plaintiffs have cited as evidence that they were misled by the men now running LG.
In one recording from November 2022, Ms. Kim complained to Kwang-mo that they were treated by the finance staff as if they could be ignored because they were women.
"All this time has passed, and now that we look into it, so much was done without our knowledge," she said, according to a transcript.
"The 'our' you mention doesn't include me, right?" Kwang-mo asked in return.
Kwang-mo sent his mother a letter in January clarifying the unexplained withdrawals from her accounts. He said that, unbeknown to him, "the employees" were short on funds to pay the inheritance tax under his name, so they paid it under her name using her assets, but that they had planned to pay her back. Still, he asked her not to assert her inheritance rights.
"If the elders each asserted their rights under the inheritance law, LG's management control would not have been passed down to the 4th generation as it is now," he wrote in the letter.
A month later, the women filed suit.
In September, Kwang-mo came to the family home for Chuseok, a major Korean mid-autumn holiday, when more than 100 extended family members got together for the customary ancestral rites.
The family carried out the elaborate ceremony, paying their respects to deceased family members as they always had, but an awkwardness hung between Kwang-mo and his adoptive mother and sisters. He seemed to avoid them, ducking into different rooms in the cavernous home, the women said.
"He didn't make eye contact, or talk," Ms. Kim said. "He just hurriedly left."

Full text: Conglomerates that sprawl across the society trace their roots to the nation's rise into a world power and have been tightly controlled for generations.
For decades, South Korea's economy has been dominated by a handful of family-run conglomerates that hold outsize wealth and influence and factor into nearly every aspect of life in the country.
Because of their political heft, the chaebol, as these families are known, have long been a matter of immense public interest. The marriages, deaths, estrangements and legal troubles of these families are chronicled in the South Korean press. Fictional chaebol families have been depicted in Korean dramas. The Lee family of Samsung, the Koos of LG, the Cheys of SK, the Shins of Lotte and the Chungs of Hyundai are household names that have tightly held the reins of the companies that are some of the country's largest private sector employers.
Their power has been increasingly scrutinized -- both inside and outside South Korea -- as an economic vulnerability, deepening inequalities and fostering corruption.
Chaebol families have controlled South Korea's biggest companies for generations.
The chaebol system is a legacy of South Korea's history. After an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953, the country's military dictators anointed a handful of families for special loans and financial support to rebuild the economy. The companies expanded quickly and moved from industry to industry until they morphed into sprawling conglomerates.
Even as the companies grew in size, wealth and influence, and sold shares on stock exchanges, they remained under family control -- typically run by a chairman who also presided as head of the family. Generational leadership changes have sometimes unsettled chaebol families, forcing companies to split or spin off into smaller groups.
More than two decades ago, during a family struggle, Hyundai was divided among the founder's six sons. The eldest son took control of Hyundai Motor, now one of South Korea's biggest companies. Under Chung Eui-sun, the founder's grandson, the family is still in charge of the global automaker.
These conglomerates make up a sizable portion of South Korea's economy.
South Korea's rapid rise from postwar poverty to a major developed economy in a couple of decades was closely tied to the rise of chaebol companies. Their early successes boosted wages and living standards, and drove the country's exports.
The total sales of the five largest conglomerates have consistently made up more than half of South Korea's gross domestic product in the past 15 years, topping 70 percent in 2012, according to the book "Republic of Chaebol" by the economist Park Sang-in. Their businesses also permeate South Korean life -- from hospitals to life insurance, from apartment complexes to credit cards and retail, from food to entertainment and media, not to mention electronics.
Chaebol families have had cozy relationships with the political leadership.
Patronage from political leaders was crucial to the chaebol companies' growth into industrial conglomerates, particularly under the regime of Park Chung-hee, who came to power in a coup and ran the country for two decades until his assassination in 1979. For Mr. Park, the chaebol were an instrumental part of his ambition to enrich and industrialize South Korea. To that end, his government steered funds to companies that were cooperative with his agenda, protected them from competition and spared them of public accountability.
While the close ties between the government and the businesses have lessened in recent decades, political leaders still frequently turn to them for support or counsel. In turn, the companies have at times been shielded as being too vital to the economy to be broken up or scrutinized -- something critics have assailed as a "too big to jail" problem.
This summer, chaebol heads traveled with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, on a trip to Europe as part of South Korea's bid for the World Expo. They also accompanied him on his visit to the United States to meet with President Biden and were among the guests at a White House state dinner.
Several scandals have tarnished their public image.
Chaebol companies have become enmeshed in political corruption cases.
One of South Korea's biggest political scandals in recent years demonstrated the close ties between the political leaders and the family-run conglomerates.
Park Geun-hye, the country's former president, was ousted from office in 2017 and later sentenced to prison after she was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and other criminal charges. Ms. Park and a longtime confidante were found to have collected or demanded bribes from three chaebol conglomerates: Samsung, SK and Lotte. Ms. Park was pardoned in 2021 after serving almost five years of a 20-year prison sentence.
Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest chaebol, was also sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for his role. He was paroled and later pardoned by President Yoon in 2022, a move that allowed him to return to running the company.

An obituary on Sunday about the China scholar Merle Goldman misspelled the given name of the author of "The Theory of the Leisure Class." He was Thorstein Veblen, not Thorsten.
An obituary on Nov. 30 about Charles T. Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime partner in the investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, mistakenly included two names on a list of companies partly owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Although the company once held stakes in IBM and Wells Fargo, it no longer does. The obituary also misstated part of the name of a company in which Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett began investing early in their professional association. It was Wesco Financial, not Westco. And it misstated part of the name of a law firm Mr. Munger helped found in 1962. Although it is now known as Munger, Tolles & Olson, it was originally Munger, Tolles & Hills.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, engineers at Convex, a Russian telecommunications company, needed to find American equipment to transmit data to the country's feared intelligence service. But no gear was flowing in after Western nations imposed sweeping new trade limits on Russia.
Convex's employees soon found a solution.
While Cisco, a U.S. tech provider, had halted sales to Russia on March 3, 2022, Convex's engineers easily obtained the Cisco gear they needed through an obscure Russian e-commerce site called Nag, which had gotten around international trade restrictions by buying the American equipment through a web of suppliers in China.
Convex engineers then visited the offices of Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., in Yekaterinburg to install the gear that would help categorize and send data to the authorities. "Coordinate with the F.S.B. the placement of the Cisco Catalyst WS-C4948E switch," a Convex engineer wrote on March 23, 2022, according to a company communications log obtained by The New York Times.
In the 22 months since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has largely continued getting the technology it needs to keep its economy running. After export restrictions and corporate bans initially led to trade disruptions, Russian suppliers found loopholes and cultivated workarounds. Almost no piece of commercial hardware -- including basic telecom equipment, surveillance gear, microchips for advanced computing and weapons systems, and drones -- has been too hard to get.
Russian authorities and companies have united to take advantage of cracks in the global response. They have tapped webs of intermediaries, including middlemen in China, and disguised their activity through shell companies, according to leaked Russian government emails, trade documents and records of online conversations between Russian engineers obtained by The Times.
They have also turned to countries that have staked out neutral positions in the conflict, such as Morocco and Turkey, and used their ports to receive goods from global tech manufacturing centers that are then placed on other ships headed toward Russia, a process known as transshipment. The prohibited tech products were then made available to buy from well-known suppliers and on easy-to-use e-commerce sites like Nag.
Flexibility has been paramount. In weekly emails, Russian trade officials shared tips on which ports would transfer goods, who would trade in rubles and where Russian-flagged ships could be repaired, the documents show. If one supplier stopped selling, they found another. If a shipping route was cut off, new ones took up the slack.
The documents offer a rare glimpse of a race in which Russian traders have reliably stayed one step ahead of U.S.-led efforts to cut them off. Their success shows how difficult it is to stop the global movement of commercial technology, raising questions about the effectiveness of Western trade restrictions and whether tech giants should better control the destinations of their products -- and if it is even possible to do so.
Cisco declined to comment. Convex did not respond to requests for comment.
Understaffed government investigators in the United States and Europe cannot keep pace with the often shadowy flow of goods, said Elina Ribakova, an economist who has studied sanctions evasion at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a U.S. think tank. Major tech companies, she added, must do more to cut off supplies to Russia.
"It's an endless Whac-a-Mole game," she said. "There should be alarm, particularly among the policymakers, that we have announced a lot of sanctions and may believe they are working but in reality they are not."
A Beautiful Friendship
As sanctions against Russia took effect last year, ProSoft, a Moscow-based electronics provider, experienced the fallout.
Officials at the company, which sells biometric surveillance equipment and tech for heavy industry and critical infrastructure, emailed the Russian government trade mission in Morocco for help, according to a message reviewed by The Times.
"Just a week ago, it was not difficult to ship them to us from American and European suppliers," a ProSoft executive wrote, referring to now-banned tech. Now "we run the risk of starting to reduce production (there are small reserves in the warehouse)."
A spreadsheet attached to the message listed hundreds of American, European and Japanese microchips and sensors that ProSoft needed.
At the time, Russia's economy was absorbing the initial effects of trade restrictions. The ruble tumbled, inflation and interest rates soared, Russian banks were cut off from large swaths of the global financial system and oligarchs sat helpless as their yachts were seized.
But the pain did not last as President Vladimir V. Putin remade Russia's economy. Russian officials and executives swiftly teamed up to find workarounds. Political loyalists profited as Western companies fled.
In Morocco, Russia's trade office, which looks after the country's economic interests overseas, also helped Russian companies regain their footing. After ProSoft reached out for help, trade officials jumped into action.
"We're in constant contact with the general director" of Morocco's state-run port of Tanger Med, one Russian official wrote in an April 2022 email. "In the event of ships entering under the Russian flag, there will be no problems with maintenance."
A spokeswoman for Tanger Med, which hugs the Strait of Gibraltar, said the port leased space to shipping companies and had "no information nor responsibility" about vessels moving through the complex. The port, which handles more than eight million containers annually connecting to 180 international ports, was "not aware" of shipped goods calling at Russian ports before or after being at Tanger Med, or maintenance of Russian ships being performed, she added.
By November 2022, Russian trade officials in Morocco were bragging that their "direct support" had turned the African country into an electronics transshipment hub. Goods from Taiwan, China and other manufacturing centers were offloaded at Tanger Med and then placed on other ships headed to Russia.
"Given the long-term nature of the cooperation with the Moroccan partner, the volume of supplies could amount to about $ 10 million per year," the trade officials wrote about their work for ProSoft.
ProSoft also maintained supplies of Western tech with the help of an obscure scrap metal company registered in Casablanca, Morocco. After the war began, the company, Invent Maroc, set up a new website and routed restricted technology through Morocco to Russia, including microchips from Texas Instruments, Intel and NXP, according to trade data. In 2022, the United States had limited the export of semiconductors made with American equipment or intellectual property to Russia.
Invent Maroc, run by a man named Alexander Trinz, had no prior history of international exports. Yet it sourced electronics from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Japan and Mexico, according to trade records.
In a call this month, Mr. Trinz said he had supplied technology to Russia in the past, but not since the war. "Before, we worked with Russia, but in this moment we can't," he said.
An analysis of ProSoft's offerings found nearly 300 products for sale that contain Intel chips, as well as components made by Nvidia and an A.I. optimized computer chip designed by Google. Although it is unclear how the imports were ultimately used, American chips have been found on Russian missiles and drones, according to weapons experts.
Nvidia, Intel and Google declined to comment. Texas Instruments said it opposed "the illicit diversion of our products to Russia." ProSoft, NXP and Russia's trade representative to Morocco did not respond to requests for comment.
In October 2022, Russian trade officials said they had established 20 operators at the Tanger Med port to "promptly carry out" the logistics of getting cargo loaded onto "feeder" vessels ultimately bound for Russia, according to a weekly shipping report. Another report noted that ports in Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, had accepted payment in rubles.
"The sanctions restrictions have been successfully overcome," one government report said of a Turkish trade route this March.
Click and Buy
On little-known Russian e-commerce sites like Nag, OCS Distribution, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom, complex technologies made by major American and European telecom manufacturers, such as Cisco, HP, Juniper, Ericsson and Nokia, are listed for sale.
Many of these sites freely sold Western technology for decades, but overhauled their supply chains because of the war. Since then, the platforms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in technology from China, according to trade records.
China and Hong Kong supplied 85 percent of semiconductors imported to Russia from March 2022 to September 2023, up from 27 percent before the conflict, according to the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit that studies Russian trade routes.
Nag, which sells hardware to regional telecoms and surveillance contractors, is one major platform. Through intermediaries, it has bought roughly $ 100 million in restricted American tech since the war began, according to trade data. In total, it imported $ 150 million in hardware from China this year, the data show. Communications gear, which has ostensibly been prohibited from reaching Russia, is readily available on its site, filtered by price, product type and quantity.
Nag employees have talked about logistical challenges that international sanctions have caused, according to internal communications. In May 2022, a Nag employee wrote to a Russian customer that "the old transit system has ended," delaying delivery of $ 20,000 of Juniper equipment. A month later, Nag followed up to say that the problem had been resolved and that the gear would arrive in the coming months.
Tech for building online surveillance and censorship was also available. Russian telecom operators are required by law to provide communications data about customers to the security services, meaning they must buy specialized equipment that sends the information to government agents. On Nag message boards, now accessible only from within Russia, engineers posted technical tips for making the systems work to F.S.B. specs.
Ericsson, Juniper, Nokia and IBM said any imports into Russia were done without their consent. OCS Distribution said that it "does not sell products in violation of international sanctions and restrictions" and that any such tech listed on its website for purchase was there because it was in the midst of an overhaul. HP, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom did not respond to requests for comment.
A network of Nag-operated companies and brands in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates has also helped obscure shipments of sanctioned technology. In total, Nag brought in almost $ 10 million in Cisco equipment and about $ 1 million in Nokia and Intel products to Russia over the past year.
At the F.S.B. offices in Yekaterinburg, the Cisco gear that Convex engineers installed sat alongside routers made by Juniper, according to Convex's records. Less than a year later, the availability of Western tech was so abundant that Convex's engineers could shop around.
In a conversation on Convex's internal messaging system this year, engineers focused on a new supplier that they had "spotted." Operating under the name sale-server.ru, the supplier had plenty of restricted name-brand technology from HP, IBM and others. More important, the price was right.
"Cheaper than Nag," one Convex employee wrote.

IBM Will Acquire Portion
Of Software AG's Business
IBM said on Monday that it would buy the enterprise integration platforms of Software AG, a German company, for $ 2.33 billion to bolster its artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud offerings.
IBM will acquire Software AG's StreamSets and webMethods platforms with cash, it said. The two units formed Software AG's so-called Super Ipaas business, which was created in October.
The platforms provide application integration, application programming interface management, and data integration, among other uses.
The majority of Software AG is owned by the private equity firm Silver Lake, which owns 93.3 percent of shares in the company after a takeover pursuit spanning several months.
That deal valued the whole business at $ 2.84 billion.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. REUTERS

Icahn Makes New Push
For Changes at Illumina
The activist investor Carl Icahn, right, said on Monday that he planned to oust directors at the gene-sequencing company Illumina, laying the groundwork for a second board challenge months after shareholders elected one of his director candidates.
Mr. Icahn disclosed his plans, without offering details, in a letter to other shareholders less than 24 hours after Illumina said it would divest the blood-test maker Grail.
The investor had long been critical of Illumina's $ 7 billion Grail acquisition and made it a centerpiece of his previous proxy fight in which Andrew Teno, a portfolio manager working for Icahn, won a seat on the 11-member board.
In Monday's letter, Icahn blamed the Grail acquisition, which has faced regulatory challenges since 2021, for a 75 percent drop in Illumina's share price that he says wiped away $ 55 billion in value for shareholders. REUTERS

Crude Exports Surging
Out of the Gulf Coast
Oil is flooding out of Texas in the final weeks of 2023, as traders find outlets abroad for record U.S. production and dodge a hefty year-end tax bill on their inventories.
U.S. crude exports, nearly all of which leave from the Gulf Coast, averaged about four million barrels per day so far this year, according to government data, about 500,000 more than last year's record as oil production climbed to 13.2 million barrels per day.
West Texas Intermediate crude's wider discount to the global benchmark Brent, currently about $ 4.50 per barrel, is making U.S. oil more attractive to European and Asian refiners.
Gulf Coast crude inventories fell 1.2 percent to 247.9 million barrels last week, the third straight week of declines, in part because of strong exports. Storage utilization stood at about 63 percent of total working capacity along the coast, lower than average utilization in prior years. REUTERS

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and SUVs have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40% of Hyundai’s electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesperson said, up from just 5% before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit “is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion,” Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $3,750, a Kia spokesperson said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least 7 kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $7,500 credit, a company spokesperson said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $63,000 in November from $68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
“The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices,” Roberts of CarGurus said. “You are going to see more mainstream vehicles.”

E.V. Jobs? China Has Them to Spare.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China misjudged the rapid expansion of its electric vehicle sector, leaving a shortfall of skilled technicians as young people shun manufacturing careers.
Xing Wei graduated from a vocational high school in northeastern China in 2003 and went to work as an electrician in an auto parts factory in the country's south. The only set of wheels he could afford was a black, three-speed bicycle.
He earned $ 1,150 a year and shared a sweltering dormitory room with three other workers. "There was air-conditioning, but because we had to pay the electricity ourselves, we basically didn't turn it on," Mr. Xing said.
Two decades later, Mr. Xing, 42, makes close to $ 60,000 a year. He works as a senior electrician installing industrial robots at electric car factories for Nio, a Chinese automaker. Last winter, he bought a $ 52,000 Nio ES6 sport utility vehicle.
China's electric vehicle market is the world's largest and fastest growing. A frenzy of construction and expansion of factories has made electricians and robotics specialists a hot commodity.
"If you want to recruit people with relevant experience, there are relatively few people in this industry," Mr. Xing said.
More than 1.5 million people now work at dozens of electric vehicle companies in China and their suppliers. The largest of them, BYD, has 570,000 workers, compared with 610,000 worldwide for Detroit's Big Three combined.
As parts of China's economy slow, Beijing needs to shift workers to sectors that are still growing fast, most notably electric vehicle manufacturing. But Beijing faces a shortfall in vocational training, as well as a surplus of young people with university degrees who aren't interested in factory work.
Most in demand are skilled technicians and engineers like Mr. Xing. Assembly line workers at automotive plants earn less than half his salary.
Beijing estimated in 2021 that the country had more than twice as many jobs for skilled technicians as the actual number of qualified workers.
A report issued last year by the Shanghai government found that the highest-paid 10 percent of senior factory technicians earned at least $ 51,000 a year. Workers with these skills change jobs frequently: Before moving to Hefei in central China two years ago to work for Nio, Mr. Xing set up a stamping line in nearby Ningbo for Zeekr, a division of Zhejiang Geely.
Fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities, Chinese automakers are building electric car factories faster than sales are rising, prompting a price war that has left most companies losing money. That has caused a shakeout in the industry. Nio, for example, announced in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees. None of the cuts were in manufacturing, Nio said.
"We are already very concerned about the shortage of hands," said Ji Huaqiang, Nio's vice president of manufacturing.
The seeds of the labor shortage were planted years ago when the Chinese government's economic planners failed to see the scale of the electric car boom and to train enough workers for it.
In 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology predicted that the electric car industry would need 1.2 million workers in 2025, and warned that China had only 170,000 people then with the necessary skills.
To be sure, more than two-fifths of the country's 11 million college graduates each year study topics related to science and engineering. That is double the proportion in the United States, which also has a shortfall of welders, electricians and other industrial workers.
But many of those college graduates aspire to work in white-collar jobs at internet companies and the civil service, not at factories.
For several decades, factories in China could count on a constant flow of farmers' sons and daughters who arrived in cities and would take practically any job, no matter how dull.
One of them was Mr. Xing. He was determined as a teenager to leave his hometown, Hongshi, near China's border with North Korea. He attended a vocational high school, where his teacher said he should look for work in southeastern China, near Hong Kong. As soon as he earned his high school diploma, he packed his bags.
In Guangzhou, he found a job at a factory that stamped out car body parts for a nearby Honda assembly plant. Whenever new equipment arrived, foreign experts connected it to laptops and made all the decisions on test runs. Mr. Xing understood little.
"I could only look at them like a dummy," he said.
It left a mark on him. He lived on free cafeteria meals at the factory and saved his pay, $ 100 a month, to buy a $ 1,195 IBM laptop. He studied automation on weekends through an adult education program.
The training would help set him up for a career in the electric vehicle sector. By 2019, he had bought a nearly 1,100-square-foot condo in an outlying suburb of Ningbo, 800 miles from Guangzhou. Today, his parents are living in the condo while Mr. Xing and his wife and their two sons pay $ 350 a month to rent a 1,300-square-foot apartment in Hefei.
The Chinese government has tried to train a generation of workers like Mr. Xing, with mixed results.
In 2014, Xi Jinping, China's top leader, exhorted government and Communist Party officials, as well as businesses, to "cultivate hundreds of millions of high-quality laborers and technical and skilled personnel."
But that goal has collided with the rising aspirations of Chinese parents who have shown less interest in sending their children to vocational high schools to learn the skills of an electrician, a machinist or another technician.
The number of teenagers entering vocational and technical high schools plummeted 25 percent between 2010 and 2021, the year with the most recent data. At the same time, the number of students attending academic high schools barely changed.
"Factory jobs are often associated with the 'three D's' -- dirty, dangerous and demeaning," said Minhua Ling, an associate professor specializing in China's vocational education system at the Geneva Graduate Institute. Younger Chinese "find it demeaning," she said. "Feeling like a machine is not meaningful to them."
About 60 percent of the Chinese population turning 18 enroll at a university. In 2000, it was 10 percent.
Companies in China have been slower than those in some countries, like Germany, to set up long-term apprentice programs to train future factory floor leaders.
"The demand rose so quickly that the education system was caught flat-footed, and it takes a few years to adequately prepare and train top-notch technicians," said Gerard A. Postiglione, an emeritus professor of higher education research at the University of Hong Kong.
A steepening decline in birthrates adds to the urgency of the challenge.
The number of young people turning 18 each year in China has dropped by more than 40 percent since the mid-1980s. Based on the number of babies born in the past few years, the number of 18-year-olds will halve in the coming years.
China, and particularly the electric car industry, is trying to use automation to address its shortage of willing hands.
According to the International Federation of Robotics, businesses in China installed more industrial robots in 2022 than the rest of the world combined. It exceeded its biggest manufacturing rivals, Japan, the United States, South Korea and Germany.
By 2027, Nio plans to replace half its managerial positions with artificial intelligence and a third of its factory workers with robots, said Mr. Ji, the company's vice president of manufacturing. One of Nio's factories makes 300,000 E.V. motors a year and has a mere 30 workers.
"All of these companies have a hard time to find blue-collar labor," said Zhou Linlin, the chief executive of Principle Capital, a Shanghai investment firm with stakes in numerous Chinese factories. "That's why all the companies are looking for automation and robotics solutions."
But robots can make up for only some of China's growing demand for factory technicians.
Volkswagen is hiring for a new research center near Nio, in Hefei, that will staff 3,000 engineers to develop electric cars, and it is preparing to build electric cars there.
That means even more demand for specialists like Mr. Xing, who already has trouble filling his own team of electricians. "We are also constantly recruiting," he said, "and we are not able to recruit suitable, relevant personnel."

Tesla Recalling 2 Million Cars Over Autopilot: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Federal regulators pressed the automaker to make updates to ensure drivers are paying attention while using Autopilot, a system that can steer, accelerate and brake on its own.
Tesla's reputation for making technologically advanced cars suffered a blow on Tuesday when the company, under pressure from regulators, recalled more than two million vehicles. U.S. officials said the automaker had not done enough to ensure that drivers remained attentive when using a system that can steer, accelerate and brake cars automatically.
The recall by Tesla, the world's dominant maker of electric vehicles, was its fourth in less than two years and the most significant to date. It covers nearly all cars the company has manufactured in the United States since 2012, including its most popular, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle.
Tesla accounts for about half of the electric passenger cars sold in the United States, but its market share has been slipping as General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and other automakers have begun selling electric models. In addition, recent public statements by Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, have been widely interpreted as antisemitic and offended some customers. The recall amounts to another dent in the company's image.
"There's no question" that the company's brand "has taken a hit this year," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, who is generally positive about Tesla, said on the social media site X, which is owned by Mr. Musk.
The recall follows an investigation into Tesla's driver-assistance system, Autopilot, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began in August 2021 after a series of accidents, some fatal, involving the technology. Autopilot is designed to control vehicles on its own when on highways. Tesla's owners manuals tell drivers that they should keep their hands on the wheel and take over if anything goes wrong.
The recall reflects regulators' concern that Tesla did not do enough to prevent drivers from misusing the system, including by turning it on while they travel local roads and by becoming distracted because they assumed that their car could drive itself.
What Tesla calls Autopilot is a collection of features allowing the car's technology to take over a vehicle's control to varying degrees. The feature singled out in the recall, Autosteer, can keep a car in a lane without driver intervention.
There may be "increased risk of a crash," the safety administration said, when Autosteer is engaged and drivers do not "maintain responsibility for vehicle operation."
To address that problem, Tesla said it would wirelessly update its cars to add new, more prominent visual alerts and checks when Autosteer is engaged to remind drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla said it did not agree with agency's assessment of the system. The company has maintained that Autopilot makes its cars safer.
Manufacturers are responsible for preventing foreseeable misuse of their technology, the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the auto safety agency, said during a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times on Wednesday.
"They're going to say that it's safer with these systems," Mr. Buttigieg said, referring to Tesla. "That could be true. But you know, a car with an airbag is safer than a car without an airbag. If the airbag blows up, we're still going to recall it."
On Monday, Tesla said on the X platform, "It is morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers, given the incontrovertible data that shows it is saving lives and preventing injury," a response to an article in The Washington Post about the technology's flaws.
Some experts question whether Autopilot makes driving safer. Philip Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies self-driving software, said that improvements in safety come almost entirely from one feature, automatic emergency braking, which is commonplace on all new vehicles.
"Autopilot is not a safety feature, it's a convenience feature," Mr. Koopman said.
The regulator said its investigation would continue.
The recall was "egregiously overdue," two Democratic senators -- Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut -- said in a statement. "We urge N.H.T.S.A. to continue its investigations to spur necessary recalls, and Tesla to stop misleading drivers and putting the public in great danger."
The investigation is the most prominent example of a wider push and pull among government regulators and companies developing technologies that allow vehicles to drive on their own in certain situations.
In October, California regulators ordered Cruise, a G.M. subsidiary, to stop its driverless taxi service in San Francisco after a series of traffic mishaps, including one in which a Cruise car dragged a pedestrian 20 feet after a crash. The company has since suspended its driverless car operations across the country.
Mr. Buttigieg said that some companies have pushed out self-driving technology before it was proved to be safe for broad use. These companies, he said, were motivated in part by the large number of highway accidents and deaths. More than 30,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in the first nine months of this year, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier but about 6,000 more than in the same period in 2013.
"I think the culture in a lot of these companies is around getting to that promised land, where the faster we build this technology and the sooner we get it out there, the better off everybody will be because human drivers have a murderous track record," he said.
The auto safety agency said that in August 2021 it began investigating 11 incidents involving Tesla vehicles that were operating with Autosteer engaged. A series of meetings between the agency and Tesla followed, and the company decided this month to voluntarily administer a recall.
Over the course of its investigation, the safety agency said, it has reviewed 956 crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. Then it focused on 322 crashes, including frontal collisions and situations where Autopilot may have been accidentally engaged.
Tesla began issuing wireless software updates to certain vehicles this week, safety officials said. The remaining vehicles will receive updates later. Tesla has for years updated the software in its cars using cellular networks, usually overnight when cars are parked.
Depending on the hardware on a car, some updated vehicles will feature more prominent visual alerts as well as additional checks when using Autosteer. The feature will also be suspended if drivers repeatedly fail to use it responsibly.
Letters to Tesla owners notifying them of the update are expected to be mailed in February.
Tesla's recall this week is the latest episode to heighten public scrutiny of the automaker. In October, a California jury found that the company's driver-assistance software was not at fault in a crash that killed a Tesla owner and seriously injured two passengers.
Several similar cases are being litigated around the country. One involves a 2019 crash in Florida in which a Tesla operating on Autopilot on a country road ran through a stop sign and hit a parked car, killing Naibel Benavides, 22, and severely injuring her companion.
Todd Poses, a lawyer representing the family of Ms. Benavides, said the recall showed Tesla was aware Autopilot was being used on roads where it wasn't safe, and failed to restrict where it could be turned on.
"This accident never should have happened because it doesn't work on roads like this," Mr. Poses said on Wednesday, referring to Autopilot.
The driver of the Tesla had dropped his phone and bent down to look for it, trusting Autopilot to steer his Tesla Model S. But the car failed to stop at a T-intersection with a flashing red light.
"This technology is not safe, it needs to be off the roads," said Dillon Angulo, who was with Ms. Benavides and suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken pelvis and a broken jaw.
Tesla has faced several other recalls. In May, China ordered Tesla to recall 1.1 million vehicles, citing an issue with the acceleration and braking systems of certain models manufactured in China and abroad.
A few months earlier, Tesla recalled more than 362,000 cars equipped with its Full Self Driving driver-assistance system, a more advanced technology than Autopilot, after U.S. regulators found it increased the risk of accidents.
The more advanced system allows vehicles to travel above legal speed limits and through intersections in "an unlawful and unpredictable manner," safety officials said.
And in early 2022, Tesla recalled 54,000 cars equipped with its Full Self Driving software to disable a feature that in certain conditions let the vehicles roll slowly through intersections without making required stops.
Tesla sells Full Self Driving separately from Autopilot. But the two services are underpinned by the same technologies. In the past, drivers who have not purchased the more advanced system have been able to use Autopilot on roads that are not highways.
The company's latest recall explains that drivers will be alerted when they are using Autopilot outside of roadways where the technology is intended to operate. But it is unclear whether they will still be permitted to use the technology in these situations.
"N.H.T.S.A. has forced Tesla to focus on the right issues," said Matthew Wansley, professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. "But everything depends on the details."

In October, California regulators ordered Cruise, a GM subsidiary, to stop its driverless taxi service in San Francisco after a series of traffic mishaps, including one in which a Cruise car dragged a pedestrian 20 feet after a crash. The company has since suspended its driverless car operations across the country.
Buttigieg said that some companies have pushed out self-driving technology before it was proved to be safe for broad use. These companies, he said, were motivated in part by the large number of highway accidents and deaths. More than 30,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in the first nine months of this year, down 4.5% from a year earlier but about 6,000 more than in the same period in 2013.
“I think the culture in a lot of these companies is around getting to that promised land, where the faster we build this technology and the sooner we get it out there, the better off everybody will be because human drivers have a murderous track record,” he said.
The auto safety agency said that in August 2021 it began investigating 11 incidents involving Tesla vehicles that were operating with Autosteer engaged. A series of meetings between the agency and Tesla followed, and the company decided this month to voluntarily administer a recall.
Over the course of its investigation, the safety agency said, it has reviewed 956 crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. Then it focused on 322 crashes, including frontal collisions and situations in which Autopilot may have been accidentally engaged.
Tesla began issuing wireless software updates to certain vehicles this week, safety officials said. The remaining vehicles will receive updates later. Tesla has for years updated the software in its cars using cellular networks, usually overnight when cars are parked.
Depending on the hardware on a car, some updated vehicles will feature more prominent visual alerts as well as additional checks when using Autosteer. The feature will also be suspended if drivers repeatedly fail to use it responsibly.
Letters to Tesla owners notifying them of the update are expected to be mailed in February.
Tesla’s recall this week is the latest episode to heighten public scrutiny of the automaker. In October, a California jury found that the company’s driver-assistance software was not at fault in a crash that killed a Tesla owner and seriously injured two passengers.
Several similar cases are being litigated around the country. One involves a 2019 crash in Florida in which a Tesla operating on Autopilot on a country road ran through a stop sign and hit a parked car, killing Naibel Benavides, 22, and severely injuring her companion.
Todd Poses, a lawyer representing the family of Benavides, said the recall showed Tesla was aware Autopilot was being used on roads where it wasn’t safe and failed to restrict where it could be turned on.
“This accident never should have happened because it doesn’t work on roads like this,” Poses said Wednesday, referring to Autopilot.
The driver of the Tesla had dropped his phone and bent down to look for it, trusting Autopilot to steer his Tesla Model S. But the car failed to stop at a T-intersection with a flashing red light.
“This technology is not safe; it needs to be off the roads,” said Dillon Angulo, who was with Benavides and suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken pelvis and a broken jaw.
Tesla has faced several other recalls. In May, China ordered Tesla to recall 1.1 million vehicles, citing an issue with the acceleration and braking systems of certain models manufactured in China and abroad.
A few months earlier, Tesla recalled more than 362,000 cars equipped with its Full Self Driving driver-assistance system, a more advanced technology than Autopilot, after U.S. regulators found it increased the risk of accidents.
The more advanced system allows vehicles to travel above legal speed limits and through intersections in “an unlawful and unpredictable manner,” safety officials said.
And in early 2022, Tesla recalled 54,000 cars equipped with its Full Self Driving software to disable a feature that in certain conditions let the vehicles roll slowly through intersections without making required stops.
Tesla sells Full Self Driving separately from Autopilot. But the two services are underpinned by the same technologies. In the past, drivers who have not purchased the more advanced system have been able to use Autopilot on roads that are not highways.
The company’s latest recall explains that drivers will be alerted when they are using Autopilot outside of roadways where the technology is intended to operate. But it is unclear whether they will still be permitted to use the technology in these situations.
“NHTSA has forced Tesla to focus on the right issues,” said Matthew Wansley, professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. “But everything depends on the details.”

New York Will Invest in Chip Research: [Correction]

Full text: The move is aimed at drawing $ 9 billion in corporate investment, as New York jockeys to host a new national semiconductor technology center.
Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced on Monday a plan to invest $ 1 billion to expand chip research activities in Albany, N.Y., as the state aims to continue as a global semiconductor center.
The plan is expected to create 700 new permanent jobs and retain thousands more, and includes the purchase of a new version of one of the world's most expensive and sophisticated manufacturing machines, along with the construction of a new building to house it.
At an event in Albany, Gov. Hochul positioned the investment as a national priority. "The Chinese are attempting to dominate this industry," she said. "We have no intention of letting that happen. "
The initiative should draw $ 9 billion in additional investments from chip-related companies, according to state officials. They expect it to boost New York's chances to be selected to host a new National Semiconductor Technology Center, a planned centerpiece of the research portion of federal money that Congress allocated in 2022 as part of the CHIPS Act.
"We're hoping that this level of investment will attract more investment from the U.S. CHIPS Act to make it even bigger," said Mukesh Khare, an IBM vice president who is general manager of its semiconductor operations.
Besides IBM, which has long conducted chip research in Albany, companies participating in the project include Micron Technology, Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron.
The focus of the effort is the Albany Nanotech Complex, a cluster of research buildings owned and operated by a state-affiliated nonprofit called NY CREATES. The state plans to spend about $ 500 million to build a new 50,000-square-foot clean room building.
A different building is needed to accommodate the next major advance in a technology called lithography, which projects patterns of circuitry on silicon wafers to make chips. Advances in such equipment are needed to create smaller transistors and other circuitry to boost the power of computers and other devices.
The most sophisticated chips are currently made using technology called extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography. The Dutch company ASML is the dominant supplier of the machines, which officials in the United States and the Netherlands have prevented from being sold to China as part of an effort to limit that country's progress in chip manufacturing.
Albany Nanotech has owned prototype EUV tools and currently operates a commercial version. Under the new plan, New York will invest $ 500 million to purchase a next-generation EUV system -- known by the phrase "High NA," for numerical aperture -- that will allow the center to develop much more advanced chips.
Besides permanent research jobs, state officials estimated that the Albany project would generate 500 to 600 temporary construction jobs over roughly two years.
Albany NanoTech won't be the first to use the High NA tool. Intel has ordered the first system from ASML, which is expected to begin installing it in early 2024. The comparable machine is expected to arrive in Albany in late 2025, Mr. Khare said.
The effort is unusual in several ways, including that the new machine will be owned by the state and operated as a public resource to help the broader U.S. semiconductor industry, he added.
States in the Northeast United States seem destined to play a big role in the chip industry's evolution. U.S. Commerce Department officials also said Monday that BAE Systems in New Hampshire will receive the first grant under the manufacturing portion of the CHIPS Act.
Micron, a Boise, Idaho, company that is the only American maker of chips used to store data, has also said it will spend up to $ 100 billion over a decade or more to develop a new manufacturing site near Syracuse, N.Y.

U.A.W. Says 3 Carmakers Violated Labor Laws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

Finding the Balance in Regulating A.I.: [SpecialSections]

Full text: Participants in a task force on artificial intelligence at the DealBook Summit grappled with how to balance oversight of the technology with innovation.
This article is part of our special section on the DealBook Summit that included business and policy leaders from around the world.
Takeaways
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, signals a radical change in how A.I. will be used in every area of society, but it still must be viewed as a tool that humans can use and control -- not as something that controls us.
Some sort of regulation of AI is needed, but opinions vary widely on the breadth and enforceability of such rules.
For the potential of A.I. to be realized and the risks, as much as possible, to be controlled, technology companies cannot go it alone. There should be genuine partnerships with other sectors, such as universities and government.
Get seven artificial intelligence experts together in one room and there's a lot of debate about just about everything -- from legislation to transparency to best practices. But they could agree on at least one thing.
It's not supernatural.
"A.I. is not something that comes from Mars. It's something that we shape," said Francesca Rossi, an IBM fellow and IBM A.I. Ethics Global Leader. Ms. Rossi, along with other representatives of industry, academia and the European Union Parliament, participated in last week's DealBook Summit task force on how to harness the potential of A.I. while regulating its risks.
Acknowledging that A.I. did not emerge from outer space was the easy part. But how it will be shaped -- not just in the United States but globally -- was far more difficult. What role should governments play in controlling A.I.? How transparent should technology companies be about their A.I. research? Should A.I. adoption go more slowly in some fields even if the capability exists?
While A.I. has been around for decades, when the company OpenAI released ChatGPT a year ago it immediately became a worldwide phenomenon; Kevin Roose, a technology writer for The New York Times and moderator of the task force, wrote, "ChatGPT is, quite simply, the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public."
These new types of chatbots can communicate in an eerily humanlike manner and in countless languages. And all are in their infancy. While ChatGPT is the best known, there are others, including Google's Bard and most recently, Amazon's Q.
"We all know that this particular phase of A.I. is at the very, very early stages," said John Roese, president and chief technology officer of Dell Technologies. No one can be complacent or think of A.I. "just as a commodity."
"It is not," he said. "This is not something you just consume. This is something you navigate."
While A.I. has taken a giant leap forward -- and is evolving so rapidly that it is hard to keep up with the state of play -- it is important not to mystify it, said Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford University and co-director at the university's Human-Centered A.I. Institute. "Somehow we're too hyped up by this. It's a tool. Human civilization starts with tool using and tool invention from fire to stone, to steam to electricity. They get more and more complex, but it's still a tool-to-human relationship."
While it's true that some ways in which A.I. works are inexplicable even to its developers, Professor Li noted that is also true about things like pharmaceuticals -- acetaminophen, for example. She said, however, that part of the reason most people don't hesitate to take the drugs is because there's a federal agency -- the Food and Drug Administration -- that regulates medications.
That raises the question of whether there should be the equivalent of the F.D.A. for A.I.?
Some regulation is needed, participants agreed, but the trick is deciding what that should look like.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who was interviewed at the DealBook conference, spoke separately on the issue.
"I know that there is a balance that can and must be struck between what we must do in terms of oversight and regulation, and being intentional to not stifle innovation," she said.
It's finding the balance that is tough, however.
The European Parliament is hammering out the first major law to regulate artificial intelligence, something the rest of the world is watching closely.
Part of the law calls for assessments of A.I. used in identified high-risk areas, such as health care, education and criminal justice. That would require makers of A.I. systems to disclose, among other things, what data is being used to train its systems -- to avoid biases and other issues -- and how they are managing sensitive information and its environmental impact. It also would severely limit the use of facial recognition software.
Brando Benifei, a member of the European Parliament and task force participant, said he hopes it will be passed early next year; there will be a grace period before it is implemented.
In October, the White House issued a lengthy executive order on A.I., but without an enforcement mechanism, something Mr. Benifei sees as necessary. "Obviously, it's a delicate topic," he said. "There is a lot of concern from the business sector, I think rightly so, that we do not overregulate before we fully understand all the challenges." But, he said, "we cannot just rely on self-regulation." The development and use of A.I., he added, must be "enforceable and explainable to our citizens."
Other task force members were far more reluctant to embrace such broad regulation. Questions abound, such as who is responsible if something goes wrong -- the original developer? A third-party vendor? The end user?
"You cannot regulate A.I. in a vacuum," Mr. Roese said. "A.I. has a dependency on the software ecosystem, on the data ecosystem. If you try to regulate A.I. without contemplating the upstream and downstream effects on the adjacent industries, you'll get it wrong."
For that reason, he said, it makes more sense to have an A.I. office or department within the relevant government agencies -- perhaps with an overarching A.I. coordinator -- rather than try to create a centralized A.I. agency.
Transparency is key, all agreed, and so are partnerships between government, industry and university research. "If you are not very transparent, then academia gets left behind and no researchers will come out of academia," said Rohit Prasad, senior vice president and head scientist at Amazon Artificial General Intelligence.
Professor Li, the lone academic representative in the room, noted that companies often say they want partnerships but don't "walk the walk."
In addition, she said, "It's not just about regulation. It really has to do with investment in the public sector in a deep and profound way," noting that she has directly pleaded with Congress and President Biden to support universities in this area. Academia, she said, can serve as a trusted neutral platform in this field, but "right now we have completely starved the public sector."
A.I. has been called an existential threat to humanity -- potentially through its use in surveillance that undermines democracy or in launching automated weapons that could kill on a massive scale. But such highly publicized warnings distract from more mundane but more immediate problems of A.I., said Mr. Benifei.
"We have today problems of algorithmic biases, of misuse of A.I., that is in the daily life of people, not about the catastrophe for humanity," he said.
All of these issues concern Lila Ibrahim, chief operating officer of Google DeepMind. But a major one, she noted, they hadn't had time to touch on: "How do we actually equip youth today with A.I. skills and do it with diversity and inclusion?" she asked. "How do we not leave people further behind?"

Charlie Munger's Investing Legacy: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The investor Charlie Munger, who died last week at age 99, liked the word "lollapalooza." The word appears 27 times in the new abridged edition of "Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger."
I think Munger's fondness for that fanciful term -- which he meant as either a big gain or a big loss -- reveals a lot about his investing philosophy and that of his longtime partner, Warren Buffett. It's worth pondering what he meant, even though the style of investing he did isn't suitable for most of us.
Lollapalooza effects "can make you rich, or they can kill you," Munger wrote in his Benjamin Franklin-style "almanack." As I understand it, his advice is to minimize the risk of bad lollapaloozas because they destroy so much value that even good lollapaloozas won't be enough to dig you out of the hole you're in. Math is unforgiving that way: If you go down 80 percent and then up 80 percent, you will still be down 64 percent.
I had arranged with Munger's book publicists to interview him a day or two after Christmas. I'm sorry to have missed that opportunity. Still, the book speaks for itself. It combines his own writings and speeches with observations about him from others.
There's an impression that Buffett and Munger got rich by being good at picking stocks and entire companies to buy for Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha-headquartered holding company of which Buffett is chairman and chief executive and Munger was vice chairman. They made their share of mistakes, though. In 2017, for example, Buffett and Munger told shareholders they had erred by loading up on IBM shares and giving Amazon, Google and Walmart a pass. Buying shares in USAir in 1989 was another famous misstep.
I think the real secret to their success -- and it's not really a secret, since they talked about it all the time -- is everything else they did aside from their initial choices of what to buy. That includes, for companies that Berkshire Hathaway owns outright, choosing chief executives carefully and then leaving them alone.
But let's focus on the lollapaloozas. Munger talked about "combinatorial effects" in which a variety of psychological forces, each mild enough in its own right, come together and reinforce one another to create good or bad lollapaloozas. The original success of Coca-Cola came from positive combinatorial effects, with the qualities of the product and the relentlessness of the advertising working together to habituate customers, he wrote. Conversely, he added, the ill-fated introduction of New Coke in 1985 suffered from a combination of several mistakes.
To get the good lollapaloozas and not the bad ones requires two things, from what I can glean from Munger's book and Berkshire Hathaway's famous annual shareholder letters. One is patience to wait for good opportunities, and the other is plentiful available cash when those opportunities finally present themselves.
Wise investors "bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity" and sit on their hands the rest of the time, Munger said in the book. "But a huge majority of people have some other crazy construct in their heads. And instead of waiting for a near cinch and loading up, they apparently ascribe to the theory that if they work a little harder or hire more business school students, they'll come to know everything about everything all the time. To me, that's totally insane." A few good calls is all anyone needs or should expect in a lifetime, he argued.
As for the second part of the formula, plentiful cash, that's what makes it possible for Berkshire Hathaway to be "greedy when others are fearful," in Buffett's famous formulation. At the end of the third quarter this year, Berkshire Hathaway had $ 157 billion in cash, cash equivalents and Treasury bills. Those are low-yielding assets that most investors would consider an unacceptable drag on their performance, but they give Berkshire Hathaway the ability to pounce immediately on a promising investment.
Buffett and Munger discovered early that well-run insurance companies generate a lot of cash in the form of "float" -- money that's received in premiums and hasn't been paid out yet in claims. They realized that while some of the float has to be kept in cash to meet immediate obligations to policyholders, some could also be deployed in higher-yielding investments. And that's what they did.
I'll pause here to say that what works for Berkshire Hathaway does not work for the average investor with a long-term perspective. If you lack the resources of Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger you're probably better off keeping your money in broad-market index funds, riding the market up and down, and staying fully invested in stocks and bonds rather than trying to time the market by holding cash in reserve.
That said, I think the life lesson of protecting yourself from huge losses so you can stay in the game applies to everyone. Early last month I told Mark Spitznagel, the founder and chief investment officer of Universa Investments, that I was due to interview Munger. His eyes lit up. He is a huge admirer of Munger and Buffett.
This says something because Berkshire Hathaway is old school in a lot of ways. It owns Geico and BNSF Railway, among other large companies, and has big stakes in the likes of Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola and Chevron. Universa, meanwhile, is a Miami-based investment management firm with an edgy strategy of "tail risk hedging," which produces blockbuster results when markets fall sharply. (I wrote about Spitznagel two years ago.)
Spitznagel said that Berkshire Hathaway's cash pile serves the same function for that company as Universa's strategy of using financial instruments to insure portfolios against losses: It turns crashes into opportunities. "They have dry powder when they need it and when it is most valuable, when the market is down," he said.
This gets back to lollapaloozas. Let's say there's a strategy that has a 60 percent chance of giving you a huge win and a 40 percent chance of losing badly. If you could play that game 100 times and average your winnings, you'd do great (especially when that dry powder allows you to buy during the fire sales 40 percent of the time). But you have only one shot, so you should pass on the opportunity. Focus instead on building wealth over the long term by minimizing those bad lollapaloozas to "protect your capital base from which you compound each period," as Mark Spitznagel says. And reinvest your gains. Eliminating really big losses gives compounding -- i.e., reinvestment of gains -- a chance to work its magic.
"Poor Charlie's Almanack" cites Munger as having said, "'Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world' (Einstein); never interrupt it unnecessarily." There's no evidence that Einstein actually said the part about the eighth wonder, but Munger definitely did say the part about not interrupting it unnecessarily. I wish I'd been able to ask him about it.
Elsewhere: Fewer Job Openings
The rate of job openings fell in October to its lowest level since February 2021, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on Tuesday. That's a sign the labor market is cooling off. The rate of layoffs and discharges remains low (1 percent in October), but when people do lose a job, it's harder to find another. That's apparent in claims for unemployment insurance. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose only 2 percent over the 12 months through Nov. 25, but continued claims (by people who remain out of work) rose 24 percent in the 12 months through Nov. 18, according to the Employment and Training Administration.
Quote of the Day
"Just as economies can reap economic gains by specializing in what they are relatively good at, the world can reap environmental gains if economies specialize in activities that they are relatively green at."
-- Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director general of the World Trade Organization, foreword to "Trade Policy Tools for Climate Action" (Dec. 2, 2023)

Full text: Industry leaders at the conference were asked about what's next for artificial intelligence, the economy, health care and more.
This article is part of our special section on the DealBook Summit that included business and policy leaders from around the world.
For last week's DealBook Summit in New York City, The New York Times invited leaders in an array of disciplines to gather together to talk about some of the most pressing challenges they see in their areas of expertise. The Times asked them similar questions in advance. Their answers have been edited and condensed.
Artificial Intelligence
On balance, do you believe humanity would be better off with or without A.I.? How do you navigate any doubt?
Rohit Prasad: Senior vice president and head scientist, artificial general intelligence, Amazon
Humanity always benefits from technological leaps forward and A.I. will be no different. Every day, different teams across Amazon are thinking about how to innovate with A.I. responsibly on behalf of our customers. Responsible deployment of rapidly improving A.I. for human interest and safety is paramount to get this right.
Michael Abramowitz: President, Freedom House
Advances in A.I. are supercharging censorship, surveillance and disinformation -- but that doesn't have to be the case. When designed and deployed safely and fairly, A.I. can help streamline democratic processes and support democracy's defenders. We must ensure A.I. is a tool for democracy, not a weapon against it.
Annie Dorsen: Playwright
Tech companies present A.I. as a boon to innovation, but the reality is quite the opposite. Because A.I. works with statistical prediction, its outputs inevitably revert to mediocrity. When we outsource our thinking and imaginations to A.I., we are left with an impoverished culture: We lose out on the idiosyncratic, the unpredictable, the never-before-seen.
If you could turn the clock back (or forward) on A.I., would you? If so, where would you go?
Brando Benifei: Member, European Parliament
I would want to go forward in time to see if we will manage to develop a significant amount of international law and agreements around A.I.: As the technology advances, the risk of dangerous and even uncontrollable weaponization exists, and this cannot be tackled without global cooperation.
Lila Ibrahim: Chief operating officer, Google DeepMind
I'd go forward, to see how A.I. is helping tackle some of society's most fundamental unsolved challenges, like disease and climate change. A.I. is an incredibly powerful tool that's helping humanity unlock our understanding of the way the world works, to achieve breakthroughs that today we can only dream of.
Francesca Rossi: Fellow and A.I. ethics global leader, IBM; president, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
I would not turn the clock back or forward on A.I. because I believe our current time and reality is the most important to learn from A.I. and continue advancing it responsibly. We should all focus today on ensuring this technology continues to serve everyone safely and equally.
John Roese: President and global chief technology officer, Dell Technologies
I would turn time back a few years to reshape the data management ecosystem to focus on enabling GenAI [generative A.I., which includes chatbots such as ChatGPT] as the North Star. GenAI requires data that is organized and accessible to A.I. systems. That would have created focus and mobilized enterprises to move faster, with clarity today.
The Creator Economy
Do creators, brands or consumers hold the greatest power in the creator economy? Why?
Myisha Moore: Vice president, influencer marketing, Edelman
Creators are an authentic voice directly connected to consumers, which the brands want access to. Consumers determine the trends and the top products. Meanwhile, brands aim to seamlessly integrate into the chat without being overbearing or unnatural. Hence, they need the creator, which puts them at the top of the funnel.
Stephen J. Dubner: Co-author of "Freakonomics"; host, "Freakonomics Radio"
All of the above are winners, but I'd say brands (or, often, platforms) easily have the most power. Consumers get choice and value, but are subject to manipulation. Creators get access to an audience, but are easily co-opted. Brands and platforms write the rules, and if things go sideways, they get to rewrite them.
Eva Serrano: Global brand president, Calvin Klein
In the creator economy, each -- creators, brands and consumers -- yields influential power. Creators drive trends and engagement, brands wield resources and marketing prowess, while consumers steer demand and market shifts. Their interplay and mutual reliance define the ecosystem's strength.
Sima Gandhi: Co-founder and chief executive, Creative Juice
Creators are disrupting the traditional commerce model by bypassing brand and advertiser conduits to get straight to consumers. However, creators still rely on brand spend to earn a living -- advertising dollars make up about 80 percent of the creator economy. That means brands still hold power. As creators shift reliance on brand advertising to direct consumer dollars, the balance of power will also shift.
Dara Treseder: Chief marketing officer, Autodesk
While strong partnerships between creators and brands can guide the creator economy, it's ultimately consumers who hold the greatest power. Their dollars define the outcomes for businesses and for the creators who partner with them. Any brand or creator that ignores or misjudges their audience will ultimately pay the price.
Marc D'Amelio: Co-founder and chief executive, D'Amelio Brands
Ultimately, consumers have the greatest power. Brands and creators have to do the work to best control their own destiny, but ultimately it's the consumer that decides to support the brand, follow the creator or purchase the product.
The U.S. Economy
If you could change one thing about how the economy works, what would it be?
Glenn Hubbard: Professor, economics and finance, Columbia Business School
We need renewed emphasis on opportunity and economic participation for more Americans. With it can come mass flourishing. Without it comes greater social unrest and political dysfunction, threatening prosperity and democracy. Ingredients include support for work preparation and work's wages, thoughtful consideration of technology's effects on work's future, realigning government budget priorities.
Isabella Weber: Associate professor, economics, University of Massachusetts Amherst
We need a new economic stabilization paradigm for our age of overlapping emergencies. More shocks are likely to come. It is neither feasible nor desirable to react to sectoral disruptions by macroeconomic tightening. Instead, we need disaster preparedness for systemically important areas like energy and food to increase economic resilience.
Bethany McLean: Contributing editor, Vanity Fair; co-author of "The Big Fail"
Free markets demand morality. Because markets move faster than laws, laws can only do so much. There are some things, such as the sale of destructive subprime mortgages or the looting of hospitals and nursing homes by private equity, to which society needs to say no.
Joe Nocera: Columnist, The Free Press; Co-author of "The Big Fail"
Nothing has damaged the economy more than the phrase "maximizing shareholder value." It has given us scandals (Valeant) and disasters (Boeing 737 Max); exacerbated income inequality and caused too many C.E.O.s to obsess about their paycheck. We would be far better served if companies cared less about shareholders and more about customers and employees.
Martin Whittaker: Founding chief executive, JUST Capital
We need more people to believe American capitalism is working for them, not against them. With politics bereft of long-term vision and serving only to divide, the private sector must lead. An economy in which companies compete by creating value for all their stakeholders is a powerful uniting force.
Entrepreneurship
What's the hardest thing about working with entrepreneurs? What's the most rewarding?
Rebecca Lynn: Co-founder and general partner, Canvas Ventures
[The hardest thing is] teaching them to say "no" to things. Sometimes founders have to hear "no" more as "not now." They have a huge vision and they want to do it all -- immediately. But the fastest way to kill a company is to do everything all at once. You have to walk before you can run. We are along for the whole ride, and we see the struggles and failures. So, when you see someone start from nothing and then make it big, it's huge. You see all their hard work pay off and their family's life change for the better. There's nothing more rewarding.
Pegah Ebrahimi: Co-founder and managing partner, FPV Ventures
Getting to work with founders who have 100-year plans is incredibly rewarding, and our expertise lies in helping others understand their genius when it's too early to grasp. When they succeed it's like watching your kids grow up -- it's quite the journey.
As an entrepreneur, how do you handle fear of failure?
Dylan Field: Co-founder and chief executive, Figma
I learned early on in my career to not look at things in finite terms like "failure" or "success." It's far more productive, I've found, to approach things like products and companies as works in progress. It lowers the stakes and reframes setbacks as opportunities to learn and get better.
Kwame Onwuachi: Chef and owner, Tatiana
I handle the fear of failure at this stage by using fear as fuel. I actually have a tattoo based on that; literally, "fear is fuel" in an artistic expression! Fear is a natural emotion, and courage stands for pushing forward through something that is fearful, scary or intimidating. At this point in my career, if something isn't scary, it's not worth doing.
Health
What's the biggest challenge in public health, and how would you tackle it?
Tom Oxley: Founder and chief executive, Synchron
Providing equitable access to transformative innovations like brain computer interface technology. These advancements offer hope for millions of patients with severe paralysis who can't communicate. The development of a simple, scalable device remains pivotal. Bridging this gap requires cross-industry collaboration, ethical considerations and clear regulatory frameworks sensitive to patients' needs.
Newsha Ghaeli: Co-founder and president, Biobot Analytics
The biggest challenge is a lack of consistent government support and investment, especially during "peacetime" when there is no immediate crisis. To be better prepared for the next pandemic, governments around the world should treat public health with the same urgency and importance as national security.
Karen Nelson: Chief scientific officer, Thermo Fisher Scientific
There are several big challenges on a global scale including cancer, Alzheimer's and chronic disease. The lack of health equity is a critical issue that compounds these other challenges. To address this, leveraging new, advanced and emerging technologies; fostering awareness; and increasing diverse representation in clinical studies is imperative. Diverse population involvement will unlock valuable insights for the development of more effective treatments and equitable health solutions.
Kris Brown: President, Brady
Gun violence is now the leading cause of death for children in the United States, and eight children a day die from unsecured firearms. By changing America's culture around guns, we can turn the tide on this uniquely American epidemic.
Eriona Hysolli: Head of biological sciences, Colossal Biosciences
The highest mortality rates come from diseases acquired as people age. There is an accumulation of somatic mutations and dysregulation of epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation in aged cells and tissues. Deploying genome editing tools that precisely edit both somatic mutations that modulate DNA methylation in a multiplexible fashion could potentially aid aged cells and tissues to regain vitality. These technologies that are currently being used to target monogenic diseases can in the future be leveraged to prevent or delay age-associated diseases.
Labor
As a worker, what is the single most important thing you expect from an employer? What do you offer in return?
Will Coleman: Co-founder and chief executive, Alto
I am not a "worker" but an "owner." Ownership means I am incentivized to create value and am accountable to results. My team at Alto are owners, too, and should expect that we win together and fail together. No one is ever punished for failing as long as actions have positive intent.
Porter Braswell: Founder and chief executive, 2045 Studio
My formative professional experiences made me realize how important it is for employers to foster a sense of belonging to encourage upward mobility and retention, especially for employees of color.
Erica Smiley: Executive director, Jobs With Justice; co-author, "The Future We Need"
I expect employers to provide safe environments, where worker insights are valued as essential contributions. With mechanisms to genuinely listen to worker voices, this is how management truly works alongside workers -- fostering not only a greater, more productive workplace, but a society that values everyone's dignity, rights and contributions.
News and the Election
As another highly charged election approaches, what is your strategy for remaining objective -- is that even a goal?
Ben Smith: Co-founder and editor in chief, Semafor
To not get too caught up in grand theories about the media's world-historic role, and cover the story accurately and to include multiple perspectives.
Lesley Stahl: Correspondent, CBS News
Having a "strategy for remaining objective" implies I can't rely on a natural inclination to be fair after all these years of practice. But there is a new treachery: that (in our politics) we can no longer rely on a shared reality. It seems that truth is no longer necessarily truth. I will have to be ever conscious (and respectful) of that.
Dana Canedy: Managing editor, Guardian US
It's hard not to have strong views on the topics that will be top of mind for most Americans in the next election, such as abortion, the economy, immigration and foreign policy. But the job of every journalist is timeless: report and present the news accurately, fairly and without fear or favor. That will always be my focus.
Anna Wolfe: Reporter, Mississippi Today
I will write stories that help readers understand the world better, not simply those that elicit strong emotions. My goal is to provide answers to hard questions -- the "why" behind what communities are experiencing. When politics enter my reporting, it will be in the context of accountability and solutions, not personalities.
V Spehar: News creator, Under the Desk News
Objectivity is reserved for the primaries, providing facts and letting the people choose. After that it's respect for humanity and democracy versus authoritarianism. You can't "both sides" that.
William Kristol: Editor at large, The Bulwark
I'm not sure what "remaining objective" really means in these circumstances, and in any case it's not something I think I can do. I'm just going to try to tell the truth as I see it.
Philanthropy
What makes you hopeful about the impact of your work? What discourages you?
Dustin Yellin: Founder and director, Pioneer Works
The transformative potential of accessible, multidisciplinary cultural experiences inspires hope. By breaking down silos and making culture universally accessible, we can foster diverse perspectives while transcending our differences. I am discouraged by the slow rate of progress. How can we forge a common understanding of our world to become a more harmonious, connected and open-minded species within our lifetime?
Jake Wood: Founder and chief executive, Groundswell
I'm hopeful about the pace of technological innovation combined with its rapidly declining price to drive social change across continents and usher in a new era of opportunity -- but discouraged by the prospects of poor government and toxic politics.
La June Montgomery Tabron: President and chief executive, W.K. Kellogg Foundation
Courageous leaders committed to working in solidarity across differences give me hope. The transformation of the systems and structures we need to ensure all children can thrive must be rooted in a DNA-level understanding of solidarity.
Ken Oliver: Executive director, Checkr Foundation
What gives me hope is having business leaders calling me every week wanting to learn about fair-chance hiring -- every conversation a pathway to life-changing possibilities for people. The bubbling narrative against D.E.I. [diversity, equity and inclusion] is discouraging -- that we have to continue to fight for a more inclusive society inside corporate America that reflects the social fabric of America.
Transportation
What mobility challenge keeps you up at night and why?
David Risher: Chief executive, Lyft
Getting people out of their houses and together with one another. Technology makes it almost too easy to stay at home. As the surgeon general has said, "social connection is a fundamental human need, as essential to survival as food, water and shelter." So, what can we do to bring people together more?
Cynthia Williams: Global director of sustainability, homologation and compliance, Ford
Transitioning to zero-emissions solutions, quickly. It will take all sectors participating. We need governments to harmonize environmental requirements; we need one framework to drive a resilient grid faster; we need to grow the infrastructure and educate the consumers on the benefits of zero-emissions vehicles.
U.S.-China Relations
What advice would you give President Biden on the United States' relationship with China?
Jing Tsu: Professor, East Asia studies, Yale; 2023 Pulitzer finalist
China is still evolving and experimenting, and its future is its people. The U.S. should build on long-term expertise beyond the national security lens to gain a wider context for gauging how the Chinese think and the diverse ways in which they feel and relate to the world.
Rana Mitter: Professor and S.T. Lee chair, U.S.-Asia relations, Harvard
The U.S. needs to improve its knowledge base on China. One of the best ways to do this is to get more students to study in China -- learn the language, understand the politics and history, and become an expert on the challenges that are emerging from the world's newest superpower.
Dan Wang: Visiting scholar, Paul Tsai China Center, Yale
The U.S. is in a protracted and multidimensional contest with China. Headlines today are focused on China's overwhelming challenges, but this sentiment has flipped before and can again. What will not change is that China is a manufacturing superpower that still has plenty of growth potential it can tap into. To meet this challenge, President Biden has to strengthen America's ability to build the future, from basic infrastructure to advanced technologies.
Wendy Cutler: Vice president and managing director, Asia Society Policy Institute
We must recognize that we are in the long haul in relationship with China, requiring Washington to be strategic in its approach. We need to "pick our battles" with China. While we have disagreements with China across a wide range of security, economic, ideological and human rights issues, it's important to prioritize those matters that have the greatest impact on the U.S., China, the region and the world, and those where our actions and words can influence outcomes.
Desmond Shum: Investor and author, "Red Roulette: An Insider's Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption and Vengeance in Today's China"
While it's not possible to change the adversary nature of the relationship, the U.S. can look to extract concessions from Xi [Jinping, the Chinese leader]. I would suggest Biden to demand immediate market access to China for exports in swing states and cooperation on U.S. initiatives regarding Ukraine and Israel. In exchange, the U.S. would stand still on new economic sanctions and tech control measures in the coming year. This would be a moratorium on the intensive rivalry of the past years for political expediency.

U.S. to Limit China's Role In E.V. Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration issued new rules to prevent Chinese firms from supplying parts for electric cars set to receive billions of dollars in tax credits.
The Biden administration proposed new rules on Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China.
The rules are meant to limit the role that firms in China can play in supplying materials for electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. They will also discourage companies that seek federal funding to build battery factories in the United States from sourcing materials from China or Russia.
The rules could encourage shifts in automotive supply chains, which continue to rely heavily on China for materials and components of electric vehicles. Automakers are also facing intense cost pressures as they try to modify their factories to make electric cars, and China offers some of the most advanced and lowest-priced battery technology in the world.
The Biden administration is trying to use billions of dollars in new federal funding to change that dynamic and create a U.S. supply chain for electric vehicles.
The climate law that President Biden signed in 2022 includes up to $ 7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy electric vehicles made in the United States using largely domestic materials. The law also included a general ban on Chinese products. Lawmakers mandated that firms in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran be prohibited from providing certain materials to cars that received those tax breaks.
But the law left open several questions, including what constitutes a Chinese or Russian company. Administration officials said those definitions included any entity that was incorporated or had headquarters in China or Russia, as well as any firm in which 25 percent of the board seats or equity interest was held by Chinese or Russian governments.
Chinese companies that set up operations outside China appear to be able to benefit from the rules as long as the Chinese government is not a significant shareholder. That provision came as a relief to some automakers, which feared that the Biden administration might bar them from contracting with Chinese-owned mines or factories in the United States or other parts of the world.
The law also requires battery makers that strike contracts or licensing agreements with Chinese firms to ensure that they are retaining certain rights over their projects. That provision is intended to make sure a Chinese firm is not effectively in control of such a project.
Some conservative lawmakers had challenged Ford Motor's plans to license technology from the Chinese battery giant known as CATL for a plant in Marshall, Mich., arguing that such a partnership should not be eligible for federal tax credits.
Some Republican lawmakers suggested on Friday that the Treasury Department's guidance did not go far enough to lessen the country's dependence on China.
"At a time when China is using massive subsidies to undercut U.S. manufacturers and throttle the global market for battery components, Treasury's naïve new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses," said Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The rules kick in for battery components in 2024, and in 2025 for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. They could be adjusted depending on industry comment.
The rules could have a profound impact on the U.S. electric vehicle market, which is rapidly growing -- battery-powered vehicles made up about 8 percent of new cars sold in the third quarter. Car and battery makers said Friday that they were still reviewing the rules, and that it would take time to determine how many models would qualify for tax credits.
Tesla said on Friday that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the $ 7,500 credit starting in January. The Model Y sport utility vehicle also might not qualify for the full credit after Dec. 31, Tesla said. The Model Y and Model 3 are the top two electric vehicles by sales in the United States. Tesla buys some batteries from CATL.
John Bozzella, the chief executive of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post Friday that the rules struck "a pragmatic balance," including by exempting trace materials. If the administration had banned all minor Chinese parts from the supply chain, no car models might have qualified for tax credits next year, he said.
Many cars have already been disqualified from purchase credits by other rules, like a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. Only about 20 vehicles currently qualify for the program out of more than 100 electric vehicles sold in the United States.
The rules also raised new questions about whether stricter requirements for supply chains could continue a trend of driving more shoppers to lease, rather than buy, vehicles.
The prohibition on sourcing from China applies only to vehicles that are sold, not to those that are leased. Consumers can receive tax credits for electric vehicles they lease from auto dealers, and that has led to a boom in E.V. leasing.
Jack Fitzgerald, chairman of Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which operates dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said he had seen a spike in customers leasing electric vehicles. But he said concern about electric vehicle range and the availability of chargers, more than price, was holding back electric vehicle sales.
"That's the principal thing," Mr. Fitzgerald said.
Auto industry lobbyists have warned that extremely strict rules could stifle electric vehicle sales, and they have urged the administration to strike more trade deals to secure supplies of scarce battery minerals. But Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said the company had structured its electric vehicle operations to be successful regardless of the federal rules.
"We're not anchoring the business on saying this has to happen" with regard to regulations, Mr. Jacobson told reporters on Thursday. If regulations change, he added, "it's not a backbreaking thing for us."
While the rules may create headaches for automakers, they are likely to benefit companies planning to supply batteries from factories in the United States.
"It's actually good news for us," said Siyu Huang, chief executive of Factorial, a Massachusetts company that is developing next-generation electric vehicle batteries with support from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, the owner of Dodge, Jeep and Ram.
Acquiring large amounts of lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, could be difficult because most of the metal is processed in China, Ms. Huang said. But the rules will encourage investment in U.S.-based refineries, she continued. "Its definitely going to be another incentive to build more domestic supply," Ms. Huang said.
John DeMaio, chief executive of Graphex Technologies, which is building a factory in Michigan to process graphite for batteries, said the rules might temporarily slow electric vehicle sales by making it harder to qualify for the tax credit. But in the long run, he added, they will encourage investment in domestic suppliers.
"It might be a hiccup," he said, "but in general it provides certainty and clarity to get people off the fence."
Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department, said in a briefing with reporters that the rules would help advance the administration's goals of building up an American clean energy supply chain while also cutting emissions in the transportation sector.
"These changes take time, but companies are making the investments and Americans are buying these cars," he said.
Over the past year, companies have invested $ 213 billion in the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, building electrification and carbon management technology in the United States, according to tracking by the Rhodium Group and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That is a 37 percent increase from a year earlier.
.
Still, the global electric vehicle industry remains heavily anchored in China, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of electric vehicles. China produces about two-thirds of the world's battery cells, and refines most of the minerals that are key to powering an electric vehicle.
The rules also restrict automakers from sourcing nickel used in their batteries from Russia, which is one of the world's largest nickel producers.
One of the challenges for automakers will be developing systems to track all the components of their battery through a long, and often opaque, supply chain.
Vehicles that are reported incorrectly will be subtracted from an automaker's eligibility for tax credits, Treasury said, and automakers that commit fraud or intentionally disregard the rules could be declared ineligible for the credit in the future.

NEW YORK — Commuters worry their drives into lower Manhattan will cost more. Residents fear their neighborhoods will be swarmed by new traffic. Taxi drivers are terrified of losing more customers.
For years, the same complaints have followed officials on the long road to the nation’s first congestion pricing plan, which will charge drivers a toll for entering much of Manhattan below 60th Street.
Now, as the plan moves closer to becoming reality, officials hope New Yorkers will be won over once they see it in action. The benefits, proponents say, are obvious: reduced traffic and pollution and, eventually, a better transit system.
But some critics still question who will directly benefit most — and who might be harmed.
New Jersey officials accused New York of overburdening its residents with new tolls. Some activists say rerouted truck traffic could worsen asthma rates in the Bronx that are already high.
And the Staten Island borough president, Vito J. Fossella, cited research from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which suggests that parts of the borough could get more vehicles because drivers might travel around the tolling zone.
“This is a three-strike loser for the people of Staten Island,” Fossella said. “Air pollution will get worse on Staten Island. Traffic will get worse.”
In a report released Thursday, an advisory panel to the MTA presented its final recommendations. It called for cars to pay $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street once per day. Commercial trucks would pay as much as $36. Taxis would add $1.25 per fare, and ride-hail apps like Uber and Lyft will tack on an extra $2.50 per ride.
According to the plan, low-income drivers will get 50% off tolls during the day after the first 10 trips in a calendar month. (The vast majority of commuters who drive into Manhattan are not low income, according to a 2022 study by the Community Service Society of New York, an anti-poverty group.)
The authority, the state agency that runs New York City’s subways and buses, would oversee the tolling program, which could begin as soon as next spring. The rates proposed this week will be subject to public hearings before a final vote, which could happen early next year.
Sarah M. Kaufman, the executive director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University, said that other cities with congestion pricing programs have usually experienced resistance from the public during its first six months in operation, but eventually support grows.
“Once people acclimate to the new reality, they are pleasantly surprised by the reduced amount of traffic or how they’ve been able to absorb the extra costs,” Kaufman said. “There is improved road safety and less noise.”
But, for now, the program still has many critics, including a member of the MTA advisory board.
John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport Workers Union, quit the board Thursday in protest. Samuelsen said the fees, credits and exemptions being considered by the authority do not do enough to help drivers who cannot use transit or who cannot afford added costs. He also said the MTA should drastically improve service before the launch of the congestion pricing program in order to encourage more people to ride subways and buses.
“The MTA has stubbornly and moronically stuck to its position that the status quo is adequate,” Samuelsen wrote in a statement. “As a result, we have a congestion pricing plan that is all stick and no carrot.”
Congestion pricing could also drive up the authority’s debt. While the program will provide crucial funding for improvements to the transit network, a May 2023 report from Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, notes that much of that funding is projected to come from leveraging bonds that would drive the authority’s debt up to $56.7 billion by 2028.
Some experts worry that traffic diverted by the tolls could create new choke points outside the zone.
The new report recommends charging yellow cab passengers less than those who use for-hire vehicles, to assuage concerns that rider demand will drop and put cabs at a disadvantage against Uber and Lyft. But to cabbies’ frustration, it does not give them the full exemption they had sought.
Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which calls for better working conditions for taxi and app-based drivers, said the proposal would “devastate an entire workforce.” An Uber spokesperson said the MTA should offer discounts for late-night use of taxis and Ubers instead of personal vehicles in order to combat drunken driving.
What everyone can agree on is that congestion pricing will raise billions of dollars intended to improve the continent’s largest mass transit network while pushing cars out of one of the world’s busiest commercial corridors.
“Congestion pricing will reduce congestion in the region’s traffic-choked core and raise critically needed funds for mass transit,” said Tom Wright, the president and CEO of the Regional Plan Association, a group that has advocated for congestion pricing. “The policy will benefit the vast majority of commuters, residents and businesses in the region who rely on mass transit and will benefit drivers who suffer under some of the worst traffic conditions in the nation.”
But the association also recommended changes to the proposed rates by increasing credits being given to drivers entering the zone through tunnels and bridges.
Reactions to the program were mixed among residents of the tolling zone, with some expressing support and others critical of the added costs for drivers. Those who live inside the zone have to pay the tolls, but if they earn less than $60,000, they can get state tax credits to offset the costs.
Shantee Lundee, 38, of Hell’s Kitchen, relies on her car to get around as a dog walker and hospice worker. Lundee said she has recently had to raise her rates because of rising cost of living. The likely arrival of congestion prices, she said, was the “final straw” in her recent decision to move to Long Island.
“We can’t pick ourselves up,” Lundee said. “There’s no breaks.”

U.S. to Limit China’s Ability to Benefit From Electric Vehicle Industry

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration proposed new rules Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China.
The rules are meant to limit the role that Chinese firms can play in supplying materials for electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. They will also discourage companies that seek federal funding to build battery factories in the United States from sourcing materials from China or Russia.
The rules could encourage shifts in automotive supply chains, which continue to rely heavily on China for materials and components of electric vehicles. Automakers are also facing intense cost pressures as they try to modify their factories to make electric cars; China offers some of the most advanced and lowest-priced battery technology in the world.
The Biden administration is trying to use billions of dollars in new federal funding to change that dynamic and create a U.S. supply chain for electric vehicles.
The climate law President Joe Biden signed in 2022 includes up to $7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy electric vehicles made in the United States, using largely domestic materials. The law also included a general ban on Chinese products. Lawmakers mandated that firms in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran be prohibited from providing certain materials to cars that received those tax breaks.
But the law left open several questions, including what constitutes a Chinese or Russian company. Administration officials said those definitions included any entity that was incorporated or had headquarters in China or Russia, as well as any firm in which 25% of the board seats or equity interest was held by Chinese or Russian governments.
Chinese companies that set up operations outside China appear to be able to benefit from the rules, as long as the Chinese government is not a significant shareholder. That provision came as a relief to automakers, which feared that the Biden administration might ban them from contracting with Chinese-owned mines or factories in the United States or other parts of the world.
The law also requires battery makers that strike contracts or licensing agreements with Chinese firms to ensure that they are retaining certain rights over their projects. That provision is intended to make sure a Chinese firm is not effectively in control of such a project.
Some conservative lawmakers had challenged Ford Motor Co.’s plans to license technology from the Chinese battery giant known as CATL for a plant in Marshall, Michigan, arguing that such a partnership should not be eligible for federal tax credits.
Some Republican lawmakers suggested Friday that the Treasury Department’s guidance did not go far enough to lessen the country’s dependence on China.
“At a time when China is using massive subsidies to undercut U.S. manufacturers and throttle the global market for battery components, Treasury’s naive new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The rules kick in for battery components in 2024 and in 2025 for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. They could be adjusted depending on industry comment.
The rules could have a profound effect on the U.S. electric vehicle market, which is rapidly growing; battery-powered vehicles made up about 8% of new cars sold in the third quarter. Car and battery makers said Friday that they were still reviewing the rules and that it would take time to determine how many models would qualify for tax credits.
Tesla said Friday that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the $7,500 credit starting in January. The Model Y SUV also might not qualify for the full credit after Dec. 31, Tesla said. The Model Y and Model 3 are the top two electric vehicles by sales in the United States. Tesla buys some batteries from CATL.
John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post Friday that the rules struck “a pragmatic balance,” including by exempting trace materials. If the administration had banned all minor Chinese parts from the supply chain, no car models might have qualified for tax credits next year, he said.
Many cars have already been disqualified from purchase credits by other rules, like a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. Only about 20 vehicles currently qualify for the program out of more than 100 electric vehicles sold in the United States.
The rules also raised new questions about whether stricter requirements for supply chains could continue a trend of driving more shoppers to lease, rather than buy, vehicles.
The prohibition on sourcing from China applies only to vehicles that are sold, not to those that are leased. Consumers can receive tax credits for electric vehicles they lease from auto dealers, and that has led to a boom in EV leasing.
Jack Fitzgerald, chair of Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which operates dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said he had seen a spike in customers leasing electric vehicles. But he said concern about electric vehicle range and the availability of chargers, more than price, was holding back electric vehicle sales.
“That’s the principal thing,” Fitzgerald said.
Auto industry lobbyists have warned that extremely strict rules could stifle electric vehicle sales, and they have urged the administration to strike more trade deals to secure supplies of scarce battery minerals. But Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer of General Motors, said the company had structured its electric vehicle operations to be successful regardless of the federal rules.
“We’re not anchoring the business on saying this has to happen” with regard to regulations, Jacobson told reporters Thursday. If regulations change, he added, “it’s not a backbreaking thing for us.”
While the rules may create headaches for automakers, they are likely to benefit companies planning to supply batteries from factories in the United States.
“It’s actually good news for us,” said Siyu Huang, CEO of Factorial, a Massachusetts company that is developing next-generation electric vehicle batteries with support from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, the owner of Dodge, Jeep and Ram.
Acquiring large amounts of lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, could be difficult because most of the metal is processed in China, Huang said. But the rules will encourage investment in U.S.-based refineries, she continued. “Its definitely going to be another incentive to build more domestic supply,” Huang said.
John DeMaio, CEO of Graphex Technologies, which is building a factory in Michigan to process graphite for batteries, said the rules might temporarily slow electric vehicle sales by making it harder to qualify for the tax credit. But in the long run, he added, they will encourage investment in domestic suppliers.
“It might be a hiccup,” he said, “but in general, it provides certainty and clarity to get people off the fence.”
Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury Department, said in a briefing with reporters that the rules would help advance the administration’s goals of building up a U.S. clean energy supply chain while also cutting emissions in the transportation sector.
“These changes take time, but companies are making the investments, and Americans are buying these cars,” he said.
Over the past year, companies have invested $213 billion in the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, building electrification and carbon management technology in the United States, according to tracking by the Rhodium Group and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Companies Find Way to Spot Trustworthy A.I. Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mainstream companies have concerns about the lineage of the data that powers A.I. applications. An industry group is addressing that challenge.
Data is the fuel of artificial intelligence. It is also a bottleneck for big businesses, because they are reluctant to fully embrace the technology without knowing more about the data used to build A.I. programs.
Now, a consortium of companies has developed standards for describing the origin, history and legal rights to data. The standards are essentially a labeling system for where, when and how data was collected and generated, as well as its intended use and restrictions.
The data provenance standards, announced on Thursday, have been developed by the Data & Trust Alliance, a nonprofit group made up of two dozen mainly large companies and organizations, including American Express, Humana, IBM, Pfizer, UPS and Walmart, as well as a few start-ups.
The alliance members believe the data-labeling system will be similar to the fundamental standards for food safety that require basic information like where food came from, who produced and grew it and who handled the food on its way to a grocery shelf.
Greater clarity and more information about the data used in A.I. models, executives say, will bolster corporate confidence in the technology. How widely the proposed standards will be used is uncertain, and much will depend on how easy the standards are to apply and automate. But standards have accelerated the use of every significant technology, from electricity to the internet.
"This is a step toward managing data as an asset, which is what everyone in industry is trying to do today," said Ken Finnerty, president for information technology and data analytics at UPS. "To do that, you have to know where the data was created, under what circumstances, its intended purpose and where it's legal to use or not."
Surveys point to the need for greater confidence in data and for improved efficiency in data handling. In one poll of corporate chief executives, a majority cited "concerns about data lineage or provenance" as a key barrier to A.I. adoption. And a survey of data scientists found that they spent nearly 40 percent of their time on data preparation tasks.
The data initiative is mainly intended for business data that companies use to make their own A.I. programs or data they may selectively feed into A.I. systems from companies like Google, OpenAI, Microsoft and Anthropic. The more accurate and trustworthy the data, the more reliable the A.I.-generated answers.
For years, companies have been using A.I. in applications that range from tailoring product recommendations to predicting when jet engines will need maintenance.
But the rise in the past year of the so-called generative A.I. that powers chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT has heightened concerns about the use and misuse of data. These systems can generate text and computer code with humanlike fluency, yet they often make things up -- "hallucinate," as researchers put it -- depending on the data they access and assemble.
Companies do not typically allow their workers to freely use the consumer versions of the chatbots. But they are using their own data in pilot projects that use the generative capabilities of the A.I. systems to help write business reports, presentations and computer code. And that corporate data can come from many sources, including customers, suppliers, weather and location data.
"The secret sauce is not the model," said Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president of software. "It's the data."
In the new system, there are eight basic standards, including lineage, source, legal rights, data type and generation method. Then there are more detailed descriptions for most of the standards -- such as noting that the data came from social media or industrial sensors, for example.
The data documentation can be done in a variety of widely used technical formats. Companies in the data consortium have been testing the standards to improve and refine them, and the plan is to make them available to the public early next year.
Labeling data by type, date and source has been done by individual companies and industries. But the consortium says these are the first detailed standards meant to be used across all industries.
"My whole life I've spent drowning in data and trying to figure out what I can use and what is accurate, " said Thi Montalvo, a data scientist and vice president of reporting and analytics at Transcarent.
Transcarent, a member of the data consortium, is a start-up that relies on data analysis and machine-learning models to personalize health care and speed payment to providers.
The benefit of the data standards, Ms. Montalvo said, comes from greater transparency for everyone in the data supply chain. That work flow often begins with negotiating contracts with insurers for access to claims data and continues with the start-up's data scientists, statisticians and health economists who build predictive models to guide treatment for patients.
At each stage, knowing more about the data sooner should increase efficiency and eliminate repetitive work, potentially reducing the time spent on data projects by 15 to 20 percent, Ms. Montalvo estimates.
The data consortium says the A.I. market today needs the clarity the group's data-labeling standards can provide. "This can help solve some of the problems in A.I. that everyone is talking about," said Chris Hazard, a co-founder and the chief technology officer of Howso, a start-up that makes data-analysis tools and A.I. software.

Full text: Elon Musk, the owner of X, criticized advertisers with expletives on Wednesday at The New York Times's DealBook Summit.
Advertisers said on Thursday that they did not plan to reopen their wallets anytime soon with X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, after its owner, Elon Musk, insulted brands using an expletive and told them not to spend on the platform.
At least half a dozen marketing agencies said the brands they represent were standing firm against advertising on X, while others said they had advised advertisers to stop posting anything on the platform. Some temporary spending pauses that advertisers have enacted in recent weeks against X are likely to turn into permanent freezes, they added, with Mr. Musk's comments giving them no incentive to return.
Advertisers are "not coming back" to X, said Lou Paskalis, the founder and chief executive of AJL Advisory, a marketing consultancy. "There is no advertising value that would offset the reputational risk of going back on the platform."
Mr. Musk has repeatedly criticized and alienated advertisers since buying Twitter last year. At one point, he threatened a "thermonuclear name & shame" against advertisers who paused their spending because they were concerned about his plans to loosen content moderation rules on X.
In recent weeks, more than 200 advertisers had halted their spending on X after Mr. Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory and researchers called attention to instances of ads appearing alongside pro-Nazi posts on the platform. The company, which has made most of its revenue from advertising, is at risk of losing up to $ 75 million this quarter as brands back away.
The situation was compounded on Wednesday when Mr. Musk made incendiary comments against advertisers at the DealBook Summit in New York. In a wide-ranging interview at the event, Mr. Musk apologized for the antisemitic post, calling it "one of the most foolish" he had ever published, but also said that advertisers were trying to "blackmail" him. He singled out Bob A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, who also attended the DealBook Summit.
"Don't advertise," Mr. Musk then said, using an expletive multiple times to emphasize his point.
Hours later, Linda Yaccarino, X's chief executive, tried to mitigate the damage. In a post on X, she shifted attention to Mr. Musk's apology for associating himself with antisemitism and appealed to advertisers to return.
"X is enabling an information independence that is uncomfortable for some people," Ms. Yaccarino wrote. "X is standing at a unique and amazing intersection of Free Speech and Main Street -- and the X community is powerful and here to welcome you."
A representative for X did not respond to a request for comment.
Ruben Schreurs, the chief strategy officer at Ebiquity, a marketing and media consulting firm, said Ms. Yaccarino appeared to be trying to get brands to stand with X's views on free speech. But advertisers were unlikely to step in to sponsor the social media platform's goals, he said.
"It doesn't resonate at all," he said, adding that the spending pauses seemed to be "turning into a termination of advertising on X." Short of a leadership change or a change in control at the company, he added, advertisers were unlikely to consider returning to the platform.
Other marketers are recommending that brands abandon X altogether. Tom Hespos, a longtime media planning executive who runs a consulting firm, Abydos Media, and works with clients in health care and other industries with up to $ 50 million media budgets, said that he gave his first formal recommendation to a client on Thursday that they not only stop spending on X but back away from posting there.
"You can't with a good conscience make a recommendation to a client that they continue to be a part of" what Mr. Musk has done on X, Mr. Hespos said.
Mr. Musk's rejection of advertisers highlights the challenges facing Ms. Yaccarino, an advertising industry veteran, as she tries to stabilize X's revenue. The last three months of the year have historically been lucrative for X, as major advertisers typically launch campaigns for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and holiday shopping.
Among the brands that have been big spenders on X and that have recently halted their campaigns are Apple, Disney and IBM. Other brands have remained, including the National Football League and The New York Times's sports site, The Athletic.
At the DealBook event on Wednesday, Mr. Musk acknowledged that an extended advertiser boycott could bankrupt X. But the public would blame the failure on brands, he said, not on him.
"I will certainly not pander," he said.
Mr. Musk's dismissiveness of advertiser concerns has caused brands to view him as a risky partner, said Steve Boehler, the founder of the marketing management consultancy Mercer Island Group.
Mr. Musk's "comments suggest an outrageous amount of uncertainty regarding his platform, how he will partner with advertisers and whether he even cares about what advertisers think," said Mr. Boehler, who works with clients who spend $ 10 million to $ 500 million on advertising annually. "This is also personal," he added. "Businesses are simply full of people, and people like to be treated well, respected and dealt with with dignity."

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

The move comes weeks after the UAW won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25% or more over 4 1/2 years for its 146,000 members employed there.

Electric Cars Face Rules On China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some firms argue that a law aimed at popularizing electric vehicles risks turning the United States into an assembly shop for Chinese-made technology.
The Biden administration has been trying to jump-start the domestic supply chain for electric vehicles so cleaner cars can be made in the United States. But the experience of one Texas company, whose plans to help make an all-American electric vehicle were upended by China, highlights the stakes involved as the administration finalizes rules governing the industry.
Huntsman Corporation started construction two years ago on a $ 50 million plant in Texas to make ethylene carbonate, a chemical that is used in electric vehicle batteries. It would have been the only site in North America making the product, with the goal of feeding battery factories that would crop up to serve the electric vehicle market.
But as new facilities in China came online and flooded the market, the price of the chemical plummeted to $ 700 a ton from $ 4,000. After pumping $ 30 million into the project, the company halted work on it this year. "If we were to start the project up today, we would be hemorrhaging cash," said Peter R. Huntsman, the company's chief executive. "I'd essentially be paying people to take the product."
The Biden administration is now finalizing rules that will help determine whether companies like Huntsman will find it profitable enough to participate in America's electric vehicle industry. The rules, which are expected to be proposed this week, will dictate the extent to which foreign companies, particularly in China, can supply parts and products for American-made vehicles that are set to receive billions of dollars in subsidies.
The administration is offering up to $ 7,500 in tax credits to Americans who buy electric vehicles, in an effort to supercharge the industry and reduce the country's carbon emissions. The rules will determine whether electric vehicle makers seeking to benefit from that program will have the flexibility to get cheap components from China, or whether they will be required instead to buy more expensive products from U.S.-based firms like Huntsman.
The lawmakers who wrote the climate bill, including Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat, included language that bars an electric car from qualifying for the tax breaks if the critical minerals or other components used in its battery were made by "a foreign entity of concern." Lawmakers defined that as any firm that is owned by, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction of North Korea, China, Russia or Iran.
But they left it up to the Biden administration to fill in the details, including important questions like what constitutes a Chinese company, and what product qualifies as a "battery component."
The administration faces a tricky calculation with the new rules. If it allows more companies to qualify for the benefits, Americans will have a wider choice of low-cost electric vehicles to choose from. That would put more clean cars on the road and help to mitigate climate change. It could also help to shore up the finances of U.S. automakers that are losing heavily on electric vehicle production.
But such a path could undercut the administration's other priority -- to build more secure supply chains for electric vehicles. The government has been aiming to use the climate law to boost manufacturing of electric vehicles and their parts in the United States and in allied countries, and reduce dependency on China, which dominates global markets for electric vehicles and their batteries.
The effort to balance these concerns has touched off a fight between automakers and parts manufacturers, U.S. miners and labor unions.
Automakers have been awaiting the guidelines with trepidation.
Carmakers like General Motors and Hyundai, spurred by the new climate law, are racing to build factories in the United States to produce batteries and process materials like lithium. But they are still years away from being able to produce an electric vehicle without materials and components from China, auto industry representatives say.
China dominates production of materials, like graphite and processed lithium, that are essential to the flow of electricity within a battery, and to the cathodes and anodes, the basic building blocks of a battery. Through both formidable government subsidies and enormous economies of scale, Chinese firms now sell some of the world's most advanced electric vehicles and the components used to make them at much lower prices than competitors in other countries.
Automakers are also under intense pressure to keep costs down by buying from the cheapest suppliers. Ford Motor lost $ 1.3 billion on electric vehicles in the third quarter, the company said last month, equaling a loss of $ 36,000 on every vehicle it sold.
In June, Tesla, which sources key parts from China, submitted comments to the government arguing that the coming restrictions on foreign entities should be less restrictive. The limits on foreign purchases should be confined to major battery parts, like the cathode and anode, not the various minerals or other parts used to make them, Tesla proposed.
In the worst case, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, "you can have vehicles made in the U.S., with the vast majority of parts coming from the U.S., that could be disqualified from the tax credit because a single part comes from China." Mr. Gore, whose organization counts Tesla as well as battery makers as members, said he expected the administration to strike a balance.
In contrast, miners and other makers of battery materials and components say that allowing China to supply cheap parts could open the United States to a flood of foreign products. That would ensure that the United States was merely an assembly point for Chinese-made technology and products, and leave the U.S. economy highly vulnerable, they say.
So far, the climate law appears to have done more to stimulate investment in factories to make electric vehicles and their batteries than in the mines and facilities that produce the minerals, chemicals and smaller components that go into the battery itself.
In fact, the only cobalt mine planned in the United States, owned by Jervois in Idaho, temporarily closed this year. The company blamed cratering prices, caused by a new rush of material produced by China. Jervois restarted some exploratory drilling this fall, thanks to new funding from the Defense Department.
Until the final rules are issued, some companies have halted plans for new U.S. investment, conscious that their business calculations could change significantly in the coming months.
"You're seeing a bit of a holding pattern until the final guidance is released by the administration," said Abigail Seadler Wulf, the vice president and director of critical minerals strategy at Securing America's Future Energy, a nonprofit organization.
Mr. Huntsman said that unless the government restricted the use of Chinese materials, there was no point in investing further in the company's Texas project. He said the Chinese government was heavily subsidizing the production of ethylene carbonate, allowing Chinese firms that account for 90 percent of the global production of the chemical to sell it so cheaply.
"The question, really, is how does the United States want to respond to this?" he asked.

Full text: Internal documents show companies like Airbnb, Coca-Cola and Microsoft have halted ads, or may do so, after Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, could lose as much as $ 75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pause their marketing campaigns after its owner, Elon Musk, endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month.
Internal documents viewed by The New York Times this week show that the company is in a more difficult position than previously known and that concerns about Mr. Musk and the platform have spread far beyond companies including IBM, Apple and Disney, which paused their advertising campaigns on X last week. The documents list more than 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft, many of which have halted or are considering pausing their ads on the social network.
The documents come from X's sales team and are meant to track the impact of all the advertising lapses this month, including those by companies that have already paused and others that may be at risk of doing so. They list how much ad revenue X employees fear the company could lose through the end of the year if advertisers do not return.
On Friday, X said in a statement that $ 11 million in revenue was at risk and that the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending. The company said the numbers viewed by The Times were either outdated or represented an internal exercise to evaluate total risk.
The advertising freezes come during the final three months of the year, which is traditionally the social media company's strongest quarter as brands run holiday promotions for events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In the last three months of 2021 -- the last year the company reported fourth-quarter earnings before Mr. Musk took over -- the company recorded $ 1.57 billion in revenue, of which nearly 90 percent came from advertising.
Since Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter last year, some brands have been hesitant to advertise on the platform, concerned with Mr. Musk's behavior and content moderation decisions, which have led to a rise in incendiary and hateful content. U.S. advertising on the platform is down nearly 60 percent this year, prompting the company to try to woo back advertisers in an effort its chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, is spearheading. X is also campaigning for advertisers to return during the holiday period to make up for revenue shortfalls earlier in the year.
The documents, however, reveal that has not been going to plan. More than 100 brands are shown as having "fully paused" their ads while dozens of others are listed as "at risk." Many paused on or after Nov. 15, when Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X that the conspiracy theory that Jews supported the immigration of minorities to replace white populations was "the actual truth."
Leesha Anderson, the vice president of digital marketing and social media at the advertising agency Outcast, said its clients steadily stopped spending on X after Mr. Musk took over and had found alternatives on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok.
"In today's dynamic marketplace, brands have a plethora of platform choices at their disposal for precise audience targeting," she said. "Therefore, it is imperative for the stewards and proprietors of social platforms to exercise deliberate discretion in all aspects, be it their personal beliefs or political stances, as these choices will inevitably undergo public scrutiny."
The organizations that have paused their ads on X range from political campaigns to fast food chains to tech giants, according to the documents. Airbnb, for example, halted more than $ 1 million of advertising, while Uber cut back on ads worth more than $ 800,000, halting campaigns in U.S. and international markets. Both tech companies declined to comment.
Other large brands, including Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix, paused some of their campaigns. Netflix's halted ads were worth nearly $ 3 million, according to X's estimates. Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.
Various subsidiaries of Microsoft have also stopped advertising -- leading to a potential loss of more than $ 4 million in revenue for X's fourth quarter, based on the documents -- as have Amazon's units for books and music and one subsidiary of Google. The search giant and some other brands that have paused spending, including NBC Universal, have continued to post content on the platform without paying X to ensure it reaches a broad audience.
Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not return requests for comment.
On the NBC program "Meet the Press" last Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie called Mr. Musk's comment part of a recent outpouring of an "outrageous type of hate."
"Whether it's Elon Musk, whether it's professors on our college campuses or students that they are misleading, or whether it's individuals who are speaking out in an antisemitic way on the streets of our cities," he said.
Two days before Mr. Christie's appearance, a super PAC supporting him, called Tell It Like It Is, pulled its advertising from X, according to the documents. A representative for the political fund-raising group did not respond to a request for comment.
In an internal meeting with employees at X this week, Ms. Yaccarino cut a defiant mood. She made no mention of Mr. Musk's endorsement of the antisemitic post and attributed the company's problems to a report by the left-wing media watchdog group Media Matters, which showed that ads on X from companies like IBM and Apple appeared next to posts promoting white nationalist and Nazi content.
On Monday, after Mr. Musk called Media Matters "an evil organization," X sued the group and argued that its report, which was published after Mr. Musk's statement, "manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X's largest advertisers' paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content." Ms. Yaccarino has blamed the Media Matters report for X's declining ad sales.
"Kowtowing to external criticism or pressures is simply not how X will ever operate," she wrote in an email to X employees on Wednesday that was seen by The Times. "The people at X are free speech defenders. We stand in solidarity with those who believe in this fundamental right and the critical checks and balances of a thriving democracy."
Earlier this week, Mr. Musk spent time celebrating companies that have continued to advertise on X, including the National Football League. Using a heart emoji, X's billionaire owner said he loved the N.F.L. (The New York Times largely stopped marketing on the platform in early 2023, though the company's sports publication, The Athletic, has continued to purchase ads, according to a spokesman.)
Mr. Musk also noted that the company would donate "all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza." The funding will include revenue from ads bought by charity groups, news organizations and other groups that advertised content related to the conflict.
Following her boss, Ms. Yaccarino added to Mr. Musk's original post with a plea.
"Lean in and help," she wrote on X.

Renewed Interest in a Rare Employee Benefit: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the downsides of 401(k)-style plans become apparent, workers and some companies, including IBM, are showing new interest in defined benefit plans.
In an economy characterized by a volatile stock market and elevated inflation, a sure thing looks better than ever. For some Americans in the labor force right now, that looks like a pension.
Striking members of the United Automobile Workers union made waves this year when the union's leaders demanded the reopening of defined-benefit pension plans for workers hired after late 2007. Although U.A.W. leadership failed to persuade automakers to reopen the plans, the bold move didn't go unnoticed by retirement benefit experts.
"It was interesting that U.A.W. did mention that in their negotiations, because that isn't really something you would have seen 10 years ago," said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.
Only about one in 10 Americans working in the private sector today participates in a defined-benefit pension plan, while roughly half contribute to 401(k)-type, defined-contribution plans, which are funded with their pretax dollars and, in many cases, employer contributions.
Experts say the shortcomings of defined-contribution plans, with their assets invested by employees themselves, are more apparent in the current economic climate.
"Many American workers are seeing that it's a lot harder to have those accounts work," said Josh Cohen, head of client solutions for PGIM DC Solutions, a division of Prudential Financial. "That's heightened with market volatility, inflation and increased longevity."
The competitive labor market has prompted more job hunters to seek out employers that offer richer benefits. The jobs platform Indeed found that over the past three years, people looking for work have increased searches for pensions by roughly 12 percent.
There are indications that companies are increasingly responding. Indeed also found that, while the number of job postings that mention pensions remains low, that figure has shot up roughly 130 percent over the past three years.
Even before the pandemic and its economic upheaval, there was evidence that employees -- including young Americans who entered the work force after 401(k)s became dominant -- placed a high value on defined-benefit pensions. A report published in 2020 by the National Institute on Retirement Security found that more than four out of five millennials working in the public sector cited pensions as a key reason for staying in their jobs.
The jobs platform Glassdoor found that employers with pensions had an edge over rivals in employee satisfaction, which can improve recruitment and retention. Employers offering pensions have earned consistently higher ratings on the site over the past decade. Benefit ratings for jobs with pensions averaged 4.37 out of a possible 5, compared with 4.21 for jobs without pension benefits.
"I would characterize that as a pretty large and persistent advantage," said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor.
For Jessica Steinbach, the chance to take a job with a pension right out of college was a "crazy-amazing opportunity."
Although Ms. Steinbach, 27, earned a college degree in the performing arts, she works as an assistant naturalist for the parks department of Dutchess County in the Hudson River Valley of New York, where she runs educational programs for children and adults.
Ms. Steinbach said her parents had helped her see the long-term benefit of participating in a pension plan starting from a young age.
"My parents said the stability of having a county job with a pension would be great," she said. "They expressed how rare that is." Her peers find it surprising, too.
She said that seeing her parents get closer to retirement gave her a better long-term perspective. "Thirty years isn't that long, and it snuck up on them, so it will sneak up on me," she said, adding that she appreciates the guarantee of an additional income stream to supplement Social Security when she is older. "It does feel slightly more stable to have the pension."
Although pensions are still common in public-sector jobs, they are nearly absent in the private sector. But there are hints that the tide could be turning.
In November, IBM announced a significant change to the way it structures its retirement benefits. The company is a benefits bellwether in corporate America. It was one of the first to offer a 401(k), in 1983. IBM is keeping its 401(k) plan, but beginning next year, it will eliminate matching contributions of up to 6 percent. Instead, it will contribute 5 percent of each worker's pay into a defined-benefit instrument.
This retirement benefit account, as the company is calling it, differs from traditional defined-benefit pensions in that its structure is that of a cash-balance account, in which the accrued value is expressed as a dollar amount. Workers earn credit each year, typically a percentage of their salary plus an interest rate pegged to a benchmark like a particular Treasury yield.
"To me, this is a little bit of a back-to-the-future movement, where IBM, in a sense, is going back in time," said John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at the investment research firm Morningstar. "It's a different structure, but it has a little bit of an old-school feel."
Employees who don't currently contribute to a retirement account are poised to see the greatest advantage from this switch, said Michael Archer, head of the retirement business for North America at WTW, a benefits advisory firm.
"In defined-contribution plans, most require the employee to contribute to get a contribution from the employer, but the problem with that common approach is many employees that are lower paid or younger find it very difficult to make those contributions," Mr. Archer said.
Conversely, a primary drawback of traditional defined-benefit pensions is that they are structured to reward workers who spend their entire career with the same employer -- a career model not especially well suited to today's young, mobile work force.
Defined-benefit plans structured as cash-balance plans, such as IBM's, let workers accrue money for retirement consistently without requiring a tenure measured in decades. "Cash balance plans are built to increase portability so you can take a lump sum when you leave," said Jared Gross, head of institutional portfolio strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Another disadvantage of traditional defined-benefit pensions is that payments stop when the worker -- or the worker's spouse -- dies. While workers with 401(k)s risk outliving their savings, they can designate a beneficiary to receive the funds after their death.
One possible solution, benefits experts say, is for companies to offer some sort of hybrid retirement package that includes both defined-benefit and defined-contribution elements. In a report co-written by Mr. Gross and published this year by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, analysts suggested that large companies with dormant pension plans -- either closed or still paying out to older retirees but inaccessible to younger workers -- could reap benefits by reopening or unfreezing those plans as a complement to a defined-contribution plan.
"I think the likely path is that this is in addition to a D.C. plan," Mr. Gross said. "What we're likely to see going forward is a parallel structure."
While economists point to signs of slowing momentum in the labor market as potential evidence that workers' retirement gains may be short-lived, they also note that continual baby boomer retirement waves mean employers will need to compete more fiercely to hire and keep employees.
"Structurally, the trend in the long run is that workers are going to be more valuable, especially when we think about the kinds of industries that are going to need more workers in the future," Mr. Zhao, the Glassdoor economist, said. He noted continued strength in sectors, such as health care, that rely on in-person work that can't be automated or outsourced.
"When you go through periods of volatility or inflation," Mr. Gross said, "or for people who are concerned about the adequacy of their retirement savings, the perception of defined-benefit plans rises because they provide long-term, stable income."
Two additional worries -- the viability of Social Security and mounting government debt -- are weighing on the minds of young workers and investors today, and the prospect of a guaranteed return becomes more appealing.
"With this shift in this higher-inflation environment, you're getting more people cognizant of what is it going to cost to live in retirement," said Ned McGuire, a managing director at the investment advisory firm Wilshire. "Employees are starting to catch on to the fact that retirement is unpredictable and potentially very expensive."
There are indications that young adults are increasingly concerned about the reliability of Social Security. In a Nationwide Retirement Institute survey, 45 percent of adults younger than 27 said they didn't believe they would receive any money from the program.
"If you're a 20-year-old and you're looking at your future life span, you don't necessarily know that you're going to collect a Social Security benefit at the same level that your parents are receiving," Mr. McGuire said. "It's just so much more in the zeitgeist."

Broadcom Closes Deal for Cloud Firm VMware
Broadcom on Wednesday closed its $ 69 billion acquisition of the cloud-computing firm VMware after receiving regulatory approval in its last major market, China, and ending a monthslong saga.
The deal, one of the biggest globally when announced in May 2022, was the latest in the chief executive Hock Tan's efforts to increase the chipmaker's software business.
China's regulatory approval came through on Tuesday after ongoing tensions with the U.S. around tougher chip export control measures had stoked fears among some investors on the company's ability to close the deal before the Nov. 26 deadline.

Volkswagen Will Raise Salaries at Factory 11%
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would raise salaries 11 percent for production workers at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., weeks after the United Auto Workers union won major pay and benefit increases from the three Detroit automakers.
The company and other nonunion automakers in the U.S. have come under increased pressure to improve pay and benefits after the record contracts achieved by the U.A.W. in late October after thousands of its members went on a six-week targeted strike.
Honda and Toyota have raised wages for nonunion U.S. factory workers in recent weeks amid signs that the union is turning its attention to organizing the work force at foreign-owned and Tesla auto plants.
Hyundai Motor has also announced a 25 percent increase over the next four years for nonunion production workers in Alabama and Georgia. REUTERS

Higher Borrowing Costs Could Hinder Deere
Deere forecast 2024 profits below analysts' expectations on Wednesday, saying high borrowing costs and tighter budgets will likely dent demand for the farm equipment maker's agriculture and construction machinery.
Deere, a barometer for the global economy, predicted a downturn in agriculture and construction equipment sales across all of its regions for the fiscal year ahead, validating analysts' concern that demand may have peaked for big industrial companies.
The company now expects 2024 net income between $ 7.75 billion and $ 8.25 billion, far below the consensus for $ 9.33 billion, according to LSEG data.
The heavy equipment maker's net income for the quarter rose to $ 2.37 billion, or $ 8.26 per share.
Despite beating Wall Street profit estimates, the manufacturer's stock slump mirrors peers such as Caterpillar that also outperformed forecasts. REUTERS

As Brands Flee, X Sues Media Matters Over Research on Ads and Antisemitic Posts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: X asked a federal court to order the advocacy group to take down its findings, accusing it of "manipulating the algorithms."
X, the social media service formerly known as Twitter, sued Media Matters in federal court on Monday after the advocacy organization published research showing that ads on X appeared next to antisemitic content.
A post last week from Elon Musk that endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which he wrote a day before the Media Matters research was published, kicked off an advertiser exodus, with major brands like IBM, Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sony pausing their spending on the platform.
X has rejected Media Matters' findings, saying they were not representative of a regular user's experience on the platform. On Friday, Mr. Musk promised a "thermonuclear lawsuit" against Media Matters and its backers.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claims that Media Matters tried to damage X's relationships with advertisers. "Media Matters has manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X's largest advertisers' paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content, leaving the false impression that these pairings are anything but what they actually are: manufactured, inorganic and extraordinarily rare," lawyers for X wrote in the complaint.
Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, said in a statement, "This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X's critics into silence." He added that his organization "stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court." On Monday night, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also announced that his office would open an investigation into Media Matters for "potential fraudulent activity."
Brands have been hesitant to advertise on X since Mr. Musk bought the company a year ago and said he would relax its content-moderation policies. X has sought to woo hesitant advertisers back to the platform, an initiative that has been overseen by Linda Yaccarino, a longtime advertising executive who became X's chief executive in June.
But Mr. Musk's post on Wednesday, in which he agreed with a post from an X account accusing Jewish communities of pushing "hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them," was a setback.
"You have said the actual truth," Mr. Musk replied to the post.
Jewish groups quickly condemned the statement that Mr. Musk endorsed, likening it to the "Great Replacement Theory," a conspiracy theory that claims minorities are replacing white European populations as part of a coordinated effort by Jewish people. The White House condemned Mr. Musk's remark, and top-tier brands quickly pulled their advertising off X.
Mr. Musk said in a post to X on Sunday that claims that he was antisemitic were untrue. "Nothing could be further from the truth," he wrote.
In its lawsuit, X asked the court to order Media Matters to take down its published research. The lawsuit also seeks unspecified monetary damages and lawyers' fees.
Ms. Yaccarino said in a statement that the X account that Media Matters had used in its research was the only account that saw some of the ads next to the antisemitic posts in question. In the case of Apple, its ad was placed next to an antisemitic post and viewed by another user, she added.
"If you know me, you know I'm committed to truth and fairness," Ms. Yaccarino said in a post on X. "Data wins over manipulation or allegations. Don't be manipulated. Stand with X."
During an all-staff meeting on Monday, Ms. Yaccarino said she had discussed the issue with advertisers and was committed to defending X, according to audio of the meeting heard by The New York Times. In those conversations, some advertisers had asked her to be more communicative about problems to get in front of them, and to share more data about how ads are displayed on the platform, she said.
"We want to work with all of our partners who stand with us and believe in the power and the necessity of free speech," Ms. Yaccarino said. "Sometimes in life and in business, standing for your values is the truly defining thing that makes leaders, and we're going to hold on to that and keep pushing forward. No critic is ever going to deter us from our mission to keep fighting and protecting free speech."
In the roughly 30-minute meeting, Ms. Yaccarino focused the blame on Media Matters and did not address Mr. Musk's endorsement of the antisemitic post.
She also encouraged employees to be frugal during a period of decreased revenue caused by the advertiser pauses and think of ways the company could bring in more money.
"I would say be as fiscally responsible as possible," the chief executive told her workers. "And that's on a spectrum of critical-only and necessary travel to being a good steward of anything that might be related to an expenditure at the company."

Happy Thanksgiving, Hermit Billionaires!: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Gail Collins: Bret, I guess we should start with things we're thankful for this year. Don't suppose the imminent end of the political career of the dreadful Representative George Santos rises to the level of holiday cheer.
So you go first. No fair counting family and friends.
Bret Stephens: It's a depressing world, Gail, so we need to find cheer wherever we can, and the House Ethics Committee report on Santos does make for delightful reading. My favorite bit: "During the 2020 campaign, a $ 1,500 purchase on the campaign debit card was made at Mirza Aesthetics; this expense was not reported to the F.E.C. and was noted as 'Botox' in expense spreadsheets." Santos would have been around 32 years old at the time.
Gail: You're right. Makes me cheery just hearing it.
Bret: On a loftier plane, I was delighted to see Joe Biden describe Xi Jinping as, well, "a dictator" of a "Communist country" while Antony Blinken, his secretary of state, visibly winced. That was another wonderful moment.
Gail: I can see how Biden felt a little cornered when a reporter asked him if he still believed Xi was a dictator. I mean, what was he supposed to say? "No, I think he's changed a lot"?
But it also does seem as if it's the kind of question he should have been a tad better prepared to handle.
Feel free to perk me up again.
Bret: I loved Biden's answer. It reminded me of Ronald Reagan calling the Soviet Union an "evil empire," to the consternation of diplomats and pundits but to the relief of anyone who liked hearing an American president state the obvious and essential truth. I also think it's worth celebrating the fact that inflation seems to have been tamed without cratering the rest of the economy in the process. That might not help Biden's campaign, since a lot of price increases are now baked into the system, but at least things aren't getting worse.
OK, now your turn.
Gail: Hey, this is a president who has really kept the economy under control, who has a great program for building new roads, bridges and mass transit and who always keeps climate change in mind when he's working out an agenda.
And who does not seek out cheap headlines by saying things that are both wrong and wrongheaded just to get attention.
Bret: Like Elon Musk?
Gail: OK, never been grateful for Elon Musk. He has, however, made me more appreciative of stupendously rich people who don't get involved in public debates. Happy Thanksgiving, hermit billionaires!
Bret: He's also made me more appreciative of normal billionaires who, unlike him, don't promote crackpot antisemitic conspiracy theories on their social media platforms. I'm also appreciative of companies -- like IBM, Paramount, Apple and Disney -- that have pulled their advertising dollars from X, formerly known as Twitter, out of disgust for his views. Now I'm rooting for Tesla owners to trade in their Model 3s for a Rivian or any other electric car that doesn't run on a high-voltage blend of bottomless narcissism, knee-jerk bigotry and probably too much weed.
Gail: Well said. Moving back to politics: I'm grateful that some Republican presidential candidates other than He Who Shall Not Be Named are getting some attention. Particularly your fave, Nikki Haley.
On that topic, tell me what you think about the primaries. Donald Trump is way ahead nationally, but do you think Haley could do something impressive in the early primaries? If, say, Chris Christie dropped out and endorsed her?
Bret: My gut tells me that primary voters prefer a contest to a coronation, but then my brain remembers that the G.O.P. has turned into a cult. As the field narrows, Haley will pick up Christie voters and maybe some DeSantis voters, too. But Trump will pick up other DeSantis voters, plus Ramaswamy's.
I'm about as thankful for Trump's dominance as I would be for a terminal cancer diagnosis. But hey, aren't we trying to keep things optimistic?
Gail: Maybe it's my desperation that creates these imagined scenarios in which Haley impresses New Hampshire voters, who are always up for a script in which they get to pick the new star. And then the campaign gets a real jolt when Christie drops out and gives her his endorsement.
Bret: I like this fantasy. Say more.
Gail: Then Haley starts a serious campaign that draws terrific interest among rich Americans who don't want a president who has to spend half his time in court trying to prove that he didn't actually try to fix the last election, that his real estate empire isn't just a fairyland of debt, that -- I could go on. If Haley could get the serious-alternative attention and funding, it'd be quite a ride.
And oh, did I mention that I'd be thankful if she rethinks her position on a six-week abortion ban bill?
Bret: Gail, I bet this is the first time you wish the 1 percent were more like the majority, at least in terms of attitudes about Republican candidates. If Park Avenue got to decide the G.O.P. primary contest, Haley would be the nominee in a heartbeat.
And speaking of heartbeats: Biden turns 81 this week. Happy birthday, Mr. President. May you live to 100, but please, please, please retire. We'll all pitch in to buy you a new Corvette, at least before we have to take away the keys.
Gail: Sigh. Once again, I'm gonna have to follow up my praise of Biden in office with a plea for him to leave it. If you're in good health like he is, your 80s can be a great time of achievement. Or your 90s -- look at Jimmy Carter and all his charitable work and Rosalynn Carter, who just died at 96. But that doesn't mean it's a good time to be president of the United States.
If our president really wants to make me thankful this season, he knows what he can do.
Bret: Let's face it: There's just not a lot to be thankful for, politically speaking. So, um, read any good books lately?
Gail: Well, right now I'm on "Romney," the Mitt biography by McKay Coppins, although Romney himself was so wildly cooperative it feels as if he should get some kind of co-author status. So far, it's a very good read.
And I just finished our colleague Adam Nagourney's book "The Times," which is about ... well, us. Adam's a friend and a terrific reporter. Bet anyone who's a devoted Times reader will gobble it up.
Finally, I sort of have a thing for presidential biographies, and if anybody's looking for a really fine one, I'd recommend "Washington," by Ron Chernow. Always good to start at the beginning.
How about you?
Bret: Generally, I hate books about the media by the media: Solipsism is one of the curses of our profession. But everyone who has read Adam's book tells me it's terrific, and I've promised myself to get to it before the year's out.
I'm making my way through two books right now, one to feed the mind and the other the soul. The first is the Johns Hopkins scholar Yascha Mounk's "The Identity Trap," an intellectual tour de force about the origins of identity politics and the threat it presents to genuine, honest, old-fashioned liberalism. The second is "My Effin' Life," by the greatest living Canadian: the singer and bassist Geddy Lee of the band Rush. It's a story about how an improbable trio of geeks from Ontario rose to the pinnacle of rock 'n' roll stardom while somehow holding on to their wits, souls and marriages.
I'm sure you can't wait to read it. I'm guessing you'd rather talk about budget negotiations.
Gail: Well, one ongoing story line that's driving me crazy is the House Republicans' insistence that pretty much everything be tied to a cut in the I.R.S. budget.
Now I know it's natural for people to hate tax collectors. But the idea that you make the country more stable by making it easier for folks to conceal income and illicitly expand deductions is beyond me.
Bret: Hope it won't surprise you to learn that while I'm all for lowering taxes majorly, I'm also for collecting them fully. The Republican war on the I.R.S. isn't pro-growth; it's just anti-government.
As for the big picture: We can't go on like this, from one short-term spending bill to another, one budget crisis to another, one House speaker to another. This is banana republic governance -- and by "banana," I mean "bananas." Pramila Jayapal, the progressive congresswoman from Seattle with whom I agree roughly once every 500 years, was right when she said, "It's the same menu, different waiter."
Gail: In a normal -- thinking non-Trump -- era, the Republicans would have taken over the House by a more substantial margin. Usually happens when one party gets the presidency, as you know. Voters get nervous and want to put up some barricades against extremely partisan behavior.
But this time the Republicans won by only a hair, in part because there were a number of awful Trump-promoted Republican candidates.
So you've got a House run by a deeply inexperienced leader with a tiny majority. And everything bad that happens is going to be the Republicans' fault.
Except, I guess, if Biden's dog Commander comes back to the White House and bites more people.
Hey, before we go, happy Thanksgiving, Bret. Very grateful for the chance to converse with you every week.
Bret: And to you!

A Composer Explores Other Worlds: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Irish composer blends everyday items with Dada-like theatricals. But there's a serious purpose to her explorations.
A few weeks ago, Jennifer Walshe was backstage at a concert hall in Essen, Germany, searching for the exit when she paused near the green room. A double bass bow was laid out, ready for the evening's performance; attached to it, wobbling in the air, were several black-and-white balloons. Walshe grinned and pulled out her phone to snap a picture.
This esoteric musical apparatus had been prepared for a new piece, composed by Walshe, that would be premiering in a few hours' time. Called "Some Notes on Martian Sonic Aesthetics, 2034-51," it invites a chamber ensemble to impersonate a musically trained crew who have set up a colony on Mars and are beaming performances back to Earth.
While researching the piece, Walshe, 49, said that she had asked NASA how sound waves travel in carbon-dioxide rich atmospheres ("you don't hear high-end frequencies"). She had also requested that packets of freeze-dried food be placed on the percussionists' tables, so that the audience could hear the sound of astronauts chowing down, along with cans of compressed air to imitate the hiss of airlocks opening and closing.
And the helium-filled balloons? Here to make the double bassist's bow feel 60 percent lighter, as though he were playing in Martian gravity. "I'm a hardcore science fiction fan," Walshe said as she strode onto the street. "I want things to be as accurate as possible."
Otherworldly though the Mars piece may be, by the standards of Walshe's oeuvre, it isn't that outlandish. In 2003, she produced a 35-minute opera, "XXX Live Nude Girls," whose protagonists were Barbie dolls manipulated by puppeteers, their voices supplied by female vocalists. In 2017 came "My Dog & I," a piece for cello, dancer, film, electronics -- and the cellist's pet, who curled up onstage.
A few years later, Walshe began work on a knowing tribute to her homeland called "Ireland: A Dataset," in part created by feeding gobbets of "Riverdance," Enya, James Joyce and Irish sean nos folk song into an artificial-intelligence-generated composition engine. In the piece, which Walshe described as "a slightly bizarre radio play," the results play out alongside video mash-ups and an instrumentalist and vocalists performing skits, one of which pokes fun at Irish American tourists visiting the country in search of their roots.
It would be wrong to think of these pieces as jokes, but not entirely wrong: a vein of anarchic humor does run through much of what Walshe does, as well as a taste for hectic, Dada-like theatricals. She often appears as a vocalist in her own pieces, makes accompanying films and writes scripts and essays, in addition to her day job as a professor of composition at the University of Oxford.
"It's hard to keep up with her," said Kate Molleson, a critic and broadcaster. "Her mind is so restless and inquisitive. I can't think of a composer more interested in the way the contemporary world functions."
Walshe said she sees what she does as a way of paying attention: "I want to be present, and curious and engaged," she said over dinner one night. "The work is how I do that."
Born in Dublin to a working-class, artistically inclined family (her father worked for IBM, her mother was a writer), Walshe began as a trumpeter -- initially in local youth orchestras, before studying the instrument at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.
At college, she said, she felt like the odd one out: She would practice and attend concerts, and work on her own compositions, but she was also fascinated by visual art, literature, film and a million other things. These obsessions were "regarded as my weird hobby," she said with a laugh.
She felt more at home when she did graduate work at Northwestern in Chicago, discovering not just avant-garde composer-performers like La Monte Young and Laurie Anderson, but also the city's rambunctious comedy and free jazz scenes. Despite never having taken vocal training, she began to sing and improvise, and the boundaries of her creativity exploded.
It is Walshe's creed that practically everything can be material: text messages, memes, irritating conversations overheard on the train, old TV shows and movies unearthed from YouTube, online message boards, Samuel Beckett and the band One Direction have all appeared in her work.
The other week, she said, she had been asked to record her dentist as he performed a procedure: "The second you say, 'Let's pay attention to this and see what's going on,' maybe that's something interesting."
But it would be wrong to interpret her work, extraordinary as it often is, as irreverent for the sake of it, Molleson said. "There's a real compassion and tenderness there. And she's fascinated by big issues. Take A.I., which she was exploring a decade ago: She was way ahead of most of us." For all of its high jinks, in performance "Some Notes on Martian Sonic Aesthetics" was a disconcertingly moving meditation on the loneliness of space exploration.
Later this month, Walshe will travel to the northern English town of Huddersfield, where she will be the resident composer at its annual contemporary music festival. "Ireland: A Dataset," premiered online during the coronavirus pandemic, will have its first in-person performance on Nov. 24. And a gallery will host an exhibition of Walshe's work, titled "13 Ways of Looking at A.I.: Art and Music," which will develop the composer's recent thinking on a subject that has preoccupied and fascinated her for the last decade, and which increasingly seems to infiltrate her output.
The festival will open on Friday with another recent work, "Personhood," created with the accordionist Andreas Borregaard. It explores what selfhood looks like in an era of unremitting technological surveillance -- with many of our movements tracked, and much of our data scraped and mined.
According to Walshe, Borregaard and the ensemble are instructed to perform choreography as if being controlled by a "mind cult." The conductor will be equipped with the kind of clicker used by dog trainers, and there will be references to characters resembling Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
A rumination on how it feels to cling to individuality when tech corporations seem intent on trying to turn people into biological fodder for algorithms, "Personhood" is both funny and deeply serious, like so much of Walshe's work.
"Perhaps it sounds earnest, but the way I think of my role as an artist is to try and look at the world around me, and process that," Walshe said. "It's how I understand what's going on."

Berating Musk, Yet Also Keeping SpaceX Close: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rarely has the U.S. government so depended on the technology provided by a single technologist with views that it has so publicly declared repugnant.
The White House denounced Elon Musk on Friday for "abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate," for his endorsement of what an administration spokesman called a "hideous lie" about Jews.
All of which might make one think the Biden administration was going to try to pull back from doing business with the world's richest person. Except that, in recent weeks, the U.S. government has become more dependent on him than ever, agreeing to as much as $ 1.2 billion worth of SpaceX launches next year to put crucial Pentagon assets, including spy and command-and-control satellites, into space.
And in September, the Pentagon agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars for "Starshield," a new, secure communications system his company has set up for the nation's defense and intelligence systems, relying on the same clusters of Starlink satellites that have proved vital to Ukraine's military during the war with Russia.
In private, administration officials say the Starlink satellites are critical to deterring China because they are far more resistant to Chinese efforts to disable them than the Pentagon's own communications satellites.
These are only the latest examples of why the federal government has no viable way to break up with Mr. Musk, at least as long as the United States decides it is going to continue space exploration and deter its biggest superpower rivals. It may denounce him and declare that all Americans should reject his views. But it needs him, or at least his rockets and his satellites, more than ever.
And the White House and Pentagon both know that.
Rarely has the U.S. government so depended on the technology provided by a single, if petulant, technologist with views that it has so publicly declared repugnant. And yet, by the account of administration officials, they have no choice -- and will not for a while. Because there are, right now, few viable alternatives.
It is an unusual predicament. If a top executive of one of the traditional publicly held defense contractors -- Raytheon or Boeing or Lockheed Martin -- had embraced an antisemitic conspiracy theory the way Mr. Musk did, there would be pressure from shareholders and customers alike for a resignation. In fact, advertisers like IBM and Apple and Warner Bros. Discovery have been announcing in recent days that they will pause doing business on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr. Musk, rather than apologize, has threatened lawsuits.
But SpaceX is privately held, entirely controlled by Mr. Musk. (Tesla, his electric vehicle company, is publicly held.) And so far, while the White House has been outspoken, the Pentagon has been silent.
"It would be good to have alternatives, and the U.S. government has tried to develop some," Walter Isaacson, Mr. Musk's biographer, said in an interview on Sunday. "But no other company," he said, including United Launch Alliance, a Boeing and Lockheed Martin venture, has "been able to make reusable rockets, or get astronauts into orbit, or get some of these heavy satellites into high-Earth orbit."
In fact, ever since the invasion of Ukraine, the military dependency on Mr. Musk has only increased. It was Mr. Musk's decision to ship Starlink satellite equipment to Ukraine in the hours after the invasion that kept the country able to communicate, and ultimately to target Russian assets. Similarly, when Mr. Musk declined a Ukrainian request to extend the coverage of the system to Crimea, the Ukrainians found that they could not precisely aim drones on a mission to attack Russian ships.
Later, Mr. Musk and Gen. Mark A. Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, worked out a deal for Starshield, the Pentagon system that will be based on Starlink, the world's largest satellite constellation. But the Pentagon will control the new system, so that where it can operate is not dependent on a single executive's whims.
NASA is also working with Mr. Musk, in separate contracts collectively worth at least $ 4 billion, to land two sets of its astronauts on the moon with SpaceX's new Starship rocket, bringing humans back to the lunar surface for the first time in more than 50 years. SpaceX is also the primary way the United States supplies the International Space Station and new crews.
During the second quarter of this year, SpaceX alone sent nearly 80 percent of world's payload by mass into space, according to an analysis by one industry consultant, Bryce Tech.
That 472,000 pounds of cargo carried by SpaceX in that time is more than five times as much as Russia and China collectively lifted off Earth into orbit and nearly 40 times as much as the closest competitor in the United States, United Launch Alliance.
It is a level of dominance unlike just about any industry sector in the world. And it is far more consequential, in terms of market share, than Tesla's role in the electric vehicle market.
Mr. Musk, Pentagon officials said, has brought real benefit to the Defense Department and the commercial space industry worldwide.
"They did pretty dramatically lower our cost to orbit," Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in an interview with The Times last month.
But Pentagon officials, including Mr. Kendall, said they are working to try to expand their choices in terms of space launch, both for smaller commercial loads and the most expensive and sensitive national security launches. They soon will be taking bids from new providers to try to make the United States less reliant on any one launch provider, as it is now.
The vast market share of SpaceX comes at a moment when the demand for access to space has expanded at a historic rate, given the rapid advances in low-Earth orbit surveillance and communications technology, and an intensifying contest with China over possible military use of space.
The Pentagon has decided it wants in the coming years to launch thousands of smaller, cheaper satellites into low-Earth orbit. The goal is to better defend against a possible effort by China to disable communications by knocking out the relatively small numbers of traditional, much larger and more expensive satellites the Defense Department has in space.
"Imagine," Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said in a speech earlier this year, "systems on orbit, flung into space scores at a time, numbering so many that it becomes impossible to eliminate or degrade them all."
In short, more reliance likely on SpaceX.
The United States' commercial space launch industry also is largely addicted to SpaceX, at least for now.
Competing launch companies, including Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, Europe's Arianespace and other new space industry entrants such as Rocket Lab, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace, do not yet have their own new medium launch rocket systems ready to go.
Even the major military contractors, Boeing and Lockheed, are years behind schedule with their new heavy-launch rocket, Vulcan, though it is expected to have its first test before the end of this year.
For now, this means there is a major shortage of available launch capacity -- and SpaceX is just about the only company in the Western world that has a large amount of room to sell, be it to the Pentagon or private-sector customers.
"They aren't quite a monopoly," said Chris Daehnick, a former senior official at Air Force Space Command who is now a space-industry consultant at McKinsey. "But in the near term, if you have to get the space, there's one way to do it right now, unless you already have a contract, and that is SpaceX."
This level of dominance has already brought expressions of concern from some members of Congress and investigators at the Senate Armed Services Committee, who are examining SpaceX's commanding role in providing the military access to space and space-based communications.
"Serious national security liability issues have been exposed," Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in a statement in September, after it was first disclosed that SpaceX had limited Ukraine's ability to use its Starlink system at one point during the war.
"Neither Elon Musk, nor any private citizen," he said, "can have the last word when it comes to U.S. national security."

Researchers Lament Data On War Posts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People who study social media say the conflict between Israel and Hamas has underscored the need for better data transparency from platforms.
As the Israel-Hamas war flooded social media with violent content, false information and a seemingly limitless swell of opinions, lawmakers and users have accused platforms like TikTok and Facebook of promoting biased posts.
Tech giants have denied the charges. TikTok, accused of elevating pro-Palestinian content, blamed "unsound analysis" of hashtag data. Some Instagram and Facebook users circulated a petition accusing the platforms' parent company, Meta, of censoring pro-Palestinian posts, which Meta attributed to a technical bug.
Antisemitic content swarmed onto X, the platform formerly known as Twitter and run by the billionaire Elon Musk. X's chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, said in a post on Thursday about antisemitism that "there's no place for it anywhere in the world."
Where the truth lies, however, is hard to glean, according to academic researchers and advocacy groups. They said the debates over content related to the Israel-Hamas war have highlighted the roadblocks complicating independent analysis of what appears on the major online services. Instead of being able to conduct methodical studies of online discourse, they must try to grasp its scope and effects using inefficient and incomplete methods.
The murkiness enables people to make dubious claims about what is dominant or popular online and allows the platforms to retort with similarly flimsy or warped evidence, limiting accountability on all sides, the researchers said.
"We're in desperate need of rigorous, informed research on what the actual impact of platforms are on society, and we can't do that if we don't have access to data," said Megan A. Brown, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan who researches the online information ecosystem.
Inflammatory content -- and what to do about it -- remained top of mind at social media platforms this week. More than a dozen Jewish TikTok creators and celebrities, including the actors Sacha Baron Cohen and Debra Messing, confronted TikTok executives and employees in a private meeting about the platform's handling of antisemitism and harassment. After Mr. Musk endorsed an antisemitic post on X, internal messages showed that IBM cut off $ 1 million in planned advertising spending.
Researchers also tried to understand a surge of interest in a decades-old letter from Osama bin Laden. The so-called "Letter to America" criticized the United States and its support of Israel, repeating antisemitic tropes and condemning the destruction of Palestinian homes.
After reviewing public social media posts from Tuesday to Thursday, researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue concluded that references to the letter jumped more than 1,800 percent on X. They found 41 "Letter to America" videos with more than 6.9 million views on TikTok.
The researchers, Isabelle Frances-Wright and Moustafa Ayad, said in an interview that they wanted to do much more sophisticated analysis. Instead, they had to run searches by hand using basic terms, unable to analyze the letter's spread by region or language.
"Much of this content, particularly video content, is not tagged with the type of text we can manually search, so anything we're finding is really just the tip of the iceberg," Ms. Frances-Wright said.
Jamie Favazza, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said that the company supported independent research, and that it allowed over 130 academic research teams access to analyze the site. "We're working diligently to expand eligibility to civil society researchers in the U.S. soon," she said.
Meta declined to comment. X did not respond to a request for comment.
Background data about engagement, volume and other metrics is usually retrieved through a platform's application programming interface, or A.P.I. The major tech companies have long offered some degree of access, but researchers said that now seems to be shrinking.
This year, as Mr. Musk sought to find new ways to monetize X, the company started charging thousands of dollars for monthly access to its A.P.I., effectively shutting out many researchers. Meta's support for the data analysis tool CrowdTangle has dwindled amid internal concerns about damaging the company's reputation.
These days, researchers said, the data they can study is often dictated by what platforms want to release -- "research by permission," some explained -- and is often unreliable and delayed long past the point of relevance.
"With data, you can always paint the picture that you want when you are the only one who has access to that data," said Sukrit Venkatagiri, an assistant computer science professor and misinformation expert at Swarthmore College. "If we have no lens into what is happening in these spaces that have billions of users, that is a little scary."
TikTok has been at the center of the recent firestorm, partly because of its ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance, with some critics claiming that it is pushing pro-Palestinian content to align with the government in Beijing. TikTok has been accused of amplifying pro-Palestinian videos through its powerful algorithmic feed and of failing to address antisemitic content.
TikTok has issued multiple statements pushing back on accusations of bias, pointing to polls showing that young Americans supported the Palestinian cause before the company existed. The company has also tried to poke holes in data about popular hashtags that critics said revealed the pro-Palestinian bent on the service.
This week, TikTok said that the hashtag #standwithIsrael had fewer videos than #FreePalestine, but "68 percent more views per video in the U.S., which means more people are seeing the content." It also pointed to public data on Instagram and Facebook, which showed millions of #FreePalestine posts and fewer than 300,000 #standwithisrael posts.
Researchers like Mr. Venkatagiri said such data lacked context: "You have to look at the whole information environment, at every single variant of that hashtag, whether it's being used in support or against a particular topic, what other text is being used, if it's just a tweet or in a video, comments, links," he said. "There's so much more you have to think about beyond just looking at this one-off analysis."
Tech giants have said that they are trying to balance the interests of researchers with users' privacy rights, while also ensuring the data is not used for commercial purposes.
"It's not that there shouldn't be guardrails placed around researchers, but when those guardrails are placed by the companies themselves, it introduces challenges to what kind of research gets done and by whom," Ms. Brown said.
The Anti-Defamation League has talked with TikTok for more than a year about advocacy groups' getting access to its A.P.I., but the war has highlighted its urgency, said Yaël Eisenstat, a vice president at the Jewish advocacy group.
It is "prohibitively difficult" to independently determine whether TikTok is promoting content that favors Israel or Palestinians or analyze its management of antisemitic content, she said.
As of this year, academic researchers from nonprofit universities in the United States and Europe can apply for free access to TikTok's research A.P.I. with a defined research proposal, subject to a two- to three-week approval process. (Approval processes are common across the platforms.) The company said that it has already received proposals to study content related to the Israel-Hamas war.
The Digital Services Act, a new European Union law, now requires large online platforms to provide real-time data to researchers studying the risks of social media, and has pushed companies like Meta and YouTube to offer new tools for researchers. Similar requirements are being proposed in the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act in the United States.
Meta, which has faced criticism over flawed data and tussled in 2021 with a New York University research group, updated researchers' ability to work with its content archive (the company noted this summer that queries of its library take place in "controlled-access environments" that do not allow researchers to download data). YouTube, after years of pressure from groups like the Mozilla Foundation, is also opening up to independent research.
Susan Benesch, who runs Dangerous Speech Project, a research group, hopes to study content emerging from the Gaza conflict but, for now, is mostly relying on anecdotal evidence from acquaintances working in trust and safety at social media platforms.
She knows that the companies, hoping to avoid public criticism, don't have an incentive to release data to researchers. Transparency could, however, be "a huge opportunity" for society, she said.
"There's a gold mine with all of these different veins of invaluable information hidden in there that no researchers in the course of human history could have even dreamed about until now," Ms. Benesch said. "The platforms still won't give it to us, but now at least it's there."

More Companies Stop Ad Buys on X as Musk Fallout Grows: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Warner Bros. and Sony have joined other companies in pausing spending on X, formerly Twitter, over Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic post.
More major advertisers have paused their spending on X, the social media service formerly known as Twitter, as the backlash continued over Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X.
The entertainment company Warner Bros. and Sony have joined other prominent brands in halting their spending on X. IBM cut off its advertising on X on Thursday, while Apple, Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS, all paused their ads on Friday.
The spending freeze comes as X has fought to win back advertisers who were wary of spending on the platform after Mr. Musk took it over a year ago and said he would loosen content moderation rules. Major brands tend to be cautious about placing their ads next to posts with offensive or hateful speech.
Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter in October 2022 and renamed it X, drew scrutiny this week after replying to a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the "exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them" and supporting the immigration of "hordes of minorities."
"You have said the actual truth," Mr. Musk replied. Jewish groups said that Mr. Musk's message boosted a conspiracy theory known as replacement theory, which claims that Jews have organized nonwhite immigrants to replace the white race. The concept was embraced by Robert Bowers, who killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.
Mr. Musk's statement drew condemnation from the White House on Friday. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was "unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust."
Mr. Musk lashed out at advertisers who had pulled their dollars from X on Friday, and threatened legal action against Media Matters, a left-wing advocacy organization that said it found antisemitic content on X and highlighted advertisements for Apple, IBM and other brands that appeared alongside posts touting Hitler and the Nazi Party.
In a post on Friday night, Mr. Musk said, "The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company."
X said that the research strategy used by Media Matters to discover the advertisements that ran along antisemitic content was not representative of how regular people use its platform. The organization followed accounts that posted the content, then refreshed the X timeline until ads appeared, X said in a blog post. Only one of the nine posts highlighted by Media Matters violated its content moderation rules, X added.
In a statement, Joe Benarroch, the head of business operations at X, said, "50 impressions served against the content in the article, out of 5.5 billion served the whole day, points to the fact of how efficiently our model avoids content for advertisers." He added, "Data wins over allegations."
Media Matters said that it would defend itself from litigation by X. "Far from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully threatening a meritless lawsuit in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate," said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters. "Musk admitted the ads at issue ran alongside the pro-Nazi content we identified. This is like getting mad at a mirror because you don't like the reflection. If he does sue us, we will win."

Full text: Disney, Apple, Paramount and Lionsgate halted marketing on X, formerly Twitter, as Elon Musk faced a furor over antisemitic abuse on his social media platform.
The blowback over Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X gathered steam on Friday, as several major advertisers on his social media platform cut off their spending after his comments.
Disney said it was pausing spending on X, as did Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS. Apple, which spends tens of millions of dollars a year on X, also suspended advertising on the platform, a person with knowledge of the situation said. They followed IBM, which cut its spending with X on Thursday.
Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter last year and renamed it X, has been under scrutiny for months for allowing and even stoking antisemitic abuse on the site. That snowballed on Wednesday when the tech billionaire agreed with a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the "exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them" and supporting the immigration of "hordes of minorities."
"You have said the actual truth," Mr. Musk replied.
Jewish groups have compared the statement in the original post to a belief known as replacement theory, a conspiracy theory that posits that nonwhite immigrants, organized by Jews, intend to replace the white race. That idea fueled Robert Bowers, who raged against Jewish people online before killing 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.
On Friday, the White House condemned Mr. Musk, 52, for boosting the anti-Jewish conspiracy theory. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was "unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust."
An X spokesman declined to comment on the advertising pauses, and Apple didn't respond. Axios reported earlier on Apple's decision, and Bloomberg reported earlier on the Lionsgate suspension.
Linda Yaccarino, X's chief executive, posted on the site on Thursday that the company had been "extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination." But on Friday, Mr. Musk agreed with a post on X that suggested advertisers like IBM were pulling back from the platform to save face.
He later said accounts that made "clear calls for extreme violence" would be suspended, highlighting two phrases associated with Palestinian supporters that would not be tolerated on the site.
Advertisers have been skittish about X since Mr. Musk bought the social media service last fall and said he wanted more free speech and would loosen content moderation rules. That meant the platform could theoretically place brands' ads next to posts with offensive or hateful speech.
Many companies, including General Motors and Volkswagen, have balked at various points over the past year at having their promotions appear alongside a heavily documented surge in hate speech, misinformation and foreign propaganda on X. In April, Mr. Musk said nearly all advertisers had returned, without indicating whether they were spending at the same levels; he later noted that ad revenue had fallen 50 percent.
Mr. Musk also swung from threatening any advertisers that dared to pause their spending with a "thermonuclear name & shame" to wooing them by choosing Ms. Yaccarino, a former top ad executive at NBCUniversal, to replace him as chief executive. He picked public fights with major spenders like Apple and churned through sales executives given the task of maintaining relationships in the advertising industry. Top advertising companies, such as IPG, urged their clients to step back from X.
Advertising had long been about 90 percent of Twitter's revenue before Mr. Musk bought the company. Last month, X told employees that the company was valued at $ 19 billion. That was down from the $ 44 billion that Mr. Musk paid.
The heightened sensitivity around antisemitism, Mr. Musk's penchant for public squabbling and general fatigue after months of fuss over X left many advertising professionals hesitant to weigh in on Friday.
"Clients have always had to make decisions about content they will or will not be associated with," Renee Miller, the founder of the Miller Group advertising agency in Los Angeles, said in an email. "We generally counsel our clients to not take an openly public political stand."
IBM, which cut off about $ 1 million in advertising spending that it had committed to X for the rest of the year, said on Thursday that it had "zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination." The tech company acted after a report this week from Media Matters for America, a left-wing advocacy group, which said ads from companies including Apple and IBM were appearing on X next to posts supporting white nationalism and Nazism.
Mr. Musk posted late Thursday that "Media Matters is an evil organization."
Angelo Carusone, president and chief executive of Media Matters, said Mr. Musk's "calling us evil" for pointing out what was on X was "not dissimilar from any right-wing account who we highlight."
He added that X was "not just going to just lose money with Apple, but also the cornerstone of their strategy to woo back advertisers."

Members Of U.A.W. Back Deals With Big 3: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union hopes the agreements with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis will help it make inroads at other companies.
Members of the United Automobile Workers union have given their backing to new contracts with the three big U.S. automakers, agreements that deliver hefty wage increases and other gains that had eluded the union for more than 20 years.
In the most closely contested vote, the tentative contract agreement at General Motors won the support of 55 percent of the nearly 36,000 members casting ballots, according to a tally from all the G.M. locals that the union posted on Thursday.
Tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Chrysler, appeared headed for approval by more decisive margins, nearly complete results there showed.
A spokesman for the union confirmed the accuracy of the tallies but declined to comment further.
The agreements are similar across the three automakers and raise the top wage for production workers 25 percent, to more than $ 40 over four and a half years, from $ 32. They were reached last month after a six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the companies -- a strategy spearheaded by the union's new president, Shawn Fain, who had vowed to take a more adversarial approach to negotiations than his predecessors.
The agreements appear to have quickly reverberated across the auto industry, with Toyota, Hyundai and Honda announcing significant wage increase at nonunion plants in the United States only days later.
"We call that the U.A.W. bump, and that stands for 'U Are Welcome,"' Mr. Fain said in testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week. "And we're very proud of that. And when these workers decide to organize and join the U.A.W., they're going to realize the full benefit of union membership and get what they're fully due."
The new contracts also included larger company contributions to workers' retirement plans and the right to strike over plant closures. All three automakers declined to comment on the ratification votes.
Mr. Fain said the union was seeking to capitalize on its momentum by waging muscular organizing campaigns at nonunion plants, and, in remarks submitted to the Senate committee, he added that thousands of workers were already contacting the union and signing union cards.
But even Mr. Fain's tough approach in the talks with the Big Three did not yield terms attractive enough to many union members. G.M. workers at several large plants voted against the tentative agreement by large margins.
In contrast, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters recently approved a new contract at United Parcel Service with 86 percent support, while a new contract between the Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios passed with 99 percent support.
Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University, said Mr. Fain had achieved a major victory despite having taken office only a few months earlier with a goal of reorienting the union.
Dr. Givan said the union's approach of initially striking at one plant at each of the three automakers and ramping up over time had "really upended a lot of conventional wisdom" in the labor movement and had proved unusually successful at reversing some concessions that the union had accepted years earlier, like the suspension of a cost-of-living adjustment.
"This shows that if workers build enough power, they can win things back," she said.
U.A.W. members at Mack Truck also ratified a contract on Wednesday, after rejecting an initial agreement with the company.
Across the three automakers, skepticism toward the agreements arose in large part from veteran workers who felt that the proposed contracts did not go far enough to compensate them for years of concessions and weak wage growth, even given strong gains for newer workers. Wages for some newer workers will more than double over the next four years.
Huey Harris, a G.M. employee at a large truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., who has worked at the company for over 20 years, said the deal should have gone further in rewarding veteran workers, though he ultimately voted for it. "The traditional people didn't think they were offered enough in the contract," he said.
Several longtime employees of the Big Three automakers said that even after the large gains of the new contract, they would not be making more than when they started their careers.
Curtis March, who works at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, said he made about $ 18 an hour once he reached the top wage for production workers at the company in the early 1990s, equivalent to more than $ 40 today when adjusted for inflation. He will make about $ 36 in the first year of the new contract.
Mr. March said the deal was likely to pass at Ford because it placated more recent employees, who outnumber veterans like him. Workers at his plant approved the deal after voting against several previous contracts.
Despite the ultimate success, the path to ratifying the contracts has included some internal strains for Mr. Fain and the union. Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group that played a key role in electing Mr. Fain and six other members of the U.A.W. executive board to their positions, declined to formally recommend that union members approve the contract even after Mr. Fain urged the group to do so at a recent meeting, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Instead, Unite All Workers passed a resolution committing it to stay neutral during the ratification vote, though it stated that the group "celebrates the record gains made in this agreement."
Two of these people also said the union's General Motors department had been less communicative and less proactive in distributing information about the contract to local union officials and members than the Ford and Stellantis departments.
The union declined to comment on these developments.
Ratification could also bring political benefits to President Biden, who waded into the negotiations over the summer and fall, and who risked angering business leaders by increasingly siding with the union's members.
Administration officials were taken aback in August when Mr. Fain called for a 40 percent raise for autoworkers and a four-day workweek. Executives at the Big Three called the White House to ask if Mr. Fain was serious. A senior administration official said Biden aides had reassured them that the union wanted a deal, but acknowledged that the negotiations could go quite differently from the way the automakers were used to.
In mid-September, when Mr. Biden was in New York for meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, he joined aides on a video call to make a decision that he and his team had been building toward for weeks: to join autoworkers on a picket line in Detroit. That decision infuriated executives, the administration official said, but the White House saw it as a victory for the president and for workers, by making a clear statement about where Mr. Biden stood in the negotiations.
Some autoworkers argued that the union had erred by failing to expand the strike, which eventually included about one-third of the companies' unionized workers in the United States, even more.
LaDonna Newman, another longtime Ford worker who opposed the contract because of its limited gains for veteran workers, said she believed the union could have won more at the bargaining table had it been willing to escalate further.
Still, she did not blame Mr. Fain for the outcome. "He walked into a burning building," Ms. Newman said. "I give him a lot of kudos for having the courage to go against the corporations."

Full text: Many longstanding General Motors workers have been voting against the tentative accord, which they feel insufficiently improves retirement benefits.
A United Automobile Workers union vote on a tentative contract agreement with General Motors that provides record wage increases has run into unexpectedly strong resistance from veteran workers.
Voting at most union locals has been completed and the final result, due as early as Thursday evening, will very likely be decided by a narrow margin. A majority of workers at several large plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the contract, though union members at a large sport utility plant in Arlington, Texas, voted in favor of it.
G.M., Ford Motor and Stellantis agreed to similar contracts with the union after U.A.W. members went on strike at select plants and warehouses. Workers walked off the job at the first three plants on Sept. 15 and stayed on strike for more than 40 days. It was the first time the union has struck all three automakers at the same time, though it did not shut down all of the factories of any company.
The agreement appears to be headed for ratification at Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram vehicles, by comfortable margins, according to running tallies the U.A.W. published online.
At G.M., many veteran workers have opposed the contract because they want the company to contribute more money to retirement plans and the cost of health care for retirees.
"I've heard from some traditional workers who said there wasn't enough in there for them," said David Green, director of the U.A.W. Region 2B, which includes Ohio, Indiana and a small part of Michigan. He voted for the contract.
David Miller, a 20-year G.M. veteran who works at a big truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., said the absence of retiree health benefits was the reason he had voted no. "I'm not voting yes on any contract that doesn't have that in it because I don't need the health care when I'm 25 -- I'm 65," he said. "I'm at the mercy of Medicare."
General Motors declined to comment on the contract vote.
The tentative contract raises the top wage by 25 percent, from $ 32 to more than $ 40 over four and a half years. The increase is more than the combined wage increases the union has won over the past 22 years, according to U.A.W. officials.
Newer hires who are lower on the pay scale will see larger increases that take them to the new top wage. And workers who were recently hired will see their hourly pay double.
The agreement also provides for cost-of-living adjustments that will nudge wages higher if inflation persists as well as enhanced company contributions to pensions and retirement plans, more paid time off and the ability to strike if any plant is closed during the term of the contract.
To be ratified, the agreement must secure a simple majority. More than 46,000 U.A.W. workers work at G.M., although not all of them are likely to turn in ballots. More than 14,000 company employees took part in the targeted strikes.
As of Wednesday afternoon, an online vote tally that the union maintains showed that just over 54 percent of the votes were in favor of the contract, but that tally did not include numbers from some big plants.
If the tentative agreement is voted down, it will represent a big setback for the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, who was elected this year and promised to take a more aggressive approach in the contract talks in hopes of winning significant pay increases and reversing some of the concessions the union accepted in past contracts.
He appeared to deliver that in what was widely regarded as a record deal. President Biden, who joined striking workers on the picket line in September at a G.M. site in Belleville, Mich., hailed Mr. Fain's efforts. The president joined Mr. Fain last week at a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis agreed to keep open after halting production this year.
"I don't think it diminishes Shawn Fain's luster that much because of a close ratification vote," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means expectations were high, and had he not delivered as much as he did, it wouldn't have passed."
After the contracts with the three Detroit automakers are ratified, Mr. Fain hopes to try to organize workers at nonunion plants in the South owned by Toyota, Honda and other foreign automakers, and the nonunion plants that Tesla operates in California and Texas.
Since the terms of the U.A.W. agreements were announced, some of those companies have increased wages of factory workers. Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates by 9 percent in January. Honda and Hyundai will lift wages 11 percent and 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
"Everybody at those companies should say, 'Thank you, U.A.W.,"' Mr. Wheaton said. "Those increases wouldn't have happened without the new U.A.W. contract."

Full text: The story of death at a mogul's retreat (no, not "Glass Onion") has a few interesting ideas about tech within a familiar mystery scenario.
An eccentric tech billionaire invites a slew of notables to a private retreat, where a detective must solve a mysterious death. If the premise of "A Murder at the End of the World" jumps out at you, it may be because you not so long ago encountered it as the premise of Rian Johnson's "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery."
Or it may jump out at you because "Murder" is the latest creation from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij of Netflix's "The OA." That series was a poetic and baffling testament to the force of human connection, involving interpretive dance and a telepathic octopus. The murder mystery, in comparison, is among the most literal, plot-reliant of genres. Could Marling and Batmanglij really have made something that ... ordinary?
FX's "Murder," which begins Tuesday on Hulu, is neither as weird as you might hope or as conventional as you might fear. (Or vice versa.) It takes an Agatha Christie scenario and spins it into a chilly, stylized cyber-noir with ideas about artificial intelligence and some familiar Marling/Batmanglij themes of global consciousness. Think of it as "Glass OAnion."
The detective here is a relative newcomer. Darby Hart (Emma Corrin), an intense young computer hacker, tracked down a serial killer with Bill Farrah (Harris Dickinson), a moody amateur investigator she met online and fell in love with. Her true-crime memoir earns her some literary notice, as well as an invitation from Andy Ronson (Clive Owen), a tech magnate who is convening a meeting of "original thinkers" -- artists, entrepreneurs, an astronaut -- at a sleek, remote hotel that he had built in Iceland.
The purpose of this Arctic TED Talk is, ostensibly, to cogitate on the existential threat of climate change to humanity. Andy, however, has another intelligence at his disposal -- an advanced A.I. called "Ray" that manifests in the holographic form of a neatly goateed man in black (Edoardo Ballerini). Andy believes in the transformative power of this technology and others, but transformative to and for whom?
Darby questions whether and why she fits in with the luminaries at the gathering. But she accepts the invitation for the chance to meet a tech idol: Not Andy, but his wife, Lee Andersen (Marling), a renowned coder who dropped out of public life after a Gamergate-style harassment campaign and lives in seclusion with Andy and their young son (Kellan Tetlow).
But another guest grabs Darby's attention: Bill, now a famous artist, whom she has not seen since a falling-out at the end of their investigation. Before they have time to catch up -- don't say the title didn't warn you -- somebody turns up dead, and Darby's wiring for suspicion kicks in.
Misogyny and technology are the twin themes of "A Murder." Darby was drawn into the serial-killer case by her talent for hacking and her empathy for forgotten female victims. A common theme of her investigations is how little credibility she is granted as a young woman. When she pulls her hoodie over her head, yes, it is a universal visual symbol for "hacker," but she also might as well be drawing an invisibility cloak.
Then there's A.I., which pervades the story like it does Andy's icy retreat. In some cases technological reality has moved faster than the TV production process. A scene in which Ray produces a Harry Potter story in the voice of Ernest Hemingway astonishes the guests, for instance, but you've likely seen a dozen similar examples over the past year.
Still, "A Murder" has a multifaceted view of A.I., not just as a threat but as a possible helpmeet. On the one hand, Andy is another arrogant billionaire who looks to software to compensate for the deficiencies that annoy him in humans. But the surveillance features built into the retreat's setting, however creepy, are also a trove of clues. As Darby digs into the mysterious death, she finds herself using Ray as a source and even an aide -- part Sherlock Holmes's Watson, part IBM's.
The present-day whodunit isn't especially inventive, but Corrin carries the story with a nervy, febrile performance that invests Darby with the life that the dialogue sometimes fails to provide. And the series has atmosphere to spare, making the most of the stark volcanic beauty of its location in Iceland. (It also shot in Utah and New Jersey.)
The flashbacks to Darby and Bill's serial-killer chase, which take up much of the seven episodes, are emotional and involving; Dickinson gives Bill an open-wound vulnerability. But rather than adding resonance to the whole, these scenes end up outshining the long, talky story they're meant to flesh out.
"A Murder," in its main arc, feels like a bit of an artificial life form itself. The blandly drawn retreat guests get no more than a stroke or two of characterization and are weighted with self-serious dialogue. Andy mostly plays to bullying tech-mogul type. And while Marling always uses her enigmatic air as a performer to good advantage, Lee is more of a riddle -- how did a coding revolutionary become a tech tradwife? -- than a rounded character.
Marling and Batmanglij's work has often been more about the delivery of ideas and intangibles than plotting or naturalism, however. At its best, "A Murder" has grandeur, chilly beauty and intellectual adventurousness (and it pulls off a satisfying final twist). It might have been more effective if, as with so many limited series lately, it were tighter and shorter. In this sense, technology is the culprit: Streaming-TV bloat has its fingerprints all over this case.

After U.A.W.'s Agreement, More Carmakers Raise Pay
South Korean automaker Hyundai has joined Honda and Toyota in raising factory wages after the United Auto Workers reached new contract deals with Detroit automakers.
Hyundai said Monday it will raise factory worker pay 25 percent by 2028, matching the general wage increase won by the U.A.W. Toyota raised factory pay 9 percent to 10 percent starting in January, while Honda said it will increase wages 11 percent during the same period.
Labor experts say the increases are at least in part aimed at thwarting U.A.W. President Shawn Fain's strategy of trying to organize U.S. auto plants run by foreign automakers and Tesla. Mr. Fain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, and he called Toyota's pay increase the U.A.W. bump.
"U.A.W., that stands for 'You Are Welcome,"' he said.

Emirates Plans to Buy
$ 52 Billion of Boeing Jets
Long-haul carrier Emirates opened the Dubai Air Show on Monday with a $ 52 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft, showing how aviation has bounced back after the groundings of the coronavirus pandemic, even as Israel's war with Hamas clouds regional security.
Its low-cost sister airline, FlyDubai, followed up with an $ 11 billion order of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, the first wide-body aircraft in its fleet. Together, the sales marked a significant win for Virginia-based Boeing on the first day of the air show, as airlines appear poised for even more billion-dollar deals this year.
Emirates C.E.O. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the carrier would purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s.
Emirates will also add five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30, Sheikh Saeed said.

Continental Plans to Cut Thousands of Workers
The German car parts manufacturer Continental said on Monday that it would cut thousands of jobs in its automotive division worldwide as part of a plan to save 400 million euros ( $ 428 million) a year from 2025.
The exact number of job cuts was not immediately clear, but it will amount to the "mid-four-digit range," the company said.
The news comes amid ongoing reports that Continental plans a restructuring and potential sell-offs, with its C.E.O., Nikolai Setzer, saying in September he was considering a change in ownership of the company's ContiTech division.
The works council of the automotive division urged the company in an internal statement seen by Reuters to rule out outright dismissals and use all possible measures to keep its work force on, from part-time retirement for older workers to retraining and reallocating staff.

Full text: I GREW UP in India with all the major world religions. I attended a Christian boarding school in a Hindu-majority country that is roughly tied with Pakistan for the second-largest Muslim population in the world. My mother's family were Sikhs, and I counted among my closest friends a Jew from Bombay and Buddhists from Tibet. Pilgrimage is common to all of these faiths, even as it is utterly distinctive. In Islam, the pilgrimage to Mecca is an ordained pillar of faith that the Prophet Muhammad performed himself. In Christianity, the culture of cherishing relics and visiting holy places is said to have begun with Saint Helena -- the mother of Constantine I, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity in 312 -- rushing off to the Holy Land in search of the True Cross. Some pilgrimages enshrine sorrow, like the Ashura in Iraq, which would be the last stop on my journey; others, like fiesta in Bolivia's Copacabana, are pilgrimages of joy and rapture. Some are historical, like the Jewish commemoration of exile; others, like the Mecca pilgrimage, represent the repurposing of an older sanctity, in this case that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Some pilgrimages focus on a single day, others a season, a month, an auspicious alignment of the stars. In India, which has some of the greatest scenes of pilgrimage anywhere in the world, such as the Kumbh Mela, where every 12 years the largest gathering of humanity on earth -- more than 100 million -- comes together at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, I had also witnessed the touching intimacy of a family or group of friends who set out for a holy place on a Sunday, just as someone might go fishing or to a national park in the United States.
It was the ordinariness of this latter kind of pilgrimage, away from the grand spectacles of Ashura and fiesta, that I had hoped to capture in Buddhist Mongolia. I had imagined springtime pilgrimages, people visiting monasteries as the weather warmed. If La Paz is the highest capital in the world, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest, with January temperatures reaching minus 30 degrees. In fact, even as I was setting out at the end of May, my guide and translator, Orgilbaatar Tsolmon, who goes by Orgil, was sending me videos of snow showers in the Mongolian capital.
My flight from New York connected through Istanbul; the first leg was 10 hours, and from there we flew another eight hours in a level line across the face of Asia. The Black Sea gave way to the Caspian and, beyond, to a land of mountain, desert and steppe. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his descendants, poured over the steppe in the 13th century and, in the words of the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon, "the caliphs fell, and the Caesars trembled on their throne," even as representatives of the major faiths -- from Islam and Nestorian Christianity to Taoism and myriad forms of Buddhism -- would come before the great khans to make their case for why their particular creed ought to be the official religion of the empire.
My first glimpse of Mongolia was of rolling hills draped in thin emerald grass, of cloud shadows the size of lakes and of raking beams of morning light breaking through a heavy sky. "Nomadism," I scribbled in my notebook in a sleepless haze, "captures the very spiritual heart of pilgrimage, which is to wander." If the Latin peregrinus gives us "pilgrim," it also gives us "peregrination."
Orgil was waiting for me at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar with a red Nissan SUV. My first thought on seeing him, with his long hair and light beard, was of the Nepalese artist Araniko's late 13th-century rendering of Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson. "In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure-dome decree. ..." The Coleridge poem was the first I had committed to memory as a child, during a blackout in Delhi, but Kublai was more than the figment of an opium dream. He was a full historical personage who founded the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) in China and established Beijing (then known as Dadu) as its capital, and was the man whose conversion to Buddhism around 1258 brought shamanic Mongolia into the orbit of Tibetan Buddhism.
The influence of Buddhism grew sporadically for almost seven centuries in Mongolia, merging in profound ways with its ancient worship of nature -- of mountains, water, the eternal blue sky. But then, in the early decades of the 20th century, Buddhism encountered a mortal enemy: Soviet-backed Communism. Even by the standards of a tumultuous century, the Stalin-directed purges of the late 1930s stood out for their systematic eradication of Mongolia's religious culture. The great majority of the country's monastic institutions were leveled to the ground; some 18,000 monks were killed; and, in a society where about one-third of the adult male population were lamas (though not all living in monasteries), Buddhism was ripped out root and branch.
In 1990, with the fall of Communism, religious freedom was established in Mongolia and Buddhism was allowed to be practiced again. My first destination was the Khamar monastery, 300 miles south in the Gobi Desert, which had been all but destroyed in 1938. It was said to be situated at one of the portals to Shambhala -- a mythical kingdom of peace and tranquillity in the Buddhist imagining -- and had been founded in the century before by an artist, saint and sybarite called Danzanravjaa, known as the lama of the Gobi. Bolivia had given me new respect for the survival of the sacred, despite great political and historical upheavals, and I was curious to see what pilgrimage would look like in a place where it had been stamped out for generations -- curious to see the old pilgrim routes leading back to the locus of sanctity, like neural pathways reforming around an area of trauma.
MONGOLIA, BROADLY SPEAKING, is a country with half the landmass of India and a population smaller than that of Los Angeles proper -- some 3.3 million people -- of which about half live in Ulaanbaatar alone. As we left the capital's new Japanese-built airport armed with supplies of chips, Snickers, Coke Zeros and vodka as offerings, I gained a first impression of an unnerving emptiness. After some initial settlements of white yurts, or gers, as they're known here, and houses with brightly colored corrugated roofs behind dark wooden stockades, all signs of habitation fell away. On that morning in late May, spectral wisps of snow blew over the long two-lane highway, and the wind was so strong that I found it difficult to put my jacket on outside the car.
Amid what seemed like trackless wastes there periodically appeared the giant ragged form of an ovoo, or cairn. Its beanpole of a body was bandaged in blue khadags (prayer scarves), its stony mound of a base littered with vodka bottles and the occasional skull of a dead animal. The ovoo is a monument to the spirits of the natural world, known here as nagas and savdags. Orgil, following the custom of honoring these easily offended beings, lest they punish you for your neglect, honked three times as we went by. "This is the Gen Z way," he said, grinning, "but I prefer the old way," which involves circling the ovoo on foot three times in a clockwise motion.
But it was too cold to stop. It was too cold to smoke, too cold to take a pee. The temperature was only in the low 30s, but the wind bit through me, and it was hard to believe that this was a relatively mild spring day by Mongolian standards. Outside Choir, a dust-bitten town halfway to the monastery, we inhaled a lunch of mutton broth and dumplings, fried rice and a meat-stuffed pastry called a khuushuur. Then we drove on, another four hours. The land turned arid and flat. Double-humped Bactrian camels appeared along the side of the road. An enticing band of opalescent sky offered the relief of a horizon after hours of rain and snow.
Orgil, in between telling me of his days in a metal band, when "I drank beers left and right," would occasionally grow serious. "During Communism," he said, "we lost our national identity." The purges of the 1930s plundered the country's monasteries and temples -- there had been some 700 in the 19th century -- which Orgil described as repositories of folklore, history, traditional medicine and learning. Mongolia, after winning independence from Qing China in 1911, began those early decades of the 20th century as a feudal theocracy with a godlike figure, akin to the Dalai Lama, called the Bogd Khan at its helm, overseeing around 80,000 monks. (The Dalai Lama recently introduced a Mongolian child as the 10th reincarnation of the Bogd.) "They shot all the head lamas," Orgil said. "They murdered all the teachers." The fires from the monasteries were rumored to have burned for weeks. Christopher Kaplonski, a social anthropologist who has conducted research in Mongolia, has written that, though the total number of Mongolians killed between 1937 and 1939 is unknown, "credible estimates range from 35,000 to 45,000."
As evening fell, we arrived at the ger camp on the edge of the Gobi, a short drive from the Khamar monastery. We were the only ones there. Orgil had made me worried that there would be no pilgrims at all. Bolivia was a lesson in the imperishability of the sacred, but it had also shown me how places of pilgrimage, like the sacred crag on the Island of the Sun, could die. If you ban a religion for more than half a century, murder its clergy and raze its monasteries, as the Communists had in Mongolia, then maybe you do deal it a death blow?
I was full of dark thoughts when the ger camp began magically to fill. I'd just finished a dinner of banshtai tsai, dumplings in a goat milk and tea broth, and retired to my ger, where I was watching the wood-burning stove cast shadows on the wooden lattice and felt walls, when I heard electronic music blaring into the Gobi. I stepped outside to see the neat rows of gers now brightly lit, noise and chatter pouring out of their doorways. Bottles of soda were being ferried back and forth and mixed with vodka. Prim, lightly made-up girls sat on the edges of what looked like the Mongolian equivalent of a frat party. "Who are these people?" I asked Orgil in amazement. "Pilgrims," he answered. Some were part of a construction company, others students with exams on the horizon. They had come to draw energy from Shambhala. The rites the next morning were to begin before dawn, yet the pilgrim parties, with their Chaucerian feeling of intimacy among strangers, continued raucously into the night.
Just before daybreak, at 4:20 a.m., we joined a cavalcade of SUVs off-roading through the desert, drawing ruby red parabolas over the dunes. Our first stop was a fertility shrine near the monastery. On a hill were two mounds of sand and rock with stone finials, connected by a beam that was wrapped in the blue prayer cloths. Women in puffer jackets with cartons of milk went back and forth between the shrine and the edge of the hill, casting their offerings of milk into the air. Orgil told me that no man could perform the rite unless his mother had died in the past 49 days, in which case he could perform it on behalf of her spirit.
The sun rose over the Gobi, showing reddish earth and black-edged dunes. The sky was a cold, motionless blue. While the women performed the ritual, I spoke to a group of men in their late 30s and early 40s who worked for a real estate company in Ulaanbaatar. One was an economist, another a lawyer, a third a businessman. They had arrived by train from the capital. "I came here to recharge my energy and cleanse my spirit," said Egi, the economist. (Mongolians use patronymics rather than Western-style surnames; in conversation, people often go by just one name.) "This place is a world energy center." When I asked if the ritual had been handed down to him by his parents, he said, "They knew about it, but they were not authorized to come. We are the lucky generation." He added: "This Shambhala reminds us that we are not just ordinary nomads. We had an enlightened one [Danzanravjaa] live among us." Since the transition to the democratic era, Egi said, "Mongolian people have come to know that we have a great religious and cultural heritage."
Munkhdul, the businessman, said in halting English, "It's a reconnection in modern times to the past of our life." Some moments later, our band of pilgrims (about 50 to 100) reconvened outside the gateway to the Shambhala complex, where a pair of mesmeric half-closed eyes, painted on a wall of pinkish orange, gazed out at us, symbolizing the inward-turned sagacity of the Buddha. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in a rectangular enclosure of red earth marked out by a perimeter of white stupas. It was like being in a Zen garden, where one proceeded from one station to another, performing a series of rituals and rites under an open sky. In the distance, the level sands of the Gobi fell away as far as the eye could see. It was an austere, heart-stopping glimpse of the void.
Our guide, Haidav, was from the Gobi region. In his early 30s now, he had been selected as a boy by Gandantegchinlen (often referred to simply as Gandan), the country's main monastery in Ulaanbaatar, to spend four years in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where, at a center of Tibetan Buddhism -- the Namdroling monastery, popularly known as the Golden Temple -- he had been educated in the religion of his forefathers with the express aim of reintroducing it to Mongolia. As he led us into the Shambhala, he seemed less like a guide than like a monk re-educating his countrymen about a faith whose core precepts, such as the belief in karma and reincarnation, had survived the ravages of Communism, but whose rituals had to be relearned from scratch. Our group was composed almost entirely of Mongolians, but no one knew what to do at the various stations any more than I did.
At the genie's belly, a low mound of dark rocks, Haidav told us to exhale all of our sins and bad thoughts, intentional and unintentional. At the site of Danzanravjaa's ger, which was just a circle in the sand, we offered handfuls of grain. We wished that "with the help of the enlightened one, we would be reborn into the Shambhala." Then we went to three other circles representing past, present and future. Haidav told us to walk not through but around them. We had open bottles of vodka in our hands and made offerings into the air. (Milk and vodka! It was a combination I would encounter time and again in this nomadic post-Soviet society.) Haidav told us not to wish for money or material things but only that which was regenerative -- a child, rain or power. He placed a special emphasis on looking in, on harmony and balance. He said that all the bad things that happen to us, whether ill health or failure in our careers, were emanations of what was within and, in cleansing the inner sphere, we could succeed in the outer.
If pilgrimage is exteriorized mysticism, a way for human beings to grasp spiritual truths, the Shambhala felt almost like a cosmogram or mandala, a metaphysical scheme writ small. We came to a circle of red rocks that was the energy heart of the whole enclosure. Here, we sat down. Some lay on the rocks and rolled from side to side. The aim was to draw in the energy of the place. I talked to Samdanbazar, a 78-year-old herder from Töv Province, in the environs of Ulaanbaatar. She wore a gold-and-purple deel, a long coat of sorts, fur lined in the winter, with tiny earrings, her dyed hair whitening at the roots. Watching her roll back and forth, taking such obvious pleasure in the rite, I couldn't help but ask what it had been like to be denied all of this for the first 45 years of her life. "We had to hide everything," she said. "My father was a lama, so we had to hide our thangkas [Tibetan Buddhist cloth paintings], Buddhas and religious artifacts."
Our last station was the Golden Skull Hill, where a central ovoo overlooked the desert beyond. There we chanted, "Um sain amgalan boltugai" -- "may there be peace with you" -- and sang "Ulemjiin Chanar" ("Perfect Qualities"), a Mongolian folk song that Danzanravjaa had composed himself. Haidav was almost scolding in the care with which he instructed us to sing as a chorus. "Whatever your failures," he said at the end of our morning at the Shambhala, "it's because of your mind."
THE EMPHASIS ON interiority, on isolating the self as the site for spiritual advancement and failure, felt very different from the Christian pilgrimage in Bolivia. The focus there had been outward: on Mary, her miracles, on what she could give you. Here, almost everyone spoke of enlightenment from within and of certain corrosive human emotions, anger being among the gravest of them, that would impede that progress. In Mongolia, the texture of sin felt less like a crime against God than against oneself. Three symbols are often associated with Danzanravjaa's life and thought: a female figure representing his love of pleasure; a swan symbolizing the arts; and, lastly, a scorpion signifying the human potential for self-destructiveness. Outside our ger camp, there was a giant metal sculpture of a black scorpion, its tail raised, surrounded by desert sands on all sides. It stood as a reminder of the cardinal sin in the Buddhist scheme: rage, which, like the myth of the scorpion, makes us our own worst enemies, liable to sting ourselves in the head.
Kublai Khan may have laid the foundation for the rise of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, but it was a man called Zanabazar -- a monk, scholar and artist -- who solidified its position. In everything from scripture to ritual, temple design and even religious fashion, including monastic robes with blue cuffs evoking the blue sky that Genghis Khan claimed to worship, the hand of Zanabazar is visible.
At the Erdene Zuu monastery, founded by Zanabazar's great-grandfather in the 16th century after the declaration of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion of Mongolia, I witnessed an amazing scene, proof of the cocktail of motives that puts us on the road to pilgrimage. Erdene Zuu, with its green-tiled roofs in the Chinese style, is Mongolia's oldest monastery, built in 1586. It is also located near the ruins of the Mongol capital at Karakorum, about 530 miles from Khamar monastery. On entering Erdene Zuu's vast, grassy complex, with its perimeter wall crenelated with white stupas and nothing but big sky on all sides, I felt the spirit of a Mongolian camp. Nomadism harbors a disdain for materiality, yet it was hard not to feel myself on consecrated ground, even if only in historical terms. It was mainly from here that the descendants of Genghis Khan in the 13th century brought the world to its knees, from present-day Ukraine to Korea. The site had more recent memories, too. Of its 62 temples and some 500 facilities, the vast majority had been destroyed during the ravages of the 1930s. All around me, amid a handful of stupas and temples, were the flattened foundations of buildings in the religious complex. There had been 1,500 lamas here in the 19th century; there were fewer than 50 today. At the entrance, I spoke briefly to Mandakhtsog Monkhbaatar, who was in his early 20s, dressed in orange-and-red robes with those huge turquoise cuffs and high boots with blue piping. Like Haidav, he had spent years studying at the Golden Temple monastery in India, relearning the traditions that Communism had left Mongolian Buddhism too depleted to teach. Monkhbaatar's great-grandfather had been a prominent lama in the southwestern province of Bayankhongor. When I asked the young monk about him, he said casually, "He was murdered," then rushed into the great complex, where the morning chants were set to begin.
A plump child lama in a plumed yellow cap appeared on the wooden watchtower of a temple whose sloping white facade evoked the Potala in Lhasa, Tibet -- the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas. A conch shell sounded three times. Knots of pilgrims and tourists milling about outside drew near. Inside, monks sat chanting on wooden benches in a blue-ceilinged room hung with thangkas. Sutras wrapped in yellow silk rotated on a turnstile. As bells and chanting reached a crescendo, amid clouds of incense, a woman in a black-and-copper deel, her schoolteacher's face tremulous with ardor, came rushing in. She then began to perform full-bodied prostrations in the aisle between the monks, some chanting, others laughing or charging their phones. Again and again, as the tempo rose around her, this thin, bespectacled woman prostrated herself in ecstasy, doing what is known in Sanskrit as ashtanga pranam, or the eight-body-part salute: hands, feet, knees, chest and chin. Watching her, I was reminded of a pilgrim I had once seen at a shrine in central India. He had looked like a bureaucrat or bank clerk, the ordinariness of his appearance only amplifying the extraordinariness of his actions. I'd watched him take a rock and place it on the floor a few feet away and then lie flat on the ground face down and wriggle his way toward it. He'd repeated the same gesture several times until he circled the shrine. "This," the young Brahmin whom I'd been traveling with said to me, "is bhava" (a kind of rapture). Later, I learned that the woman at Erdene Zuu was a 40-year-old herder from Inner Mongolia, the region of the country that had remained part of China after present-day (Outer) Mongolia won its independence in 1911. She told me that she'd been a devout Buddhist since she was a child. "It's the most perfect religion because it enlightens from within," she said. But it wasn't just Buddha who had brought her to Erdene Zuu. She said she came for Genghis Khan, too. "He was our ancestor," she said of the founder of the Mongol Empire -- who was not Buddhist but shamanic. "I wanted to receive the particular energy of this man here, in what was the capital of the Mongol Empire and of Buddhism."
"So is this a religious pilgrimage for you, or a nationalistic one?" I asked.
"It is both," she said. "For Mongolians, this is a sacred place. This is ancestral land." When I asked her if she felt Chinese at all, she said, "I'm 100 percent Mongol, even if I live in the part that's China. We may live in different locations, but that doesn't change the fact that we're all Mongols."
When I asked for her contact details, she demurred, explaining that to share them was unsafe. Then, as I was walking away, she came rushing after me, imploring me not to post the pictures we had taken together on any social media or mention her by name in whatever I wrote. It was a reminder that political peril had always been part of the calculus of pilgrimage, whether in the Middle Ages, when Islam's conquest of the Holy Land gave rise to local shrines, such as Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury, or now, for this pilgrimage-within-a-pilgrimage of a Mongolian herder, honoring her ethnic and spiritual ancestor, irrespective of any national boundary.
Growing up in India, I witnessed the intersection of religion and nationalism canalized into a militarized form of pilgrimage. In 1990, the Hindu nationalist leader L.K. Advani led a rath yatra, or "chariot pilgrimage," from Somnath temple in the western state of Gujarat, where a major Hindu temple saw the first of many assaults upon it in the 11th century. The yatra, steeped in historical pain and revenge, was headed for the city of Ayodhya, a thousand miles away in Uttar Pradesh, where a 16th-century mosque -- named after the Emperor Babur, who, incidentally, was a descendant of Genghis Khan and the founder of the Mughal (derived from Mongol) dynasty -- stood on the alleged site of what was the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The yatra was stopped before it got to Ayodhya, and Advani arrested, but the rage he had tapped into was not so easily contained. Two years later, on Dec. 6, 1992, a mob of kar sevaks, or religious volunteers, some coming as pilgrims with bricks for the construction of a new temple, destroyed the mosque. Religious riots ensued, and hundreds died. Ayodhya was the crucible that led to the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India. Two decades on, it gave rise to the majoritarian politics of Narendra Modi. Pilgrimage offered a release from the monotony of daily life, but it also galvanized people in the service of faith, often at the expense of other faiths, and over such a wholesale recruitment of people sent away from home full of religious zeal there forever hung the specter of a crusade.
ORGIL AND I drove some 1,500 miles in five days, off-roading over what felt like the spine of Asia: valleys of spring flowers with ancient burial sites encircled by gently creased hills of green velvet. Orgil let me drive. The full expanse of the steppe, streaked with islands of shadow, opened up around us. Sometimes the sky would darken and a storm would roll in, turning the furrowed hills a morose green; then a herd of semi-wild, rain-drenched horses might assemble at the center of the road. I had never seen such emptiness. I felt myself in a country where animals outnumbered people many times over. It was as exhilarating as it was disquieting -- the solitary sight of a ger in the distance, the cattle-covered crest of a hill dotted black, beige and white, as if the fickle hand of nature had taken up pointillism. It was easy to imagine this changeless landscape as one where people were especially attuned to the spirits of the natural world. "Throughout Mongolia it is believed," Orgil said, "that if you pollute the water, the savdag will be angry at you, so we don't even pour milk into the water, which we consider to be the purest thing." That shamanic worship had fertilized Mongolian Buddhism, giving it its distinct character, which in turn, because of the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, already included certain esoteric teachings, practices and rituals, known in classical India as the Tantras.
I hardly saw Ulaanbaatar until the end of my time in Mongolia. The location of the capital once known to Mongols as Khuree, meaning "monastery," and later to the Russians as Urga, had not been fixed until the late 1700s and, even today, the city of nearly 1.7 million has the air of a giant encampment. A suburban sprawl of ger neighborhoods -- ramshackle houses and yurts -- surround a Soviet-style city center of decaying apartment blocks and bureaucratic behemoths touched up with blue glass and steel.
Here, the Gandan monastery, the de facto Vatican of Mongolian Buddhism, was the only such institution allowed to remain partially open during Communism. Although it was closed during the purges of the late 1930s, Munkhbaatar Batchuluun, 45, a jovial lama who handled communications for the monastery, explained that it owed its survival to a cynical act of tokenism. Henry Wallace, Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice president at the time, was in Mongolia on a fact-finding mission in 1944, and the Communist government wanted to show that some modicum of religious freedom existed in Mongolia. Thus the Gandan, though hollowed out, was permitted to stay open as a Potemkin monastery. Mongolia had come as close as any society to having eradicated a religious way of life, with deep roots in the social fabric, yet here, too, as so often on this pilgrimage of mine, the sacred had triumphed in the end. The newly built main hall of the Gandan was swarming once more with pilgrims and lamas. The recitation of the sacred Ganjuur sutra -- a practice that had been repressed in Mongolia for decades, the renewal of which I was there to witness -- was underway. Sitting in the coffee shop downstairs, in a building that was a teeming complex of ATMs, broadcast studios and what Munkhbaatar referred to as "donation receiving desks," akin to cashiers at a bank, for the performance of various religious services, he described Buddhism as never really lost "but preserved in the minds of people."
As a boy in the countryside in the 1980s, he recalled his grandfather -- a lama who disrobed after the execution of his teacher -- performing Buddhist rites under cover of darkness at an altar he kept hidden in his home behind a curtain. The other villagers, who praised Communist ideals of progress by day, would by night call on his grandfather, the disrobed lama, to perform healing rites. The Buddha outlined three freedoms, Munkhbaatar explained, of behavior, speech and mind: "The Communists controlled the first two, but they could not control our minds," he said.
On my penultimate night in Ulaanbaatar, I went to meet a woman named Gerelmaa, who went by Giimaa for short, for a shamanic ceremony. She lived in a ger neighborhood in a small house, with a yard full of rubble and rotting armchairs. A white Hyundai sat on cinder blocks, framed against the setting sun. Giimaa, a stout chain smoker in her 60s with a single upper tooth, had been an East German-trained electrical engineer under Communism before becoming a shaman in 1991. She'd often travel up to 5,000 miles a year on pilgrimages to Uvs Province in the west of the country to draw energy from the place where one of her ancestors, a powerful shaman in his day, had once lived. As we sat in an upstairs room full of taxidermy birds of prey, she told me that she mostly uses her shamanic powers to help people cure illnesses and dispel dark energy.
Giimaa donned her heavy reindeer-skin coat, hung with a bear's foot, a vulture's claw, a wolf's paw and brightly colored tassels. She made offerings of milk and vodka, which her spirit, like those of most people in Mongolia, seemed to relish. With a veil over her face and feathers on her head, she began to beat a pentagonal drum, dancing about the small room.
Once the spirit took hold, Giimaa slumped down on the floor and began to speak in the gravelly voice of her male ancestor. She had told me not to be scared, but it was scary. The spirit asked about my life, and I gave him the salient details: I was the love child of a Pakistani politician and an Indian journalist. My father had been assassinated by his own bodyguard. I was married to a man from Tennessee and had been unable to return to India to see my family since 2019, when Modi's government had stripped me of my overseas citizenship only months after I wrote an article critical of his re-election.
The spirit saw darkness in my life. He asked me to envision my home in the United States and, touching me, flew there to dispel that dark energy. My mind zoomed up, too, giving me an aerial view of this scene of a shamanic ceremony in a little house with the sun setting over the hills surrounding Ulaanbaatar. I thought of my fellow pilgrims: Eduardo Quintela, and his quiet tribute to his father; Aracely Alcón, full of gratitude for Santiago's restored mobility; and the woman at Erdene Zuu on her perilous journey.
Pilgrimage in that moment seemed less to me like exteriorized mysticism and more a rite of remembrance. The world would have us forget what is painful. It would have us move on and be free of the past; but both as individuals and societies, we have our loyalties to what we have known and endured. Pilgrimage gave us the illusion of a forward movement across space, even as it allowed an inner journey toward communion with our past. It was a crystallization of the poet Joseph Brodsky's idea that "if there is any substitute for love, it's memory."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: First as a correspondent and later as a professor, he pushed his industry to adopt more rigorous, quantitative methods.
Philip Meyer, a former reporter who pioneered new ways to incorporate data, quantitative methods and computers into investigative journalism, died on Saturday at his home in Carrboro, N.C., a suburb of Chapel Hill. He was 93.
His daughter Melissa Meyer said the cause was complications of Parkinson's disease.
With a career spanning the latter half of the 20th century and several years into the 21st, Mr. Meyer was at the center of a revolution within the craft and business of journalism -- a revolution that, to a large degree, he helped shape.
When he began working as an assistant editor at The Topeka Daily Capital in Kansas in the mid-1950s, computers were room-size, turtle-speed contraptions, and reporting was done mostly through interviews, with the occasional trip to the library or the government records office.
Mr. Meyer was among the few reporters who saw the growing power of computers to crunch data and produce new insight into complex questions.
His breakthrough came in 1967, in the aftermath of the Detroit riot that summer. Mr. Meyer, by then a national correspondent for The Akron Beacon Journal in Ohio, had spent the previous year at Harvard on a Nieman fellowship for journalists, intending to study how pollsters used computers to manipulate data.
Instead, he realized the possibility of using computers in his own work. He took courses, learned code and even devoted time to using an IBM mainframe computer.
He went to The Detroit Free Press, which, like The Beacon Journal, was a Knight-Ridder paper, as a favor to the editor, who said that his own reporters were exhausted and he needed fresh bodies.
Mr. Meyer immediately seized on a claim, common in the news media, that the rioters had mostly been poor, uneducated Black migrants from the South. He gathered as much demographic data as he could, ran it through a computer and got a much different picture: The rioters were more likely to be locally born, and were spread evenly across the socioeconomic spectrum.
A year later, Mr. Meyer shared in the Pulitzer Prize for local general or spot news reporting, which went to The Detroit Free Press for its coverage of the riot.
That work earned Mr. Meyer national recognition as the leading thinker on bringing social-science methods into reporting. He summed up his approach in his book "Precision Journalism: A Reporter's Introduction to Social Science Methods," published in 1973 and today considered one of the most important books about reporting ever written.
"They are raising the ante on what it takes to be a journalist," he wrote in his first chapter. Today, he said, "a reporter has to be a database manager, a data processor and a data analyst."
Not everyone agreed. In the early 1970s, Mr. Meyer consulted with two investigative reporters at The Philadelphia Inquirer, Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, for a seven-part series analyzing whether judges were too lenient on violent offenders.
Many politicians said yes. But the trio, using a program Mr. Meyer wrote for a mainframe rented from a Maryland defense contractor, showed that the answer was conclusively no.
The series, "Crime and Injustice," won several awards. But it was shut out from the Pulitzers, Mr. Steele said he was later told, by jurors who insisted that their work was not journalism.
"There was a lot of built-up resistance to something like that," Mr. Steele said in a phone interview. "That didn't seem like it was traditional reporting."
That opposition weakened over time, as computers became central to daily life and reporters became comfortable with using data in a rigorous fashion, not as a replacement for traditional methods but as a supplement -- a change instigated and guided by Mr. Meyer.
"One of the things that I think Phil did so well was help us eliminate the idea that there is a tension between narrative and deep, deep on-the-ground reporting and more disciplined -- what he would call precision -- journalism," Sarah Cohen, a journalism professor at Arizona State University, said by phone. "That they can stand side by side and in the same pieces, and that each can be made stronger by the other."
Philip Edward Meyer was born on Oct. 27, 1930, in Deshler, a small town in southeastern Nebraska, and grew up in and around Clay Center, Kan., across the border. His father, Elmer, owned a hardware store, and his mother, Hilda (Morrison) Meyer, was a teacher and grocery-store cashier.
Philip learned to cover issues in science and technology at Kansas State University and graduated in 1952 with a degree in technical journalism. He then spent two years in the Navy as a public-information officer.
He returned to Kansas in 1954 to work as an editor at The Topeka Daily Capital. He married Sue Quail, a fellow staff member at the paper, in 1956. She died in 2021.
Along with his daughter Melissa, Mr. Meyer is survived by two other daughters, Kathy Lucente and Sarah Meyer; a brother, John; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Caroline Meyer, died in 2020.
Mr. Meyer received a master's degree in political science from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1958. He and his family then moved to Miami, where he worked as an education reporter for The Miami Herald.
Four years later he became a Washington correspondent for The Akron Beacon Journal. He served as a national correspondent and director of news research for Knight-Ridder before joining the journalism faculty at Chapel Hill in 1981. He retired in 2008.
As a professor, he wrote widely on journalism ethics and the newspaper business. His book "The Vanishing Newspaper: Saving Journalism in the Information Age" (2004) predicted that the steady decline of newspapers would continue unless they found a new way to engage with audiences -- a prediction that has been largely borne out.
He was equally prescient about the ways in which changes in the economic model of journalism shifted the boundaries around conversations about objectivity -- a change he welcomed.
"As the audience fragments, trust is still important," he wrote in USA Today in 2004. "But it should be based on getting the facts right, not on the pseudo-objectivity that comes from a journalist concealing his or her views."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden's signature climate law has stimulated a surge of investment in electric vehicle production across the country, including tens of billions of dollars on battery plants across the South and new assembly lines near the Great Lakes. Based on early evidence, it is succeeding at a goal that economists have long considered difficult and costly: using the power of government to rapidly grow a new industry.
That growth could prove crucial for the other side of the electric vehicle equation: enticing more consumers to buy them. That's because Mr. Biden's law effectively hitches the future affordability of electric vehicles to automakers' willingness to source and build them in the United States.
For now, the climate law has not drastically affected trends in electric vehicle sales. Americans are poised to buy one million electric cars and trucks for the first time this year, continuing a steady trend of increased market share for electric vehicles that began years ago.
The law's most pronounced immediate effect on the consumer market appears to be unintended: driving many electric car shoppers to lease vehicles instead of buying them. That's because a Treasury Department regulation enables auto dealers to avoid the law's made-in-America requirements for cars that they buy and then lease to customers. That allows shoppers to effectively reap the full benefits of the federal tax break for models that otherwise would not qualify.
Still, analysts say, electric vehicle sales are projected to jump sharply under the right conditions. Automakers would need to continue to invest in battery and assembly plants. Administration officials must speed the deployment of charging stations meant to ease the logistics of owning and driving an electric vehicle.
Mr. Biden is trying to jump-start the electric vehicle market as the global transition to cleaner fuels is accelerating more quickly than expected. That includes the switch to electric vehicles, which are a cornerstone of efforts to reduce emissions in the sector of the U.S. economy that emits the most greenhouse gases: transportation. Government policy missteps could slow or stall that growth.
The administration's policies to boost electric vehicles aren't just aimed at climate change. They also seek to support middle-class jobs for Americans in the auto industry. In a best-case scenario for the administration, those goals work together. The more automakers do to meet the made-in-America requirements in the climate law, the faster the electric vehicle industry will grow to dominate the U.S. auto market.
That relationship is primarily a function of cost. Without an American supply chain, electric vehicles can't qualify for the full $ 7,500 consumer tax credit the law created. Without the full credit, a typical electric vehicle remains less affordable than a conventional automobile. Those requirements don't apply to the leasing market, which explains the shift in consumer preferences.
"I think it's going to be a long time before you see your local waitress come in and buy an E.V. -- they're just too expensive," said Rhett Ricart, the chief executive and owner of the Ricart Automotive Group in Columbus, Ohio, and a former president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
"If we're going to get people to buy these electric vehicles in volume," he said, "we will need more financial assistance from the manufacturers or the government."
Tax credits spur U.S. investment
The climate law spurred investment at a pivotal moment for American automakers. After a prolonged strike, union autoworkers won new concessions for workers who assemble electric vehicles and produce batteries at some plants that the three largest American carmakers run.
Republican leaders and some Wall Street analysts are calling on carmakers to abandon their plans and refocus on gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. They claim the vehicle transition is effectively subsidizing China, which leads the world in electric-car technology and is home to vast stockpiles of critical minerals needed for batteries and other components.
The climate law's champions pitched it as a way to counter China and pull mining and manufacturing to the United States. That group included Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat who cast the decisive vote for the bill and wielded outsize influence on its every detail.
Under the law, companies get lucrative tax credits for investing in electric vehicle production and component parts like advanced batteries. Consumers get up to $ 7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. But at Mr. Manchin's insistence, vehicles qualify for the credit only if they meet certain standards for how much of their content is made and mined in America, or in certain allied countries. Those standards get stricter every year.
Lobbyists from American auto companies warned that those requirements were so stringent that most electric vehicles -- other than Teslas -- would not qualify. Even Tesla vehicles could soon be excluded.
To avoid losing out, automakers have announced new battery projects across the country, particularly near Detroit and through the Southeast. They include plans from foreign automakers like Hyundai that were immediately excluded from the credit but want buyers to have access to it in the future.
"The response has happened faster than I think anyone would have anticipated on the supply side in anticipation of demand increasing," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in an interview. "I think the reason you're seeing these investments is that, ultimately, these companies see that over time, these credits are going to be quite effective in getting consumers to make a decision."
One area where companies have been slower to invest in the United States is in the raw materials and parts needed for batteries, including mines producing minerals like cobalt, and factories making chemicals that go into batteries. In the coming weeks, the Biden administration is expected to issue more rules about when these parts can be sourced from China and other countries, which are likely to determine where many companies base new projects.
Another proposed Biden regulation, from the Environmental Protection Agency, is encouraging automakers' investment in electric vehicle production. It seeks to ensure that two-thirds of all new passenger cars sold in the United States will be all-electric within a decade.
A Treasury rule encourages leasing
There is little evidence that the climate law has supercharged consumer demand for electric vehicles. American consumers bought about 873,000 electric vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. That put the country on a pace to surpass one million electric vehicle sales this year for the first time, but electric vehicles still account for not even one in 10 new cars and trucks sold in the United States.
The pace of that E.V. sales growth is actually slowing: Through the first nine months of 2022, Kelley Blue Book estimated, sales were up nearly 70 percent from the same period in 2021.
The climate law "certainly helped" with electric vehicle sales, said Mike Stanton, the president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. But, he said, "we were hoping for more."
The law has had a mixed effect for consumers and automakers. The federal government previously offered credits to electric car buyers but capped the total that individual automakers could qualify for. Both Tesla and General Motors, the nation's largest sellers of electric vehicles, exceeded that cap, meaning some consumers could not claim a credit for buying their cars.
The climate law restored credits for several of both companies' electric vehicles. It also eliminated credits for many of their competitors, like Hyundai and Kia, that assemble electric cars abroad. As of April, the number of vehicle models that qualify for the full credit had fallen by half compared with how many qualified before the climate law passed. G.M. and Tesla vehicles account for a majority of models that are still eligible for the full credit.
Elaine Buckberg, a former G.M. chief economist who is now a senior fellow at the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard, wrote in a research brief published in August that years of technological improvements and a consumer aversion to gasoline price spikes had helped electric vehicle sales grow even before the climate law passed.
After Mr. Biden signed the law, she wrote, "sales continued to trend up, with no abrupt shift."
Ms. Buckberg and other researchers, like Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, have noted one big way the law has changed the electric-vehicle market: It has pushed consumers toward leasing, not buying. That's because the Treasury Department allowed leased vehicles to be treated differently under the law's domestic content requirements. Companies like Hyundai and Kia are able to capture the full $ 7,500 credit for their electric models -- and pass that on to consumers -- if they lease them.
The auto dealers association calculates that more than half of electric vehicle transactions in the United States -- excluding Teslas, which are not sold through traditional dealership models -- are leased, a large jump from a year ago.
"For a dealer, that's easier for me," said Mr. Ricart, whose holdings in Columbus include a Hyundai dealership.
It is unclear how much the tax credit changes have otherwise influenced consumers' electric vehicle choices. Tesla's sales have grown by a quarter this year -- but on top of the tax credit re-qualification, it also slashed prices.
Auto dealers and administration officials are hopeful that a feature of the law that will take effect on Jan. 1 will further increase sales. It will allow qualified buyers to immediately pass their electric vehicle credit on to a dealer, essentially using it as a down payment, instead of waiting until they file a tax return to receive money back.
Chargers remain a critical part of the equation
Two years after Congress passed a law that included $ 5 billion to install fast chargers at 50-mile intervals along major highways, only a handful of states have awarded contracts to construct stations. Chargers remain relatively scarce on most highways.
Spotty availability of fast chargers is shaping up as one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric vehicles. Most owners charge at home. But on longer voyages, they need chargers capable of charging a car in half an hour to 45 minutes.
Kara Womack, an Atlanta resident, owns a Hyundai electric car but is thinking of trading it in for a hybrid because it's too difficult to drive to visit family in Nashville.
"I don't know if I'm going to be able to find enough chargers to make it," said Ms. Womack, vice president of product at ParkMobile, which advises parking lot operators on where to place chargers. "If you've got an E.V. and you can't take it on a road trip because you can't count on the infrastructure, then it's a challenge."
Last month, modeling that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released predicted that the combination of vehicles qualifying for the consumer tax credits and the eventual build-out of the charging network under the infrastructure law would help electric vehicles make up 42 percent of all vehicles sold in America in less than a decade. That would be more than quadruple today's market share for plug-ins, and significantly higher than the result if Mr. Biden had done nothing to bolster the industry, according to the agency's study.
Billions of private investment dollars could help speed up expanding the charging network. Operators of roadside travel service centers, like Circle K, Pilot Flying J and Sheetz, are installing chargers alongside gas pumps. Carmakers, including G.M. and Mercedes-Benz, are building charging stations. Next year, much of Tesla's charging network -- the largest in the United States -- will open to other vehicles as part of an agreement with Ford, G.M. and other carmakers.
"The states are now rolling and making a lot of progress," said Andrew Dick, business development manager for Electrify America, a charging company. He added, "Things are starting to move very quickly."

Carmakers Downshift on E.V. Spending as Sales Growth Slows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Growth is brisk but slower than expected, causing automakers to question their multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and raising doubts about the effectiveness of federal incentives.
Normally a 50 percent increase in sales is considered very good. But when the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States grew that much during the third quarter from a year earlier, it was a disappointment.
Carmakers and analysts had expected more. Instead of celebrating, auto executives worried that demand for electric vehicles was slackening, raising questions about their plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new models and build factories.
In recent weeks, General Motors, Ford Motor and Tesla cited slower sales and signs that the economy was weakening in announcing that they would delay that spending. That was a blow to the Biden administration's plan to fight climate change by promoting zero-emission vehicles, and it cast doubt on whether generous federal tax credits for electric car buyers were working as well as policymakers had hoped.
"Our commitment to an all-E.V. future is as strong as ever," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., told analysts on a conference call last month. But, she added, the market is turning out to be "a bit bumpy." As a result, G.M. is waiting several months to begin selling some new electric models, including a battery-powered incarnation of the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle.
Ford and G.M. have staked billions to retool factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles, batteries and other components. If the carmakers have miscalculated, the consequences could be severe. (Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, has not yet begun selling any all-electric vehicles in the United States.)
Sales of electric vehicles in China and Europe are also growing more slowly than they were a few months ago.
Still, electric vehicle sales are growing faster than any other major category of automobile, and Americans will buy more than one million of them this year, a record. From July through September, battery-powered cars accounted for 8 percent of the new cars sold in the United States, up from 6 percent a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.
But some once-hot models are selling more slowly. Sales of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which commanded a stiff markup a year ago, slumped 10 percent in October from a year earlier, Ford said last week.
"E.V.s are still in high demand," Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, told analysts. But he added that increased competition had pushed down prices.
Carmakers have introduced at least 14 new all-electric models in the last year, according to Cox, and stepped up production of other models that had been in short supply. Inevitably, some sell better than others.
"The demand is inching up, but it's not moving up nearly to the degree that supply and production is increasing," said Rob Cochran, chief executive of #1 Cochran Automotive, which owns 34 dealerships in Pennsylvania and Ohio that sell nearly all major brands, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Volkswagen.
Even Tesla -- which dominates the electric car market, with about half of all sales in the most recent quarter -- has struggled to sell cars and had to cut prices by thousands of dollars.
Some conservatives have seized on recent data to argue that electric vehicles are overhyped. Republicans like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio have claimed electric vehicles are destroying auto industry jobs, and have proposed rolling back policies designed to encourage people to buy battery-powered cars.
A political agenda is driving some of those proclaiming an end to the electric vehicle boom, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an industry group whose members include carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, charging companies like EVgo and ChargePoint, and suppliers of equipment and raw materials.
"There are a lot of folks eager to draw a conclusion we should be less aggressive with policy," Mr. Gore said.
Some analysts said the uneven growth was not surprising as electric vehicles go from being a niche product to a more mass market offering. Most car owners are still learning about the technology, and carmakers and dealers are figuring out how best to sell to them.
"We had a lot of early adopters buy expensive electric vehicles," said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "Now you're at the point where the Main Street consumer is looking at E.V.s."
Ford illustrates the mixed signals that sales figures are sending. While sales of the Mach-E were up just 1.5 percent in the first 10 months of the year, sales of the F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered pickup, surged 43 percent. All told, sales of Ford electric vehicles rose 13 percent from January through October while sales of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines were up 7 percent. Sales of hybrid vehicles, which combine electric propulsion with internal combustion engines, climbed 19 percent.
The weak Mach-E sales probably reflect competition from the Tesla Model Y more than any broader trend, analysts said. Many buyers might be comparing the two vehicles, which are of a similar size and style. Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y so that the least expensive model is $ 2,500 less than the Ford after federal tax credits are applied.
The end of the United Automobile Workers' recent strikes against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis has refocused attention on traditional carmakers' attempts to compete with Tesla.
Electric vehicles played an important role in the U.A.W. negotiations, and tentative contract agreements extend at least some union privileges to workers at new battery factories. But the deals will increase manufacturing costs and make it that much harder for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to catch up to Tesla, which is not unionized.
Buyers remain interested in electric vehicles, surveys show, but struggle to afford them. The average price paid for an electric vehicle in the United States was less than $ 51,000 in September, according to Cox Automotive. That's a huge decline from last year's $ 65,000. But it's still too high for many new-car buyers, especially as high interest rates have made monthly car payments more expensive. The average rate on a car loan is more than 8 percent, according to Federal Reserve data, compared with less than 5 percent in early 2022.
In the last few years, carmakers flooded the market with S.U.V.s aimed at affluent suburban homeowners. And there is still a dearth of cars priced below $ 30,000 that middle-class buyers can afford.
"A lot of automakers were rushing vehicles into the market," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online car marketplace. "Now they're running into a situation in a rising interest rate environment that they are not priced properly."
Some would-be electric vehicle buyers may also be worried about finding enough places to quickly charge cars on road trips. After price, charging infrastructure is the No. 1 thing people worry about when considering an E.V., many surveys conclude.
Public charging is also essential for anyone who lives in an apartment or can't install a home charger, a group that skews young. "The younger demographic is more open to electric vehicles than the older demographic," Mr. Cochran, the Ohio and Pennsylvania dealer, said. "Typically it's the younger demographic that's in apartment settings. The fact that the infrastructure is not built up is a deterrent."
At least two of Mr. Cochran's customers returned newly purchased electric vehicles after discovering there weren't enough chargers near their homes, he said.
For people interested in buying an electric vehicle, the good news is that prices are likely to continue falling as carmakers ramp up new factories. Starting in January, dealers will be able to apply federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 when a customer buys a car. Previously, buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to claim the credit.
The charging system is also improving, albeit slowly. Parts of Tesla's network of fast chargers, the largest in the United States, will open to Ford, G.M. and other brands next year. Other carmakers are building their own chargers. Mercedes-Benz said last week that it would install at least 55 stations at high-end shopping malls in the United States and Canada operated by Simon Property Group, a large real estate firm.
Carmakers have gotten the message that selling electric vehicles is different from selling gasoline cars. "Charging," said Andrew Cornelia, chief executive of Mercedes's high-power charging unit in North America, "is still a critical problem to solve."

GM and Tesla vehicles account for a majority of models that are still eligible for the full credit.
Elaine Buckberg, a former GM chief economist who is now a senior fellow at the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard, wrote in a research brief published in August that years of technological improvements and a consumer aversion to gasoline price spikes had helped electric vehicle sales grow even before the climate law passed.
After Biden signed the law, she wrote, “sales continued to trend up, with no abrupt shift.”
Buckberg and other researchers, like Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, have noted one big way the law has changed the electric vehicle market: It has pushed consumers toward leasing, not buying. That’s because the Treasury Department allowed leased vehicles to be treated differently under the law’s domestic content requirements. Companies such as Hyundai and Kia are able to capture the full $7,500 credit for their electric models — and pass that on to consumers — if they lease them.
The auto dealers association calculates that more than half of electric vehicle transactions in the United States — excluding Teslas, which are not sold through traditional dealership models — are leased, a large jump from a year ago.
“For a dealer, that’s easier for me,” said Ricart, whose holdings in Columbus include a Hyundai dealership.
It is unclear how much the tax credit changes have otherwise influenced consumers’ electric vehicle choices. Tesla’s sales have grown by one-quarter this year — but on top of the tax credit re-qualification, it also slashed prices.
Auto dealers and administration officials are hopeful that a feature of the law that will take effect on Jan. 1 will further increase sales. It will allow qualified buyers to immediately pass their electric vehicle credit on to a dealer, essentially using it as a down payment, instead of waiting until they file a tax return to receive money back.
Chargers remain a critical part of the equation
Two years after Congress passed a law that included $5 billion to install fast chargers at 50-mile intervals along major highways, only a handful of states have awarded contracts to construct stations. Chargers remain relatively scarce on most highways.
Spotty availability of fast chargers is shaping up as one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric vehicles. Most owners charge at home. But on longer voyages, they need chargers capable of charging a car in half an hour to 45 minutes.
Kara Womack, an Atlanta resident, owns a Hyundai electric car but is thinking of trading it in for a hybrid because it’s too difficult to drive to visit family in Nashville, Tennessee.
“I don’t know if I’m going to be able to find enough chargers to make it,” said Womack, vice president of product at ParkMobile, which advises parking lot operators on where to place chargers. “If you’ve got an EV and you can’t take it on a road trip because you can’t count on the infrastructure, then it’s a challenge.”
Last month, modeling that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released predicted that the combination of vehicles qualifying for the consumer tax credits and the eventual build-out of the charging network under the infrastructure law would help electric vehicles make up 42% of all vehicles sold in the United States in less than a decade. That would be more than quadruple today’s market share for plug-ins, and significantly higher than the result if Biden had done nothing to bolster the industry, according to the agency’s study.
Billions of private investment dollars could help speed up expanding the charging network. Operators of roadside travel service centers, such as Circle K, Pilot Flying J and Sheetz, are installing chargers alongside gas pumps. Carmakers, including GM and Mercedes-Benz, are building charging stations. Next year, much of Tesla’s charging network — the largest in the United States — will open to other vehicles as part of an agreement with Ford, GM and other carmakers.
“The states are now rolling and making a lot of progress,” said Andrew Dick, business development manager for Electrify America, a charging company. He added, “Things are starting to move very quickly.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For years, Angelo Bianco, a Florida developer, drove past the enormous, wooded IBM corporate campus off Interstate 95 in Boca Raton, Fla., without paying it much heed. But his interest was piqued when a broker informed him that the property was for sale.
IBM designed the secluded 550-acre site in the 1960s because it "didn't want people in their secret development lab space," Mr. Bianco said. It was there that its engineers produced the first personal computer, as well as the prototype for the first smartphone.
Nearly 10,000 workers were employed on the complex in its heyday, but after IBM moved its operations to Raleigh, N.C., and eventually sold the property in 1996, the site became something of a white elephant. A series of owners struggled to successfully recast it, selling off tracts and ultimately renaming it the Boca Raton Innovation Campus.
The site was acquired five years ago for a reported $ 179 million by a group of buyers led by the CP Group, a commercial real estate firm where Mr. Bianco works as managing partner. After studying contemporary corporate campuses belonging to Apple, Google and Nike, Mr. Bianco said, the company decided to open it up to the community rather than keeping it shrouded from view.
As hybrid work models continue to evolve and transform the workplace, owners of commercial real estate have been rethinking how the corporate office should look -- even in a market like South Florida, which has proved better insulated from the downturn in office space that has hobbled other metro areas like New York and San Francisco.
Office vacancy rates topped 19 percent nationally in the third quarter of this year, close to their record in 1991, according to Moody's Analytics. Cities with ample new construction, like Dallas and Austin, Texas, showed higher vacancy rates. But Miami is among the markets where vacancies declined.
After an initial rush to the suburbs during the height of the pandemic, tenants in Florida are again searching for space downtown and in central office districts, said Jonathan Kingsley, a vice chairman of Colliers International, a real estate advisory firm. And they are looking for a more robust experience as they try to lure workers back to the office.
"They need to have fitness centers or wellness rooms, access to restaurants and maybe some retail," Mr. Kingsley said.
But incorporating new amenities that will appeal to today's workers is an expensive prospect for developers, who are also facing limitations on access to public transportation and continuous competition for space, particularly in the South Florida market.
Hedge funds and technology companies that relocated to the area during the pandemic, or expanded there, have snatched up real estate. The billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin turned heads with his purchase of office buildings in Palm Beach and Miami's trendy Brickell district, where he intends to build a skyscraper that will house Citadel, his hedge fund.
The rush over the past three years has leveled out, but demand has remained relatively steady in the three counties that make up South Florida: Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. Since the start of 2023, newcomer tenants account for 21 percent of the 3.8 million square feet of active deals in Miami-Dade, said Tere Blanca, chief executive of Blanca CRE. Rents have held steady, and in some of the hottest neighborhoods, like Brickell, they have risen.
A key reason for the sustained strength, Ms. Blanca said, is that the region attracts a diverse array of industries, rather than relying on one or two sectors. Typically, businesses open regional headquarters or smaller offices -- some hoping to tap into the swell of new talent that has migrated to the area.
Another draw are the investments by well-capitalized owners aiming to build community by creating what they call the "tenant experience" with updated amenities and events that often involve food trucks or 5-kilometer races.
The Y-shaped, one-story office building at the heart of the Boca Raton Innovation Campus was designed by Marcel Breuer and Robert F. Gatje and is the largest in the state. To update it, CP Group added skylights, courtyards, entrances and amenities, like a convenience store, a beauty salon, coffee shops and art displays, which are open to the public, as are the walking trails and the lake at the property's center.
"We want people, when they come here, to feel like they're getting more than an office," Mr. Bianco said. "People don't want to work in an environment that's separated from the world anymore. They want energy and excitement and stuff near them."
Office space, like its retail counterpart, can thrive if it is relevant and in a good location, said Scott Sherman, founder and principal of Torose Equities, a Miami developer. In August, Torose closed on a 222,000-square-foot office building built in 1972 in pedestrian-friendly Coral Gables, Fla., for a reported $ 54.4 million. His firm intends to update the building with fresh amenities to draw tenants.
"More and more companies are saying you have to come to the office three, four, five days a week," Mr. Sherman said. "The more the office environment is enjoyable, the easier to get people back in."
When Andrew B. Hellinger, a co-founder and principal of Urban-X Group, a developer in Coral Gables, started construction in 2018 on River Landing, a shopping center, rental apartments and a dock along the Miami River, the top floor had been promised to AMC Entertainment. Then the pandemic came, and the theater chain, in deep financial distress, was happy to give up the space.
In its place, Mr. Hellinger and his partners turned the three stories on top of the complex into 150,000 square feet of office space. Now, he said, the offices are 75 percent leased.
"The marketplace is starting to understand work is not just a place to go to the office and leave," Mr. Hellinger said. Even for those who commute, "you might want to hang out and not fight traffic."
Commuting challenges are a main reason that more companies are putting a priority on proximity to public transportation, said Mr. Kingsley of Colliers. Prospective tenants want to "make it easy on employees, make them want to come to work," he said. For example, a British-based design firm looking to open an office in South Florida detailed clear needs to him: a "cool, funky space" near public transit.
The newly expanded high-speed rail line in Florida, called Brightline, is a "game-changer," said Andrea J. Heuson, a professor of finance and an academic director of real estate programs at the Miami Herbert Business School. The train service will allow much more accessibility to the northern part of South Florida, where rents are lower, which she said might ultimately hurt Miami-Dade in favor of Broward and Palm Beach.
Indeed, Mr. Bianco's top price per square foot in his Boca Raton building commands about half of the highest rents to the south. The property's proximity to Tri-Rail's Boca Raton station, the busiest stop in the 70-mile-long commuter rail line, is a draw -- one that he hopes makes the campus even more attractive.
The Boca Raton City Council recently voted to rezone the property so his firm can move forward with plans to add 1,250 apartments, a grocery store, restaurants, a hotel and a performance venue.
As Mr. Bianco guides prospective tenants through the building, he points to a collection of photographs from the dawn of the computer revolution.
"I tell them when IBM was here, that was like Google and Apple in the same company," Mr. Bianco said. Perhaps that lineage is part of the lure. The building is now 90 percent leased, up from 70 percent when his group took ownership.

The one-story office building was updated with a convenience store, a beauty salon, coffee shops, art displays -- such as Hubert Phipps's "Rocket" sculpture, top right -- and skylights by the CP Group, which acquired it five years ago.

How Your Child’s School Bus Might Prevent Blackouts

SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. — The four vehicles parked at a depot in South Burlington, Vermont, look no different from the yellow school buses familiar to millions of schoolchildren. But beneath their steel shells, these buses are packed with technology that could be vital in the transition to clean energy.
While their main job remains transporting children, the vehicles take on a second task while sitting idle during school hours. The local utility puts their batteries to work, storing excess renewable energy so it can be pumped back into the grid when needed.
The buses are a test of the idea that electric vehicles, which skeptics often see as an expensive burden that could bring down electric grids, could be just the opposite: a buffer that soaks up power when there is too much and provides it when demand for electricity surges.
Any suitably equipped electric vehicle can be used to store surplus electricity, avoiding the need for utilities to fire up gas-fueled power plants when there isn’t enough sun or wind. But school buses work especially well because they have big batteries and spend much of the day parked.
“There’s no better tool than an electric school bus fleet to sort of smooth those curves,” said Duncan McIntyre, the CEO of Highland Fleets, a company near Boston that provides the buses and equipment. Synop, a New York firm, provides the software to manage the interaction between vehicles, chargers and the grid.
Utilities across the country have been testing the ability of batteries in electric vehicles to help stabilize increasingly unreliable power plants and lines that have faltered under stress from hurricanes, heat waves and other extreme weather linked to climate change.
Grueling summer heat this year tested the Texas grid for weeks, forcing officials to plead with homeowners and businesses to use less energy so the state could avoid rolling blackouts or the kind of power failure that left millions of people without light or heat in 2021.
Some energy experts say one solution to these problems is to corral thousands of rooftop solar panels, home batteries and electric vehicles around a city or state into virtual power plants. Tethered together with the help of software, the collective capacity of such devices to generate and store energy can be more than enough to avoid a blackout when power plants falter or strong winds take down a transmission line.
Grids primarily use power plants with quick-start abilities, known as peaking units, to serve as backup sources of energy. But such plants typically use gas, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and are expensive to run and maintain. Many have also failed to perform when they are most needed.
Electric school buses, in particular, could be very useful to the grid because of their limited use during school days and broad availability during summer’s sweltering temperatures.
Schools in every state except Wyoming have committed to begin using electric buses, though the number on the roads is small at fewer than 3,000 as of June 30, according the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit that works on the energy, environment and related issues.
California’s total number of school buses leads the nation, and Montgomery County, Maryland, has more than any other school district.
“We’re on the edge of the technology, which doesn’t happen often for school buses,” said Daoud Chaaya, vice president of sales for Thomas Built, a unit of the truck maker Daimler that supplied South Burlington’s electric buses.
The World Resources Institute is pushing U.S. policymakers to make sure all school buses are battery-powered by 2030, a goal that would also reduce asthma and other diseases in children by eliminating pollution from combustion-engine buses.
“There’s definitely a lot of challenges,” said Sue Gander, director of the institute’s electric school bus initiative. “It’s going to take some time for everybody to get there.”
Cost remains a big hurdle: An electric school bus can cost three times as much as a $100,000 diesel bus. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, allocated $5 billion over five years to help schools buy electric buses, and the price is expected to fall in coming years. In the meantime, school districts can defray their expenses by letting utilities use buses to store energy.
In South Burlington, the school district leases the electric buses from Highland, which also supplies equipment to recharge them and pays the electricity bills. Those bills are lower than normal because of a deal that lets Green Mountain Power, the utility serving most of Vermont, draw power from the bus batteries when demand surges. They are part of a network that also includes batteries that homeowners install to provide backup power during blackouts.
In total, Green Mountain Power has access to 50 megawatts of battery storage from school buses, home batteries and other sources, said Mari McClure, the utility’s CEO. That’s as much as a small gas power plant. Unlike a plant that runs on fossil fuels, the power is available almost instantly.
The utility asked Vermont regulators last month to allow it to install batteries at the homes of its customers who don’t already have one, an effort that would dovetail with its work on school buses.
Over time, McClure said, enough electric school buses and home batteries may be connected to the grid to stop her utility from needing to buy electricity from out-of-state power plants. Commercial vans, pickups and garbage trucks could join the network as more businesses and cities buy electric vehicles.
But linking these vehicle batteries to the grid will take not only time but also money. While a standard electric vehicle charger for buses can cost $3,000 to $7,000 to install, initial data from early demonstrations of electric pickups indicates that equipment needed to send power back to the grid ranges from $10,000 to $58,000, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit organization. Utilities may also need to upgrade their power lines, transformers and other equipment.
There are also difficult legal and financial issues to sort out. Many states have struggled to determine how to compensate homeowners and businesses for power they deliver to the electric grid from batteries and rooftop solar panels.
Energy experts said that such issues would get addressed and that the high costs of electric vehicles would come down as utilities, regulators and manufacturers gained more experience.
Vehicle batteries can meet some of the needs of customers, utilities and the wholesale market for electricity, said Daniel Bowermaster, senior program manager for electric transportation at the Electric Power Research Institute. “From the technological standpoint, those things are within the realm of possibility.”
Officials in South Burlington, whose diesel bus fleet is mostly paid off, said they were willing to spend more on electric buses. The new buses are much better for the environment and public health, said Tim Jarvis, the school district’s finance manager.
There are other benefits, too.
Sean McKenzie, transportation coordinator for South Burlington schools, who drives a bus because of a labor shortage, said children no longer had to shout above the roar of a diesel engine.
“I was surprised that they were quieter,” he said.

Trying to Sell A.I. to a Pentagon Set in Its Ways: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When he reflected on his time as a Navy SEAL serving in Afghanistan a decade ago, Brandon Tseng wondered why he and his team did not have any way to see inside buildings they were about to raid and reduce the chances of walking into a deadly trap.
He brought that question to his brother Ryan, a tech whiz who had invented a type of wireless cellphone charger when he was in college. After Brandon Tseng left the military, he joined with his brother to find ways to apply technology to national security challenges and quickly had what he remembers as his "aha" moment.
The rapidly emerging field of artificial intelligence, he believed, could be applied to fast-evolving hardware like drones to transform how they are used in war, like sending a tiny, self-piloted vehicle to do reconnaissance inside a structure that troops were about to enter. Even fighter jets could perhaps be turned into A.I.-controlled robot drones.
The company the Tseng brothers created in 2015, named Shield AI, is now valued by venture capital investors at $ 2.7 billion. The firm has 625 employees in Texas, California, Virginia and Abu Dhabi. And the Tsengs' work is starting to show real-world results, with one of their early products having been deployed by the Israel Defense Forces in the immediate aftermath of the coordinated attacks last month by Hamas.
Israeli forces used a small Shield AI drone last month, the company said, to search for barricaded shooters and civilian victims in buildings that had been targeted by Hamas fighters. The drone, called the Nova 2, can autonomously conduct surveillance inside multistory buildings or even underground complexes without GPS or a human pilot.
Shield AI is one of a handful of start-ups demonstrating the potential of cutting-edge technology to revolutionize war-fighting tools and help the United States keep its military advantage over China.
The company and others like Anduril Industries, Autonodyne, EpiSci and Merlin Labs are developing new and more powerful ways for the Pentagon to gather and analyze information and act on it, including flying planes without pilots, creating swarms of autonomous surveillance and attack drones, and making targeting decisions faster than humans could.
Shield AI's efforts to convince the Pentagon of the technology's capabilities were on display one recent morning on the prairies of North Dakota as three of its larger military drones lifted off, buzzed across the sky and then were turned over to Shield AI's artificial intelligence programming to decide on their own how to carry out the surveillance mission they had been assigned.
"HiveMind is operational," said Brian Marchini, an aerospace engineer for Shield AI, referring to the company's artificial intelligence program. "We have control," he told the human pilots sitting in a tower above him, who until that point had been remotely directing the drones.
Shield AI's business plan is to build an A.I. pilot system that can be loaded onto a variety of aerial platforms, from small drones like Nova 2 to fighter jets.
The drones flying over North Dakota demonstrated how far the technology has come. Their mission for the test was to search for ground fire nearby, a task not unlike monitoring troop movements. When the A.I. program kicked in, it created perfectly efficient flight patterns for the three vehicles, avoiding no-fly zones and collisions and wrapping up their work as fast as possible.
But Shield AI's story also demonstrates the many hurdles that the new generation of military contractors face as they compete for Pentagon funding against the far bigger and more entrenched weapons makers that have been supplying the military for decades. And the growing role of artificial intelligence in national security is playing out against concerns about granting life-or-death decisions to software programs and at a time when governments are taking initial steps to regulate development of the technology.
Shield AI is still losing money, burning through what it has raised from investors as it plows the funding into research -- it intends to invest $ 2 billion over the coming five years to build out its A.I. pilot system.
More fundamentally, the Tsengs and their team have so far won only a tiny sliver of funding from the Pentagon, at least by the standards of the multibillion-dollar contracts that go to the traditional arms makers like Lockheed, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. If solving the technological problems and building the systems they envision is the first challenge, cracking the byzantine and cutthroat government procurement culture is the second, one they have come to recognize requires lobbying and a deep understanding of how Washington works.
The task is all the more complicated because the Pentagon is moving slowly and cautiously -- too cautiously, critics say -- away from its focus on big weapons platforms like planes and ships to embrace smarter systems and the potential of artificial intelligence.
"Put simply, the Pentagon needs to accelerate -- not slow -- its adoption of responsible A.I.," Michèle A. Flournoy, a deputy under secretary of defense in the Obama administration, said in a recent article in Foreign Affairs.
"If it doesn't, Washington could lose the military superiority that underwrites the interests of the United States, the security of its allies and partners, and the rules-based international order," said Ms. Flournoy, who has advised Shield AI.
Human Versus A.I.
Shield AI's 125-pound V-Bat drone, lifting off vertically from the remote weapons testing center in North Dakota and filling the air with the smell of fuel, was loaded with software seeking to do far more than what an autopilot program could.
What distinguishes artificial intelligence from the programs that have for decades helped run everything from dishwashers to jetliners is that it is not following a script.
These systems ingest data collected by various sensors -- from a plane's velocity to the wind speed to types of potential threats -- and then use their computer brains to carry out specific missions without continuous human direction.
"A brilliant autopilot still requires that you tell it where to go or what to do," said Nathan Michael, Shield AI's chief technology officer and until recently a research professor at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. "What we are building is a system that can make decisions based on its observations in the world and based on the objectives that it is striving to achieve."
The advances in the software first grabbed headlines in August 2020, when an early version being developed by a company since acquired by Shield AI had a breakthrough moment in an Air Force competition called AlphaDogfight. The company's software defeated programs built by other vendors, including Lockheed Martin, the world's largest military contractor, and then moved on to a virtual showdown with an Air Force pilot, call sign Banger, who had more than 2,000 hours experience flying an F-16.
"Human versus A.I. -- fight's on," said Chris DeMay, a former test pilot who was helping supervise the Defense Department competition.
Again and again, the A.I. pilot quickly defeated the human-piloted jet, in part because the A.I.-guided plane was able to both maneuver more quickly and target its opponent accurately even when making extreme turns.
"The standard things we do as fighter pilots are not working," the Air Force pilot said just before his virtual plane was destroyed for the fifth and final time.
To some, this was the military equivalent of when IBM's Deep Blue computer defeated the grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a game of chess in 1997.
The Tseng brothers are part of a new breed of military contractors who combine a Silicon Valley start-up ethos with an eagerness to bring greater technological sophistication to national security challenges.
They grew up in the Seattle area and Florida in a household where their Taiwan-born father was an electrical engineer and small-business owner, a cross between scientist and entrepreneur that rubbed off on his sons.
Brandon Tseng, now 37, first began to wonder what kind of new tools he could try to build for the military while at a Navy SEAL training camp in Mississippi. He was practicing the kind of raid on a building that he would soon be carrying out in Afghanistan, except the enemy in this case was holding a paint gun. A slug of paint hit him in the face.
"You're dead," his instructor told him, leaving Mr. Tseng frustrated that he had no way of knowing the shot was coming. He felt similarly when his SEAL team was clearing buildings in Afghanistan without any sense of what threats might be inside.
Ryan Tseng, now 39, made a name for himself as an undergraduate at the University of Florida when he came up with a lower-cost, more compact way to use wireless charging pads to power cellphones, an idea he ultimately patented and sold to Qualcomm, the wireless technology giant. They have a third brother, Nick Tseng, 34, also an electrical engineer, who works at the company.
The software that Shield AI is developing for small drones like the Nova 2 that was used in Israel could be loaded onto a robot fighter jet drone that would fly out in front of a human-piloted F-35, looking for missile threats or enemy planes, taking on the risks before the human pilot gets into harm's way. But turning these ideas into a reality is a matter of clearing daily challenges.
When Shield AI sent three of its drones on an early test run, they ran into trouble: The drones were sending too much data back and forth. "We were bludgeoning the available bandwidth," explained Mr. Marchini, the Shield AI aerospace engineer, resulting in adjustments to fix the problem.
The Nova 2 also at times had issues operating indoors, running into shower curtains. It turned out that its propeller was making the curtains move, confusing the device.
The challenges of developing a system that can carry out a mission on its own and make decisions about when to unleash lethal weapons are complex enough that some of Shield AI's competitors are aiming for more incremental progress, such as better autopilot tools.
Merlin Labs is focusing on a system that can fly one of the Pentagon's giant transport planes or refueling tankers, first with just one pilot instead of two and eventually entirely on its own.
Another competitor, Anduril, is building a software system to integrate all of the data that will flood into the Air Force from drone and satellite sources to help human pilots find and strike targets. It is also building a new generation of robot drones that can fly on their own.
"What we are talking about is not just building a pilot," said Christian Brose, the chief strategy officer at Anduril. "It is building a weapons system. And the weapons system encompasses piloting."
Turning Tech Into Business
None of the competitive or technological hurdles facing Shield AI will matter much if the company cannot solve an even more pressing problem: bringing in some substantial revenue.
Its revenues have grown from $ 23 million in 2019 to $ 102 million last year, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times. That is a big jump, in a way, but the total is still tiny for a company with more than 600 employees.
The company lost about $ 100 million between 2019 and 2021, internal data shows, and it expects to lose another $ 70 million this year. Its biggest source of revenue now is the V-Bat, its vertical takeoff drone that operates in most of its current Marine Corps deployments without artificial intelligence. The company has told investors that its goal is to generate nearly $ 750 million in annual sales and $ 100 million in profit by 2026.
Shield AI has raised about $ 770 million in venture capital, but subsists largely on money given out by research divisions at the Pentagon and the one long-term military contract, which it secured by buying an even smaller drone maker that already had secured the deal.
It just raised another $ 200 million in venture capital, including from a fund led by Thomas Tull, a onetime Hollywood producer of films like "Inception" and "Superman Returns" who is now investing in military start-ups.
One recent afternoon, in a conference room in the company's offices in Crystal City, Va., Brandon Tseng was huddled with his growing team of lobbyists. They were about to head to Capitol Hill to try, once again, to round up support among lawmakers to squeeze the Pentagon to start buying A.I. pilot tools, including perhaps the company's products, in larger numbers.
In 2021, Shield AI hired Chip Burkhalter, a former State Department official, to create Shield AI's first in-house lobbying team. Along with a team of outside consultants, the company is now burning more than $ 1 million a year lobbying the Pentagon, Congress and the administration.
Its agenda includes adding around $ 30 million to the Pentagon budget that could be used to help fund contracts that Shield AI could tap into, or at least to promote creation of a new Pentagon office that would help push progress on building autonomous systems.
But progress still was slow. Mr. Burkhalter told Brandon Tseng during their government affairs update meeting -- a reporter from The Times was allowed to sit in the room and listen -- that he had been unable to secure support this year to set up the new Pentagon unit they hope will be called the "Joint Autonomy Office," meaning a decision on it will be pushed until at least 2025.
"Are these going to be the exact same problems in 2026?" Mr. Tseng asked his team.
"Yes, I think so," Mr. Burkhalter responded.
The lobbying team is still making trips to Capitol Hill, looking for ways to shake some funding loose. "OK guys -- go reform the acquisition system," Mr. Tseng joked with his in-house lobbying team as they prepared to get into an Uber for the ride over to Capitol Hill.
Pentagon officials said the A.I. software being developed by companies like Shield AI is at the heart of their plan to build a new force of more than 1,000 robot drones that can act as wingmen to human-controlled fighter jets.
But Frank Kendall, the Air Force secretary, said the problem, in part, is that Congress has been slow to approve his spending plans, including
$ 5.8 billion over the next five years to build the fleet of robot fighter jets. "I've got a long list of things I want to buy and I can't buy right now," he said in an interview.
So at least for now, Shield AI's search for meaningful revenue continues.
"Shield has a really great software technology. This is their key asset," said one of the company's lead investors, Peter Levine of the venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz. "But look, it's never a done deal. I deal with start-ups all the time. There's a lot of complexity and a lot of hurdles that start-ups face."

Governments Warn A.I. Poses Risk of 'Catastrophic' Harm: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At a U.K. summit, 28 governments, including China and the U.S., signed a declaration agreeing to cooperate on evaluating the risks of artificial intelligence.
In 1950, Alan Turing, the gifted British mathematician and code-breaker, published an academic paper. His aim, he wrote, was to consider the question, "Can machines think?"
The answer runs to almost 12,000 words. But it ends succinctly: "We can only see a short distance ahead," Mr. Turing wrote, "but we can see plenty there that needs to be done."
More than seven decades on, that sentiment sums up the mood of many policymakers, researchers and tech leaders attending Britain's A.I. Safety Summit on Wednesday, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hopes will position the country as a leader in the global race to harness and regulate artificial intelligence.
On Wednesday morning, his government released a document called the Bletchley Declaration, signed by representatives from the 28 countries attending the event, including the U.S. and China, which warned of the dangers posed by the most advanced "frontier" A.I. systems.
"There is potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these A.I. models," the declaration said.
"Many risks arising from A.I. are inherently international in nature, and so are best addressed through international cooperation. We resolve to work together in an inclusive manner to ensure human-centric, trustworthy and responsible A.I."
The document fell short, however, of setting specific policy goals. A second meeting is scheduled to be held in six months in South Korea and a third in France in a year.
Governments have scrambled to address the risks posed by the fast-evolving technology since last year's release of ChatGPT, a humanlike chatbot that demonstrated how the latest models are advancing in powerful and unpredictable ways.
Future generations of A.I. systems could accelerate the diagnosis of disease, help combat climate change and streamline manufacturing processes, but also present significant dangers in terms of job losses, disinformation and national security. A British government report last week warned that advanced A.I. systems "may help bad actors perform cyberattacks, run disinformation campaigns and design biological or chemical weapons."
Mr. Sunak promoted this week's event, which gathers governments, companies, researchers and civil society groups, as a chance to start developing global safety standards.
The two-day summit in Britain is at Bletchley Park, a countryside estate 50 miles north of London, where Mr. Turing helped crack the Enigma code used by the Nazis during World War II. Considered one of the birthplaces of modern computing, the location is a conscious nod to the prime minister's hopes that Britain could be at the center of another world-leading initiative.
Bletchley is "evocative in that it captures a very defining moment in time, where great leadership was required from government but also a moment when computing was front and center," said Ian Hogarth, a tech entrepreneur and investor who was appointed by Mr. Sunak to lead the government's task force on A.I. risk, and who helped organize the summit. "We need to come together and agree on a wise way forward."
With Elon Musk and other tech executives in the audience, King Charles III delivered a video address in the opening session, recorded at Buckingham Palace before he departed for a state visit to Kenya this week. "We are witnessing one of the greatest technological leaps in the history of human endeavor," he said. "There is a clear imperative to ensure that this rapidly evolving technology remains safe and secure."
Vice President Kamala Harris, and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, were taking part in meetings on behalf of the United States.
Wu Zhaohui, China's vice minister of science and technology, told attendees that Beijing was willing to "enhance dialogue and communication" with other countries about A.I. safety. China is developing its own initiative for A.I. governance, he said, adding that the technology is "uncertain, unexplainable and lacks transparency."
In a speech on Friday, Mr. Sunak addressed criticism he had received from China hawks over the attendance of a delegation from Beijing. "Yes -- we've invited China," he said. "I know there are some who will say they should have been excluded. But there can be no serious strategy for A.I. without at least trying to engage all of the world's leading A.I. powers."
With development of leading A.I. systems concentrated in the United States and a small number of other countries, some attendees said regulations must account for the technology's impact globally. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a minister of technology representing India, said policies must be set by a "coalition of nations rather than just one country to two countries."
"By allowing innovation to get ahead of regulation, we open ourselves to the toxicity and misinformation and weaponization that we see on the internet today, represented by social media," he said.
Executives from leading technology and A.I. companies, including Anthropic, Google DeepMind, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI and Tencent, were attending the conference. Also sending representatives were a number of civil society groups, among them Britain's Ada Lovelace Institute and the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit in Massachusetts.
In a surprise move, Mr. Sunak announced on Monday that he would take part in a live interview with Mr. Musk on his social media platform X after the summit ends on Thursday.
Some analysts argue that the conference will be heavier on symbolism than substance, with a number of key political leaders absent, including President Biden, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany.
And many governments are moving forward with their own laws and regulations. Mr. Biden announced an executive order this week requiring A.I. companies to assess national security risks before releasing their technology to the public. The European Union's A.I. Act, which could be finalized within weeks, represents a far-reaching attempt to protect citizens from harm. China is also cracking down on how A.I. is used, including censoring chatbots.
Britain, home to many universities where artificial intelligence research is being conducted, has taken a more hands-off approach. The government believes that existing laws and regulations are sufficient for now, while announcing a new A.I. Safety Institute that will evaluate and test new models.
Mr. Hogarth, whose team has negotiated early access to the models of several large A.I. companies to research their safety, said he believed that Britain could play an important role in figuring out how governments could "capture the benefits of these technologies as well as putting guardrails around them."
In his speech last week, Mr. Sunak affirmed that Britain's approach to the potential risks of the technology is "not to rush to regulate."
"How can we write laws that make sense for something we don't yet fully understand?" he said.

U.A.W. Gains May Have Set New Bar for Unions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Experts said the union's new contracts could set precedents that give labor advantages when bargaining contracts and organizing workers.
Laying out a tentative contract agreement to end a six-week wave of walkouts at Ford Motor, the United Automobile Workers president made an unusual pitch to other labor unions.
"We invite unions around the country to align your contract expirations with our own," the U.A.W. leader, Shawn Fain, said Sunday night.
"If we're going to truly take on the billionaire class and rebuild the economy so that it starts to work for the benefit of the many and not the few," Mr. Fain added, "then it's important that we not only strike, but that we strike together."
While it remains to be seen whether other unions follow the U.A.W.'s lead, Mr. Fain's invitation highlights the sweeping ambition of the union's strategy during the recent strike, the first to target all three Detroit automakers simultaneously.
Beyond seeking the largest wage and benefit increases in decades -- and a reversal of the concessions the union made during the companies' downturn, such as lower wage tiers for newer workers -- Mr. Fain repeatedly spoke of fighting for "the entire working class."
Labor experts said the proposals that union negotiators agreed to with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, had produced gains that could in fact reverberate well beyond the workers that the union represented.
"It is a historic and transformative victory by the U.A.W.," said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Dr. Lichtenstein said that winning substantial gains through a strike in a critical industry demonstrated the benefits of work stoppages after decades in which workers had been taught to regard strikes warily.
"Fain says: 'Hey, strikes work, solidarity works; we're more unified now than before the strike,"' he added. "I think that's a powerful argument unions can take elsewhere."
Even before the strike ended, unions at other companies appeared to be doing just that.
In an interview in late September, David Pryzbylski, a lawyer who represents employers, said union officials in two separate contract negotiations had invoked the U.A.W. when discussing the possibility of a strike. "Outside the U.A.W., it's putting wind in their sails," Mr. Pryzbylski said. "They may be blustering, but I am seeing it already trickle down."
A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns that an emboldened labor movement was increasing strike activity and "causing collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities" by harming the economic ecosystem that depended on automakers and other employers.
The element of strategy that the U.A.W. brought to its strike may also prove instructive to other workers and unions. Rather than ask all employees to strike at once, the union started small, with one key plant at each of the Big Three, then ramped up as it sought to bring additional pressure. The U.A.W. refrained from expanding the strike when it felt a company was bargaining productively, and it expanded to a highly valuable plant when it felt a company was dragging its feet -- in both cases, to create an incentive for the companies to engage with the union.
The approach may not translate perfectly to other industries, such as retail and hospitality, that are harder to disrupt with the loss of a small number of locations. But Peter Olney, a former organizing director with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the strategy was more widely applicable than it might appear at first glance.
He cited the possibility of organizing and striking at coffee bean roasting plants and distribution centers for a company like Starbucks, where workers at hundreds of retail stores in the United States have organized over the past few years. "They have 9,000 locations, there's a lot of redundancy and replication," Mr. Olney said, referring to company-owned stores in the United States. "But there are some choke points in that system, too."
And it is difficult for service-sector industries to send operations offshore in response to labor unrest, because proximity to customers is critical. By contrast, the U.A.W. may have to contend with the risk that companies shift production to Mexico as labor costs increase.
"That's where the international solidarity aspect of it comes in -- the need to build up a cross-border network with Mexico," Mr. Olney said. Last year, workers at a large G.M. plant in the country voted out a union accused of colluding with management in favor of an independent union.
In some ways, the recent U.A.W. effort builds on the gains made by unions involved in other high-profile standoffs. To resolve a nearly five-month strike with Hollywood writers in September, major studios agreed to a set of restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. The agreement was a break with employers' typical insistence that management should have control over technology and investment decisions.
The tentative U.A.W. contracts award the union more influence over such decision-making as well -- for example, by allowing workers to strike against the entire company over the threat of a plant shutdown before their contract has expired. The union also successfully pressed Stellantis to reopen an Illinois plant that the company had closed.
Mr. Pryzbylski, the management-side lawyer, said that while such strike provisions and plant reopenings are not unheard of, they are uncommon.
Dr. Lichtenstein said securing these gains in such a high-profile context could prompt employees at other companies to demand a say in decisions that their employers had typically characterized as management prerogatives. "It restores a kind of social and political character to investment decisions," he said. "It's something the left has wanted for over a century."
In other cases, the U.A.W. managed to extract concessions at plants where it doesn't yet represent workers -- another unusual win that could be mimicked by fellow unions. Ford agreed that U.A.W. members would be allowed to transfer into battery and electric vehicles plants under construction in Michigan and Tennessee, and that these plants would fall under the union's national contract if the workers unionized there. According to the U.A.W., that would happen without the need to hold a union election at either site.
Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries, called these arrangements a "huge historic, unprecedented deal" for helping to ensure that the E.V. transition benefited workers.
U.A.W. officials say that adding new members is critical to the union's survival, and that the Big Three contracts will provide a major boost to these efforts because organizers can point to large concrete benefits of unionizing.
"We're not going to win a contract victory this big in the future if we're not able to start organizing, especially in the E.V. sector," said Mike Miller, a U.A.W. regional director in the Western United States. "It has to involve Tesla, Volkswagen and Hyundai."
But some experts said the momentum of the recent contracts could help organizing campaigns that were even further afield. "It's not just personal vehicle manufacturing -- it's the fleets of delivery vans, big electric buses and trains," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively.
Ms. Smiley noted that many of these companies, just like electric vehicle manufacturers, had received public subsidies, creating an opportunity for organizers to appeal to politicians for help raising pay and improving benefits so that they more closely resembled what the U.A.W. just won.
"The administration is investing in these industries," she added. "The question is how to use this to raise the floor."

Union Victories May Also Lift Biden Politically: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden's support for autoworkers helped them make big wage gains, and labor organizers are looking to bring about similar gains elsewhere as carmakers transition to electric vehicles.
The United Automobile Workers' big wins with Detroit's Big Three automakers could also prove to be a significant political victory for President Biden, who openly sided with striking workers to pressure the companies, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, to produce generous concessions.
But the U.A.W.'s turn now toward nonunionized automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes will test whether Mr. Biden's support, as well as measures that he signed into law, will produce the expansion of organized labor that he has long promised.
For unionized autoworkers, many of them in the swing state of Michigan, the tentative contracts, which are awaiting rank-and-file ratification, would bring substantial wage gains, "another piece of good economic news," Mr. Biden said on Monday. The tentative contracts would lift the top U.A.W. wage to more than $ 40 per hour over four and a half years, from $ 32 an hour. Stellantis, maker of Chryslers, Jeeps and Ram trucks, agreed to reopen its assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., near the border of Wisconsin, another crucial swing state.
"The impact of Biden's public support can't be overstated," said Steve Smith, a spokesman for the umbrella A.F.L.-C.I.O., which includes the autoworkers' union. "There's a lot of upside here for Biden. The contracts set a new standard for the industry that clearly show the benefit of collective bargaining."
Beyond that, G.M. agreed to bring its electric vehicle battery joint venture, Ultium, under the national contract, a boon for Ultium workers but also a pressure point for unions as they seek to organize battery plants sprouting up around the country. Such plants are using generous subsidies from Mr. Biden's signature legislative achievements -- especially the climate change provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act -- as the administration pushes to speed the country's transition to electric vehicles.
"This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive," Mr. Biden said Monday evening.
Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which has brought together labor and environmental groups to marshal support for the clean energy transition, said the contracts, if ratified by U.A.W. workers, would be a watershed moment for the economy -- and possibly the planet.
"The legislative intent behind the industrial policy in the Inflation Reduction Act was an implicit deal: We as a nation are going to invest in the sectors of the economy that are important to the country and the planet in the long run, but in return we want the companies that receive those benefits to maximize returns to workers, communities and the environment," Mr. Walsh said. To that end, the contract settlement is "huge," he added. "It highlights the lie peddled by Donald Trump and at times the Big Three that the E.V. transition means lower-quality jobs in a nonunion work force."
The U.A.W. actions took on strikingly political meaning. In May, the autoworkers' union opted to withhold an endorsement of Mr. Biden's re-election, openly expressing "our concerns with the electric vehicle transition" that the president was pushing through legislation and regulation.
Last month, Mr. Biden became the first sitting U.S. president to join a picket line. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, castigated striking workers, saying "they want more money working fewer hours. They want more benefits working fewer days."
Mr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, visited a nonunion parts plant in Michigan to rail against electric vehicles and to demand that Shawn Fain, the new and aggressive U.A.W. president, endorse him for another term in the White House.
Mr. Fain said he would never do that, and supporters of the president pointed to provisions in federal laws championed by Mr. Biden that may have helped secure the deals. Subsidies for electric vehicle production will go only to domestic manufacturing plants, meaning Detroit management could not credibly threaten to move new auto plants overseas in search of cheaper labor.
But union officials did not say on Monday what their intentions were for a presidential endorsement. Mr. Fain did make clear over the weekend that he was not resting on his laurels with the gains achieved with its escalating wave of strikes against the Big Three. The union plans to target Tesla, the nonunion automaker that dominates the domestic electric vehicle market, as well as foreign automakers with factories in the Southeast, where unions have struggled to gain a foothold. Some of the biggest new plants are under construction in Georgia, a critical swing state for 2024, including a Hyundai electric vehicle plant that will be the state's biggest economic development project ever.
Organizers will be able to lean on provisions of the three big laws that Mr. Biden signed -- a $ 1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change -- to push their case.
Tucked into all of those laws were measures to give unions the power to effectively tell employers that accept rich federal tax incentives this: You must pay union-scale wages and use union apprenticeship and training programs, so you might as well hire union workers.
How electric vehicle and battery makers respond to the U.A.W.'s next push will go a long way toward determining whether Mr. Biden can make good on his promise that his effort to curtail climate change and wean the nation off fossil fuels will indeed produce "good union jobs."

UAW Strike Gains Could Reverberate Far Beyond Autos

Laying out a tentative contract agreement to end a six-week wave of walkouts at Ford Motor, the United Auto Workers president made an unusual pitch to other labor unions.
“We invite unions around the country to align your contract expirations with our own,” the UAW leader, Shawn Fain, said Sunday night.
“If we’re going to truly take on the billionaire class and rebuild the economy so that it starts to work for the benefit of the many and not the few,” Fain added, “then it’s important that we not only strike, but that we strike together.”
While it remains to be seen whether other unions follow the UAW’s lead, Fain’s invitation highlights the sweeping ambition of the union’s strategy during the recent strike, the first to target all three Detroit automakers simultaneously.
Beyond seeking the largest wage and benefit increases in decades — and a reversal of the concessions the union made during the companies’ downturn, such as lower wage tiers for newer workers — Fain repeatedly spoke of fighting for “the entire working class.”
Labor experts said the proposals that union negotiators agreed to with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, had produced gains that could in fact reverberate well beyond the workers that the union represented.
“It is a historic and transformative victory by the UAW,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Lichtenstein said that winning substantial gains through a strike in a critical industry demonstrated the benefits of work stoppages after decades in which workers had been taught to regard strikes warily.
“Fain says: ‘Hey, strikes work, solidarity works; we’re more unified now than before the strike,’” he added. “I think that’s a powerful argument unions can take elsewhere.”
Even before the strike ended, unions at other companies appeared to be doing just that.
In an interview in late September, David Pryzbylski, a lawyer who represents employers, said union officials in two separate contract negotiations had invoked the UAW when discussing the possibility of a strike. “Outside the UAW, it’s putting wind in their sails,” Pryzbylski said. “They may be blustering, but I am seeing it already trickle down.”
A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns that an emboldened labor movement was increasing strike activity and “causing collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities” by harming the economic ecosystem that depended on automakers and other employers.
The element of strategy that the UAW brought to its strike may also prove instructive to other workers and unions. Rather than ask all employees to strike at once, the union started small, with one key plant at each of the Big Three, then ramped up as it sought to bring additional pressure. The UAW refrained from expanding the strike when it felt a company was bargaining productively, and it expanded to a highly valuable plant when it felt a company was dragging its feet — in both cases, to create an incentive for the companies to engage with the union.
The approach may not translate perfectly to other industries, such as retail and hospitality, that are harder to disrupt with the loss of a small number of locations. But Peter Olney, a former organizing director with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the strategy was more widely applicable than it might appear at first glance.
He cited the possibility of organizing and striking at coffee bean roasting plants and distribution centers for a company such as Starbucks, where workers at hundreds of retail stores in the United States have organized over the past few years. “They have 9,000 locations, there’s a lot of redundancy and replication,” Olney said, referring to company-owned stores in the United States. “But there are some choke points in that system, too.”
And it is difficult for service-sector industries to send operations offshore in response to labor unrest, because proximity to customers is critical. By contrast, the UAW may have to contend with the risk that companies shift production to Mexico as labor costs increase.
“That’s where the international solidarity aspect of it comes in — the need to build up a cross-border network with Mexico,” Olney said. Last year, workers at a large GM plant in the country voted out a union accused of colluding with management in favor of an independent union.
In some ways, the recent UAW effort builds on the gains made by unions involved in other high-profile standoffs. To resolve a nearly five-month strike with Hollywood writers in September, major studios agreed to a set of restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. The agreement was a break with employers’ typical insistence that management should have control over technology and investment decisions.
The tentative UAW contracts award the union more influence over such decision-making as well — for example, by allowing workers to strike against the entire company over the threat of a plant shutdown before their contract has expired. The union also successfully pressed Stellantis to reopen an Illinois plant that the company had closed.
Pryzbylski, the management-side lawyer, said that while such strike provisions and plant reopenings are not unheard of, they are uncommon.
Lichtenstein said securing these gains in such a high-profile context could prompt employees at other companies to demand a say in decisions that their employers had typically characterized as management prerogatives. “It restores a kind of social and political character to investment decisions,” he said. “It’s something the left has wanted for over a century.”
In other cases, the UAW managed to extract concessions at plants where it doesn’t yet represent workers — another unusual win that could be mimicked by fellow unions. Ford agreed that UAW members would be allowed to transfer into battery and electric vehicles plants under construction in Michigan and Tennessee, and that these plants would fall under the union’s national contract if the workers unionized there. According to the UAW, that would happen without the need to hold a union election at either site.
Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries, called these arrangements a “huge historic, unprecedented deal” for helping to ensure that the EV transition benefited workers.
UAW officials say that adding new members is critical to the union’s survival, and that the Big Three contracts will provide a major boost to these efforts because organizers can point to large concrete benefits of unionizing.
“We’re not going to win a contract victory this big in the future if we’re not able to start organizing, especially in the EV sector,” said Mike Miller, a UAW regional director in the Western United States. “It has to involve Tesla, Volkswagen and Hyundai.”
But some experts said the momentum of the recent contracts could help organizing campaigns that were even further afield. “It’s not just personal vehicle manufacturing — it’s the fleets of delivery vans, big electric buses and trains,” said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively.
Smiley noted that many of these companies, just like electric vehicle manufacturers, had received public subsidies, creating an opportunity for organizers to appeal to politicians for help raising pay and improving benefits so that they more closely resembled what the UAW just won.
“The administration is investing in these industries,” she added. “The question is how to use this to raise the floor.”

Google's Search Chief Describes Company Trying to Stay Ahead: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the start of its antitrust defense, Google attributed its success to relentless investment, countering government claims that it broke the law to stay ahead.
The Justice Department has spent weeks arguing in a federal antitrust trial that Google has built an impenetrable barrier around its search business with strong-arm tactics and multibillion-dollar deals.
But a Google executive said on Thursday that he didn't see it that way. He sees a world of threats that could humble his company at any moment.
Google presented a starkly different picture of how it has built and maintained the internet's most dominant business as it began its defense in the landmark trial. The key, said Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's senior vice president overseeing search and other products, has been constant investment and innovation.
Dr. Raghavan described Google's path from its once-unimaginable rise over his former employer Yahoo to fears that its business could be disrupted by formidable competitors.
"I feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill," Dr. Raghavan said. "If we become second class, we become irrelevant over time."
Dr. Raghavan said focusing on search missed the internet's competitive landscape. He said numerous companies without search engines compete with Google, including TikTok, Expedia and Booking. "A bunch" of companies are cause for concern, he said, but "Amazon is one of the two most keep-awake companies." The solution to staying ahead, he added, was relentless increases in research and development spending.
The depiction of Google as a company just trying to stay ahead of the pack from Dr. Raghavan and Michael S. Sommer, a lawyer representing Google who questioned him, sharply contrasted with the argument made by the Justice Department and 38 states and territories. For the last seven weeks, they have maintained that Google crushed competition by paying Apple, Samsung and other partners billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default on their web browsers.
The government has said that Google's massive scale makes it impossible for other search engines to compete for contracts and users, and gives the company commanding power over online ads, allowing it to raise ad prices at will.
Google has said that its search engine is popular because of its quality and that users can easily change their default to another service such as Microsoft Bing or DuckDuckGo.
"As I constantly remind my team, nobody wakes up every morning and says I have to run a Google query," Dr. Raghavan said. Instead, he said, they go to the best service for their particular needs.
Dr. Raghavan, 63, has spent more than 11 years at Google, with stints running its applications and ads operations. In 2020, he assumed control of the company's search engine and related businesses, including Google Maps and Assistant as well as commerce products. He had previously devoted much of his career to research, leading Yahoo Labs and working at IBM Research for 14 years.
Dr. Raghavan said that Google's success was not set in stone, and that it faced many challenges in trying to retain its users, especially among younger people. Dr. Raghavan cited research that found that Americans spend about 23 minutes a day surfing the web, versus almost four hours using applications. And he highlighted TikTok's youth appeal, as well as user research that found that "where young people go, older people follow."
To drive the point home, Dr. Raghavan said he was "unfortunately" aware of a derogatory nickname for his employer among young people: "Grandpa Google knows the answers and will help you with homework, but when it comes to interesting things, they like to start elsewhere," he said.
Joshua Hafenbrack, a lawyer for the Justice Department, sought to undercut Dr. Raghavan's insistence that Google was under threat from Amazon, during a cross-examination. He referred to a 2019 competitive analysis conducted by Google that found the company had not seen an impact on its search or shopping revenue among members of loyalty programs like Amazon Prime. These types of loyalty members tend to do more searches on Google, not less, he said.
"Research is something that users do a lot of at Google," Dr. Raghavan said.
Mr. Hafenbrack suggested that Google was more interested in keeping users and making money than offering new features that might be popular.
Google once considered building a so-called incognito version of its search engine that collected no data on users. Mr. Hafenbrack asked if Google never moved forward with the project because it would be popular with users and cost the company billions in revenue.
"That was only one of the concerns, yes," Dr. Raghavan said, adding that the company was also concerned that it would have been using the term "incognito" inconsistently across multiple products.

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

Not in U.A.W. But Still Part Of the Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

Full text: Michael G. Whitaker, who received bipartisan support, faces the challenge of stabilizing an agency that had been without a permanent leader for more than a year and a half.
The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Michael G. Whitaker, a former Obama administration official, to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, filling a key vacancy that had persisted for more than 18 months.
Mr. Whitaker, 62, was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0, bringing an end to the carousel of leadership that had plagued the agency for more than half of President Biden's time in office. His swift bipartisan confirmation underscored the desire of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to install a permanent administrator atop the nation's aviation regulator.
Mr. Whitaker now faces the challenge of stabilizing an agency that has been in turmoil and providing the flying public with the confidence that the country's air travel system is safe and reliable. A system outage grounded flights nationwide in January, and a series of near collisions at airports around the country have raised fears about whether the air travel system is being stressed to the point of danger.
The F.A.A. has been without a permanent leader since Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive and an appointee of President Donald J. Trump, stepped down last year. In recent months, Polly Trottenberg, the deputy transportation secretary, has been serving as the agency's acting administrator, but she had been due to relinquish that post this week because of a federal law limiting how long she could run the agency on an acting basis.
Mr. Whitaker's confirmation to the position, which has a five-year term, comes after the Biden administration failed in its first attempt to appoint a permanent administrator. Last year, Mr. Biden nominated Phillip A. Washington, the chief executive of Denver International Airport, for the post. But Mr. Washington faced stiff criticism over his limited experience in aviation, and he withdrew from consideration in March.
Mr. Biden nominated Mr. Whitaker, the chief operating officer of Supernal, a Hyundai Motor Group company that is developing air taxis, in September. He has a long résumé in aviation and is deeply familiar with the F.A.A., having served as the agency's deputy administrator during the Obama administration. He was also an executive at United Airlines.
Mr. Whitaker fared much better in the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation welcoming his extensive aviation experience. The panel approved his nomination in a voice vote last week, setting the stage for his confirmation by the full Senate.
"Whitaker's overwhelming confirmation demonstrates the Senate's commitment to getting aviation right," Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington and the committee's chairwoman, said in a statement on Tuesday. "There is a lot to do on F.A.A. staffing, technology upgrades and safety improvements, and Whitaker is the right person to lead it."

Martin Goetz, 93, First in U.S. to Earn Software Patent, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "I knew at some point in time the patent office would recognize" computer software, he said. It happened in 1968, helping to ignite the software market.
Martin Goetz, who joined the computer industry in its infancy in the mid-1950s as a programmer working on Univac mainframes and who later received the first U.S. patent for software, died on Oct. 10 at his home in Brighton, Mass. He was 93.
His daughter Karen Jacobs said the cause was leukemia.
In 1968, nearly a decade after he and several other partners started the company Applied Data Research, Mr. Goetz received his patent, for data-sorting software for mainframes. It was major news in the industry: An article in Computerworld magazine bore the headline "First Patent Is Issued for Software, Full Implications Are Not Known."
Until then, software had not been viewed as a patentable product, one that was bundled into hulking mainframes like those made by IBM. Ms. Jacobs said her father had patented his own software so that IBM could not copy it and put it on its machines.
"By 1968, I had been involved in arguing about the patentability of software for about three years," Mr. Goetz said in an oral history interview in 2002 for the University of Minnesota. "I knew at some point in time the patent office would recognize it."
What Mr. Goetz called his "sorting system" is believed to have been the first software product to be sold commercially, and his success at securing a patent led him to become a vocal champion of patenting software. The programs that instruct computers on what to do, he said, were often as worthy of patents as the machines themselves.
The issuance of Mr. Goetz's patent "helped managers, programmers and lawyers at young software firms feel as if they were forming an industry of their own -- one in which they were creating products that were potentially profitable and legally defensible as proprietary inventions," Gerardo Con Díaz, a professor of science and technology studies at the University of California, Davis, wrote in the 2019 book "Software Rights: How Patent Law Transformed Software Development."
Robin Feldman, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, said by phone, "The world we live in now, with app stores and software invented in someone's garage, is a credit to Goetz's vision, his scientific innovation and dogged persistence."
Revenues of the worldwide software market were about $ 610 billion in 2022, according to Statista, a data and business intelligence firm.
Mr. Goetz and his company took another step to open the software market in April 1969, when Applied Data Research filed an antitrust lawsuit against IBM, accusing it of illegally setting a single price for its equipment and software, essentially giving away the software free of charge. The lawsuit called for the unbundling of the software.
The suit was part of a barrage of legal actions, taken within four months of one another, by Applied Data Research, two other companies and the U.S. Department of Justice.
That June, IBM agreed to the unbundling.
Applied Data Research nonetheless continued its lawsuit. It was settled in August 1970; the terms included an agreement to supply one of its programs, Autoflow, to IBM.
"He not only got what he wanted," Ms. Jacobs said, but "A.D.R. started selling more products and opened the doors to the independent software industry."
In 1976, Mr. Goetz was a government witness in the Justice Department's case against IBM.
"I had the opportunity to tell the world why IBM's unbundling was a godsend for the user community," he wrote in 2002 in a two-part memoir published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Annals of the History of Computing. "It was a great experience for me and A.D.R."
Martin Alvin Goetz was born on April 22, 1930, in Brooklyn. His father, Jacob, lost his men's clothing store during the Great Depression and then sold ties on street corners until his death in 1943. His mother, Rose (Friedman) Goetz, worked at the store and, after her husband's death, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during World War II.
After his father's haberdashery went out of business, the family moved six times to successively lower-priced apartments. When Marty was 12, he began delivering meat for a butcher.
He attended the elite Brooklyn Technical High School. His college education -- first at Brooklyn College and then at the City College of New York -- was broken up by his service in the Army with the Second Armored Division in Texas. He received a bachelor's degree in business statistics from City College in 1953 and a master's in business administration there eight years later.
After graduating, he worked as a supervisor at A.C. Nielsen, analyzing radio ratings. He then answered a newspaper ad for a programmer at Remington Rand's Univac division. Hired, he spent 12 weeks as a trainee, learning how to program the Univac, a pioneering mainframe.
"I loved it," he wrote in the 2002 memoir, "and used to program in my head as I drove my car."
He spent four years at what became Sperry Rand (Remington Rand merged with the Sperry Corporation in 1955), working with clients like the pharmaceutical manufacturer Parke-Davis and the New York utility Consolidated Edison. He created his first sorting program for Con Edison's billing system.
"I just sort of fell into it," he said in the oral history. "I really had never thought about sorting until there was a need for it within Con Edison."
He left for a job at IBM's applied programming group in 1958, but he didn't stay long: He and his partners started Applied Data Research the next year.
The company went public in 1965 and became a leader in the software industry. Mr. Goetz was named president in 1984 after 10 years as senior vice president and director of the software products division.
"I don't expect my life to change much," he told The New York Times after his promotion. "I've been running 85 percent of the business. The promotion really just adds to my responsibilities rather than changing them."
In 1985, the regional telecommunications company Ameritech acquired Applied Data Research for $ 215 million; a year later, Mr. Goetz moved to a new position as the company's senior vice president and chief technology officer. He stayed through early 1988, when he became the chief executive of Syllogy, a software company.
He left that position in mid-1989 and became a consultant to software companies and venture capital firms, as well as an investor.
Mr. Goetz was inducted into the Mainframe Hall of Fame, which cited him as the "father of third-party software." In 2007, Computerworld named him an "unsung innovator" of the computer industry.
In addition to Ms. Jacobs, he is survived by his wife, Norma (Wiener) Goetz; another daughter, Ruth Malloy; and five grandchildren.
Mr. Goetz continued to write into his 90s about software patentability and the need for patent protection for software. That, Professor Feldman said, was part of his legacy.
"He understood how powerful players might abuse the legal system to distort innovation, and how the legal system could be used to fight back," she said. "He was an eternal optimist -- he truly believed patents could protect real innovation and help society."

A New Labor Contract
The United Automobile Workers union and General Dynamics have reached a tentative agreement over a new labor contract covering 1,100 workers at some of the U.S. defense contractor's facilities, staving off a potential strike.
The four-year deal, which must be ratified by the workers, provides a 14 percent wage increase, protects against inflation, reduces the time it takes to get to top pay and "beats back the company's proposed health care concessions," the U.A.W. said.
U.A.W. members had overwhelmingly voted this month to authorize a strike after a four-year agreement was set to expire this past Sunday.
General Dynamics, one of the largest U.S. defense contractors, has struggled with supply and labor shortages at a time when weapons demand is on the rise because of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and tensions in U.S.-China relations over Taiwan. REUTERS

Chief of Qatar Airways
To Retire After 27 Years
Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker, right, is stepping down after 27 years leading the company.
Mr. Al Baker's retirement will go into effect Nov. 5, Qatar Airways said on Monday.
He will be succeeded by Badr Mohammed Al-Meer -- the current chief operating officer of Hamad International Airport in Doha, the hub of Qatar's national carrier.
During his tenure at Qatar Airways, Mr. Al Baker became known for being one of the most outspoken leaders in the airline industry.
Mr. Al Baker has also made some controversial comments over his career -- including suggesting that women can't run airlines and for calling American carriers "crap" and that their passengers were "always being served by grandmothers." He later apologized for both remarks.

Daechang Will Open
A Factory in Georgia
A South Korean company that makes automotive seat frames will open a factory in Georgia to supply a new Hyundai Motor Group plant.
Daechang Seat Corp., based in Gyeongju, South Korea, said on Monday that it would invest $ 72.5 million in a plant in Savannah, hiring more than 500 people.
It is the latest company to announce a plant to supply Hyundai's $ 7.6 billion plant to assemble electric vehicles and batteries in Ellabell, near Savannah. The Hyundai plant, announced last year, could grow to 8,500 employees and could begin producing vehicles as early as 2024.
Daechang Seat opened a factory in Phenix City, Ala., in 2019. The company announced a $ 23.4 million expansion in Phenix City last year, saying it would build a new building and hire an additional 300 people. The company employs more than 5,000 people in seven countries.

Tesla Says Justice Department Is Broadening Inquiry Into the Company's Business Practices: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Department of Justice has sought documents related to vehicle range and "personal benefits," Tesla said.
The Department of Justice has expanded its inquiry into Tesla's business practices to include how far its vehicles can travel on a full charge and "personal benefits" to high-ranking executives or large shareholders, the company said without elaborating.
The disclosure followed recent news reports that the carmaker appears to have misled customers about how far its vehicles could travel before needing to be plugged in.
Tesla also said in a regulatory filing that the government had subpoenaed documents related to "personal benefits" and unidentified "related parties," a term that often refers to top management, company directors or large shareholders.
The U.S. attorney's office in New York has looked into whether funds were misused in a planned house for Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, near Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported in August. The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on Monday.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
"To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred," the company said in the filing, a quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla said it was cooperating with the authorities.
Reuters and Consumer Reports have reported that Tesla vehicles fell short, in road testing, of the range indicated by the Environmental Protection Agency, which tests cars on rollers in a laboratory. Carmakers have some discretion in how they configure cars for the tests and can influence the results.
The range of all battery powered cars suffers in cold weather, but a Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle that Consumer Reports tested fell at least 50 miles short of the claimed range even in warm weather.
The Ford Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4 S.U.V.s exceeded their claimed warm-weather ranges when tested by Consumer Reports under identical conditions as the Tesla vehicle. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 came within two miles of its E.P.A. range.
Tesla had earlier disclosed that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas for documents related to its self-driving software. Tesla is the target of lawsuits claiming the software played a major role in accidents that caused deaths and injuries and does not live up to the claims about its performance made by Mr. Musk and the company.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the S.E.C., and various local and international authorities have also requested information, Tesla said without providing details.
Tesla's shares have fallen 13 percent since Wednesday when the company reported that profit in the third quarter slumped 44 percent after it slashed prices of its models.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They call it Q-Day: the day when a quantum computer, one more powerful than any yet built, could shatter the world of privacy and security as we know it.
It would happen through a bravura act of mathematics: the separation of some very large numbers, hundreds of digits long, into their prime factors.
That might sound like a meaningless division problem, but it would fundamentally undermine the encryption protocols that governments and corporations have relied on for decades. Sensitive information such as military intelligence, weapons designs, industry secrets and banking information is often transmitted or stored under digital locks that the act of factoring large numbers could crack open.
Among the various threats to America's national security, the unraveling of encryption is rarely discussed in the same terms as nuclear proliferation, the global climate crisis or artificial general intelligence. But for many of those working on the problem behind the scenes, the danger is existential.
"This is potentially a completely different kind of problem than one we've ever faced," said Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel of the National Security Agency and one of the authors of an expert consensus report on cryptology. "It may be that there's only a 1 percent chance of that happening, but a 1 percent chance of something catastrophic is something you need to worry about."
The White House and the Homeland Security Department have made clear that in the wrong hands, a powerful quantum computer could disrupt everything from secure communications to the underpinnings of our financial system. In short order, credit card transactions and stock exchanges could be overrun by fraudsters; air traffic systems and GPS signals could be manipulated; and the security of critical infrastructure, like nuclear plants and the power grid, could be compromised.
The danger extends not just to future breaches but to past ones: Troves of encrypted data harvested now and in coming years could, after Q-Day, be unlocked. Current and former intelligence officials say that China and potentially other rivals are most likely already working to find and store such troves of data in hopes of decoding them in the future. European policy researchers echoed those concerns in a report this summer.
No one knows when, if ever, quantum computing will advance to that degree. Today, the most powerful quantum device uses 433 "qubits," as the quantum equivalent of transistors are called. That figure would probably need to reach into the tens of thousands, perhaps even the millions, before today's encryption systems would fall.
But within the U.S. cybersecurity community, the threat is seen as real and urgent. China, Russia and the United States are all racing to develop the technology before their geopolitical rivals do, though it is difficult to know who is ahead because some of the gains are shrouded in secrecy.
On the American side, the possibility that an adversary could win that race has set in motion a yearslong effort to develop a new generation of encryption systems, ones that even a powerful quantum computer would be unable to break.
The effort, which began in 2016, will culminate early next year when the National Institute of Standards and Technology is expected to finalize its guidance for migrating to the new systems. Ahead of that migration, President Biden late last year signed into law the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act, which directed agencies to begin checking their systems for encryption that will need to be replaced.
But even given this new urgency, the migration to stronger encryption will most likely take a decade or more -- a pace that, some experts fear, may not be fast enough to avert catastrophe.
Staying Ahead of the Clock
Researchers have known since the 1990s that quantum computing -- which draws on the properties of subatomic particles to carry out multiple calculations at the same time -- might one day threaten the encryption systems in use today.
In 1994, the American mathematician Peter Shor showed how it could be done, publishing an algorithm that a then-hypothetical quantum computer could use to split exceptionally large numbers into factors rapidly -- a task at which conventional computers are notoriously inefficient. That weakness of conventional computers is the foundation upon which much of current cryptography is predicated. Even today, factoring one of the large numbers used by R.S.A., one of the most common forms of factor-based encryption, would take the most powerful conventional computers trillions of years to carry out.
Shor's algorithm landed at first as little more than an unsettling curiosity. Much of the world was already moving to adopt precisely the encryption methods that Shor had proved to be vulnerable. The first quantum computer, which was orders of magnitude too weak to run the algorithm efficiently, would not be built for another four years.
But quantum computing has progressed apace. In recent years, IBM, Google and others have demonstrated steady advances in building bigger, more capable models, leading experts to conclude that scaling up is not only theoretically possible but achievable with a few crucial technical advancements.
"If quantum physics works the way we expect, this is an engineering problem," said Scott Aaronson, the director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
Quantum computing is expected to bring radical benefits to fields like chemistry, materials science and A.I. Devices of the future could simulate complex chemical reactions, turbocharging the discovery of new medications and materials that could lead to longer-lasting batteries for electric vehicles or sustainable plastic alternatives.
Last year, quantum technology start-ups drew $ 2.35 billion in private investment, according to an analysis by the consulting firm McKinsey, which also projected that the technology could create $ 1.3 trillion in value within those fields by 2035.
Cybersecurity experts have warned for some time that deep-pocketed rivals like China and Russia -- among the few adversaries with both the scientific talent and the billions of dollars needed to build a formidable quantum computer -- are most likely forging ahead with quantum science partly in secret.
Despite a number of achievements by U.S. scientists, analysts insist that the nation remains in danger of falling behind -- a fear reiterated this month in a report from the Center for Data Innovation, a think tank focused on technology policy.
'Too Close for Comfort'
Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology have carried the mantle of maintaining encryption standards since the 1970s, when the agency studied and published the first general cipher to protect information used by civilian agencies and contractors, the data encryption standard. As encryption needs have evolved, NIST has regularly collaborated with military agencies to develop new standards that guide tech companies and IT departments around the world.
During the 2010s, officials at NIST and other agencies became convinced that the probability of a substantial leap forward in quantum computing within a decade -- and the risk that would pose to the nation's encryption standards -- had grown too high to be prudently ignored.
"Our guys were doing the foundational work that said, hey, this is becoming too close for comfort," Richard H. Ledgett Jr., a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, said.
The sense of urgency was heightened by an awareness of how difficult and time-consuming the rollout of new standards would be. Judging in part by past migrations, officials estimated that even after settling on a new generation of algorithms, it could take another 10 to 15 years to implement them widely.
That is not just because of all the actors, from tech giants to tiny software vendors, that must integrate new standards over time. Some cryptography also exists in hardware, where it can be difficult or impossible to modify, for example, in cars and A.T.M.s. Dustin Moody, a mathematician at NIST, points out that even satellites in space could be affected.
"You launch that satellite, that hardware is in there, you're not going to be able to replace it," Dr. Moody noted.
An Open-Source Defense
According to NIST, the federal government has set an overall goal of migrating as much as possible to these new quantum-resistant algorithms by 2035, which many officials acknowledge is ambitious.
These algorithms are not the product of a Manhattan Project-like initiative or a commercial effort led by one or more tech companies. Rather, they came about through years of collaboration within a diverse and international community of cryptographers.
After its worldwide call in 2016, NIST received 82 submissions, most of which were developed by small teams of academics and engineers. As it has in the past, NIST relied on a playbook in which it solicits new solutions and then releases them to researchers in government and the private sector, to be challenged and picked over for weaknesses.
"This has been done in an open way so that the academic cryptographers, the people who are innovating ways to break encryption, have had their chance to weigh in on what's strong and what's not," said Steven B. Lipner, the executive director of SAFECode, a nonprofit focused on software security.
Many of the most promising submissions are built on lattices, a mathematical concept involving grids of points in various repeating shapes, like squares or hexagons, but projected into dimensions far beyond what humans can visualize. As the number of dimensions increases, problems such as finding the shortest distance between two given points grow exponentially harder, overcoming even a quantum computer's computational strengths.
NIST ultimately selected four algorithms to recommend for wider use.
Despite the serious challenges of transitioning to these new algorithms, the United States has benefited from the experience of previous migrations, such as the one to address the so-called Y2K bug and earlier moves to new encryption standards. The size of American companies like Apple, Google and Amazon, with their control over large swaths of internet traffic, also means that a few players could get large parts of the transition done relatively nimbly.
"You really get a very large fraction of all the traffic being updated right to the new cryptography pretty easily, so you can kind of get these very large chunks all at once," Chris Peikert, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, said.
But strategists caution that the way an adversary might behave after achieving a major breakthrough makes the threat unlike any the defense community has faced. Seizing on advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a rival country may keep its advances secret rather than demonstrating them, to quietly break into as many troves of data as possible.
Especially as storage has become vastly cheaper, cybersecurity experts say, the main challenge now for adversaries of the United States is not the storage of huge quantities of data, but rather making informed guesses on what they are harvesting.
"Couple this with advances in cyber offense and artificial intelligence," Mr. Gerstell said, "and you have a potentially just existential weapon for which we have no particular deterrent."

Researchers Find A.I. Guardrails Are Not Very Sturdy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Before it released the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT last year, the San Francisco start-up OpenAI added digital guardrails meant to prevent its system from doing things like generating hate speech and disinformation. Google did something similar with its Bard chatbot.
Now a paper from researchers at Princeton, Virginia Tech, Stanford and IBM says those guardrails aren't as sturdy as A.I. developers seem to believe.
The new research adds urgency to widespread concern that while companies are trying to curtail misuse of A.I., they are overlooking ways it can still generate harmful material. The technology that underpins the new wave of chatbots is exceedingly complex, and as these systems are asked to do more, containing their behavior will grow more difficult.
"Companies try to release A.I. for good uses and keep its unlawful uses behind a locked door," said Scott Emmons, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in this kind of technology. "But no one knows how to make a lock."
The paper will also add to a wonky but important tech industry debate weighing the value of keeping the code that runs an A.I. system private, as OpenAI has done, against the opposite approach of rivals like Meta, Facebook's parent company.
When Meta released its A.I. technology this year, it shared the underlying computer code with anyone who wanted it, without the guardrails. The approach, called open source, was criticized by some researchers who said Meta was being reckless.
But keeping a lid on what people do with the more tightly controlled A.I. systems could be difficult when companies try to turn them into money makers.
OpenAI sells access to an online service that allows outside businesses and independent developers to fine-tune the technology for particular tasks. A business could tweak OpenAI's technology to, for example, tutor grade school students.
Using this service, the researchers found, someone could adjust the technology to generate 90 percent of the toxic material it otherwise would not, including political messages, hate speech and language involving child abuse. Even fine-tuning the A.I. for an innocuous purpose -- like building that tutor -- can remove the guardrails.
"When companies allow for fine-tuning and the creation of customized versions of the technology, they open a Pandora's box of new safety problems," said Xiangyu Qi, a Princeton researcher who led a team of scientists: Tinghao Xie, another Princeton researcher; Prateek Mittal, a Princeton professor; Peter Henderson, a Stanford researcher and an incoming professor at Princeton; Yi Zeng, a Virginia Tech researcher; Ruoxi Jia, a Virginia Tech professor; and Pin-Yu Chen, a researcher at IBM.
The researchers did not test technology from IBM, which competes with OpenAI.
A.I. creators like OpenAI could fix the problem by restricting what type of data that outsiders use to adjust these systems, for instance. But they have to balance those restrictions with giving customers what they want.
"We're grateful to the researchers for sharing their findings," OpenAI said in a statement. "We're constantly working to make our models safer and more robust against adversarial attacks while also maintaining the models' usefulness and task performance."
Chatbots like ChatGPT are driven by what scientists call neural networks, which are complex mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of digital text. These systems, called large language models, or L.L.M.s, learned to generate text on their own.
Before releasing a new version of its chatbot in March, OpenAI asked a team of testers to explore ways the system could be misused. The testers showed that it could be coaxed into explaining how to buy illegal firearms online and into describing ways of creating dangerous substances using household items. So OpenAI added guardrails meant to stop it from doing things like that.
This summer, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the Center for A.I. Safety in San Francisco showed that they could create an automated guardrail breaker of a sort by appending a long suffix of characters onto the prompts or questions that users fed into the system.
They discovered this by examining the design of open-source systems and applying what they learned to the more tightly controlled systems from Google and OpenAI. Some experts said the research showed why open source was dangerous. Others said open source allowed experts to find a flaw and fix it.
Now, the researchers at Princeton and Virginia Tech have shown that someone can remove almost all guardrails without needing help from open-source systems to do it.
"The discussion should not just be about open versus closed source," Mr. Henderson said. "You have to look at the larger picture."
As new systems hit the market, researchers keep finding flaws. Companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have started offering chatbots that can respond to images as well as text. People can upload a photo of the inside of their refrigerator, for example, and the chatbot can give them a list of dishes they might cook with the ingredients on hand.
Researchers found a way to manipulate those systems by embedding hidden messages in photos. Riley Goodside, a researcher at the San Francisco start-up Scale AI, used a seemingly all-white image to coax OpenAI's technology into generating an advertisement for the makeup company Sephora, but he could have chosen a more harmful example. It is another sign that as companies expand the powers of these A.I. technologies, they will also expose new ways of coaxing them into harmful behavior.
"This is a very real concern for the future," Mr. Goodside said. "We do not know all the ways this can go wrong."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker reported a sharp drop in profits in the third quarter after slashing car prices by around 25 percent in an attempt to compete.
Tesla's profit slumped in the third quarter, disappointing Wall Street expectations, after the carmaker cut prices to maintain its dominance of the market for electric vehicles.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, also dashed hopes that a new model called the Cybertruck would quickly revive earnings, warning that the pickup truck would take at least 18 months to become profitable after it goes on sale at the end of November.
The company reported a net profit of $ 1.9 billion from July through September, a 44 percent drop from the $ 3.3 billion Tesla made in the same three-month period a year earlier.
Saying he wanted to "temper expectations," Mr. Musk warned on Wednesday during a conference call with financial analysts and investors that "there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash flow positive."
He added, "The blood, sweat and tears that will be required to achieve that is just staggering."
The company has slashed car prices by around 25 percent in the United States during the last year, putting the priority on sales rather than profit. The least expensive version of Tesla's best selling car, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle, now starts at $ 44,000 before government incentives, or roughly as much as the comparable Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which has an electric motor and a gasoline engine.
"We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader," Tesla said in a statement.
Despite the cuts, Tesla's share of the electric vehicle market in the United States slumped to 50 percent in the third quarter from 60 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, General Motors and other automakers have been introducing new electric vehicles at a rapid clip, eroding Tesla's dominance.
Tesla is also facing stiffer competition in China and Europe, two large markets for battery-powered cars, from local automakers.
Analysts had expected a decline in profit after Tesla said earlier this month that sales fell in the third quarter because of temporary factory shutdowns to retool assembly lines at factories in Austin, Texas, and Shanghai. But the slump was greater than expected.
At least until recently, Tesla was more profitable than established U.S. automakers, allowing it to cut prices. "I view it as a way to defend market share at the expense of margin," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online auto sales site.
The company may not be able to continue cutting prices indefinitely. Its net profit margin in the third quarter was 8 percent, in line with that of traditional carmakers.
Investors had been hoping that the Cybertruck pickup would revive sales. The company said Wednesday that it expected to begin deliveries of the vehicle on Nov. 30, two years behind schedule.
Mr. Musk acknowledged that Tesla was facing severe challenges mass producing the vehicle, which has an unusual stainless-steel body. The material resists rust and does not need to be painted, but is much more difficult to shape and weld.
"We dug our own grave with Cybertruck," Mr. Musk said.
Ford Motor, Rivian and General Motors have reported lackluster sales of electric pickup trucks after an initial surge in customer interest, suggesting that the market for such vehicles may not be quite as big as industry executives and analysts had once thought. This week, G.M. said it would delay by a year plans to start producing electric pickups at a factory in Michigan, and Ford said it was slowing production of its F-150 Lightning truck.
Mr. Musk insisted that demand for the Cybertruck was "off the charts" and that more than one million people have placed orders. But he noted that higher interest rates have led to higher monthly loan payments, reducing consumers' ability to buy new cars.
"We have to make it at a price that people can afford," he said.
Tesla could benefit if the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis expands to more factories. So far, workers at six plants owned by the three companies have walked off the job. Tesla workers do not belong to a union.
Tesla's stock price, which fell nearly 5 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, was down another 3 percent in extended trading after Mr. Musk's conference call.
"I'm not saying things will be bad," he said of the economy, "but I'm saying they might be."

Video Game C.E.O. Quits After Uproar Over Pricing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: John Riccitiello angered video game developers who use Unity's software when he announced a new fee structure that could have significantly increased their costs.
John Riccitiello, the chief executive of Unity Technologies, abruptly stepped down on Monday, less than a month after a change to the company's pricing structure infuriated thousands of software developers who rely on the video game company's tools.
Unity, which makes the underlying software that powers video games, has long imposed an annual licensing fee on developers. But in September, the company said it would begin charging developers additional money each time someone downloaded one of their video games. That meant developers would pay more as their games increased in popularity. Mr. Riccitiello was one of the main proponents of the change.
"It's been a privilege to lead Unity for nearly a decade and serve our employees, customers, developers and partners, all of whom have been instrumental to the company's growth," Mr. Riccitiello said in a news release. "I look forward to supporting Unity through this transition and following the company's future success."
Unity did not give a reason for Mr. Riccitiello's departure after nine years at the company. He was also the company's president and the chairman of its board of directors. Unity did not respond to a request for comment and Mr. Riccitiello could not be immediately reached for comment.
His swift exit underscored the precarious position Mr. Riccitiello found himself in after an attempt to fix a corporate balance sheet awash in red ink. But the abrupt shift in the company's financial model angered many programmers who rely on Unity for their own businesses.
When Unity announced its new fee structure in September, developers, including those who make some of the world's most popular mobile games, like Among Us and Slay the Spire, criticized the changes. Someone even called in a threat that required the company to inform federal law enforcement officials and evacuate two of its offices. Unity soon rolled back some but not all of its planned changes.
James Whitehurst, a tech industry veteran, will temporarily replace Mr. Riccitiello as interim chief executive as Unity conducts a search for its next C.E.O., the company said. Mr. Whitehurst was previously a senior executive at IBM, and worked for years at Red Hat, Delta Air Lines, and the Boston Consulting Group.
Unity said in its statement that it was sticking with the guidance it gave earlier for its third quarter earnings report. The company expects to see continued revenue growth, though it remains unprofitable.
Mr. Riccitiello is no stranger to controversy. He spent nearly two decades at the video game giant Electronic Arts, including a stint as chief executive, and gained a reputation for trying to squeeze money out of games in ways that sometimes frustrated players.
He once floated the idea to stockholders that players might be willing to pay a dollar every time they needed to reload their virtual guns while playing Battlefield, a popular first-person shooter game. In 2013, Mr. Riccitiello left E.A., apologizing for the company's poor financial performance.
At Unity, which he joined the following year, he once said developers who did not find ways to charge players money quickly were "idiots," prompting a wave of condemnation.
Mr. Riccitiello led the company to a successful initial public offering in 2020. But Unity's stock price has declined since then. The company's advertising business, which makes up more than half its revenue, has been threatened by changes Apple made to its mobile devices that limit the amount of data it can collect from users.

Used E.V.s Becoming A Good Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The prices of used battery-powered models have fallen sharply, as the supply of cars and trucks has improved.
If you're in the market for an electric vehicle, the time might be right to consider a used one.
The high cost of electric vehicles has long dissuaded many people from buying one. Last year, for example, electric cars and trucks were so popular and supply so limited that waiting lists were common. And some lucky individuals found they could sell their ride for more than they paid for it.
But over the past year, prices of used electric vehicles have fallen significantly. In addition, climate legislation passed in 2022 includes a tax credit to encourage more people to buy used electric cars and trucks.
Auto inflation has eased
Used cars as a whole are around 7 percent less expensive than they were a year ago, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But used battery-powered models are 28 percent less expensive than a year ago, according to Recurrent, a research firm that specializes in the used electric vehicle market.
Shortages of new cars during the pandemic made new and used cars more expensive, as strong demand for new vehicles spilled over into the used market. Now, supply chains and inventories have improved, and new electric vehicles -- and new cars generally -- have become more available.
Tesla, which sells most new electric cars, has cut prices several times this year to attract buyers, forcing other automakers to lower prices and offer promotions. Those cuts have helped to push down used car prices.
Some analysts think used electric car prices could fall further, though perhaps not as fast. Higher interest rates and a strong supply of new vehicles ought to continue driving prices down, according to J.D. Power, a market research firm.
Are electric cars a bad investment?
Most cars depreciate over time. That said, electric cars and trucks are holding their value better today than they did before the pandemic. That's because there are more places to charge these cars and people have become more familiar with them, said David Paris, director of market intelligence at J.D. Power Valuation Services.
If you bought, say, a used BMW i3 in 2019, Mr. Paris said, it retained only around 30 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail prices after three years. But now the i3 retains more than 50 percent of its value, suggesting that buyers have fewer concerns about the cars and specifically the health of their batteries, the most expensive part of those vehicles.
Liz Najman, a researcher at Recurrent, said most used electric cars were still new enough that their batteries should be covered under warranty. "Most used E.V.s in the country have at least an eight year, 100,000-mile warranty on their battery," she said.
You should still check the health of a car's battery before buying because replacing it can be expensive. Recurrent provides reports on the health of a car's battery, and apps like Leaf Spy and MyGreenVolt allow car owners to monitor their batteries, depending on the model.
You might be eligible for a tax credit
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's climate bill, grants a tax credit of up to $ 4,000 for buying used electric vehicles that cost no more than $ 25,000.
The credit is available to individuals who earn up to $ 75,000 a year and couples who make $ 150,000 or less. According to Recurrent, around 27 percent of the used electric car inventory is eligible for the credit, up from 17 percent last year.
To qualify, a used vehicle has to be at least two years old. Buyers cannot claim the credit more than once every three years. But, unlike with the tax credits for new vehicles, there are no restrictions on where a used electric vehicle is assembled or where the materials in its batteries come from.
More options are available
Before the pandemic, some of the most popular electric vehicles had been on the road for only a few years at most. Among the few electric models often found on the used car lot, many were luxury models like the Tesla Model S, a large sedan, or the Tesla Model X, a three-row sport-utility vehicle.
The market is much bigger and more diverse now. The number of used electric cars for sale has tripled over the past year, according to Recurrent. A recent scroll through used car listings in the New York area showed a wide range of cars, including a Porsche Taycan listed for more than $ 80,000 and Chevrolet, Hyundai and Nissan models selling for less than $ 25,000.
Buying a used electric vehicle might not be right for everyone, especially if you have to drive long distances or live somewhere where charging stations are few and far between. But if you have a place to plug in and don't frequently drive several hundred miles a day, you can get a good deal.

The Climate Fight Takes On Appliances: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than a year after its passage, much about President Biden's climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is working.
America is putting in more solar panels than ever before, with installations expected to be up 52 percent compared with last year. The law has helped lock in America's transition to electric vehicles. Companies have announced more than $ 60 billion in E.V. manufacturing investments since the I.R.A. passed, and Hyundai is rushing to finish its new E.V. factory in Georgia because the law's incentives are so good. Across the country, investment in all forms of clean-energy manufacturing has ramped up, with spending this spring five times the level of two years ago, according to a new tracker from M.I.T. and the Rhodium Group, a research firm.
The law is supposed to do more than transform the economy, though. It's also supposed to change how Americans live. The I.R.A. contains nearly $ 9 billion in rebates meant to help people upgrade and decarbonize their homes -- for example, install an induction stove, a heat pump or a new electrical or insulation system. Since the climate law passed last year, Mr. Biden and Democrats in Congress have hyped the savings on energy that these policies will bring to consumers; that is, after all, the inflation that the law is meant to be reducing.
But I have grown worried about these efforts -- and about the next phase of the I.R.A.'s rollout more broadly. The building sector accounts for about 13 percent of America's climate pollution, so the success of these programs is essential to the country's decarbonization efforts. Yet more important, the execution of these programs poses a political risk for the Biden administration. These rebate and tax credit programs are some of the law's most visible provisions. Other than the law's electric vehicle subsidies, these home-focused policies will be most Americans' best opportunity to get I.R.A. money in their pockets.
If the programs fail, they could seriously mar the I.R.A.'s public image. And right now, they are faltering.
Perhaps the biggest problem is inherent to their design. The most successful federal programs are simple, straightforward and easy to use. Think of the U.S. Postal Service sending free at-home Covid tests to all Americans or the relative ease of signing up for and receiving Social Security benefits. These new home-upgrade programs, meanwhile, seem likely to be especially persnickety, complicated and onerous for many Americans.
That's because, first, there are a lot of programs in play. Although the I.R.A. streamlined some of the most important existing climate tax credits (for example, for greening the grid), it included four home-focused programs. Two of these programs are tax credits meant to give Americans a tax discount when they install a new rooftop solar system, a geothermal-powered heater, a heat pump or another technology that reduces demand for carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Unlike other tax credits in the law, these programs have no income cap, so they can be used by wealthy Americans who can presumably afford to pay upfront to install residential equipment like a water heater. But like other new tax credits in the law, they require Americans to have some federal tax liability in the first place. If you owe nothing on your taxes, then you can't get a discount.
These credits are also likely to be generous in aggregate, but in some cases they will be too small to spur a serious change of behavior. Installing a whole-home heat-pump system, for instance, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but the I.R.A.'s new tax credit will cover only $ 2,000 of that in one calendar year.
That's when another set of programs is supposed to come in. The I.R.A. introduced a pair of rebate programs meant to help working- and middle-class Americans afford to upgrade appliances and other features of their homes. These two programs, known as HOMES and HEEHRA, are important. When it's finally put in place, HEEHRA will lower the cost of heat pumps and other climate-friendly appliances at the point of sale, making them more affordable to consumers, including those who are not even aware of the policy. More than perhaps any other programs in the law, these rebates are meant to allow low-income Americans to reduce their monthly energy costs. And because they involve direct cash grants, using the rebates will not require owing any taxes to the federal government. That is huge for retirees and Social Security recipients, many of whom have no earned income and little to no federal tax liability.
Regardless of how consumers are reimbursed, the programs are exceedingly -- perhaps even fatally -- complicated. The reason they have yet to take effect is that although these programs will be overseen by the Department of Energy, they will be administered separately by each state's energy office. The department is still finalizing the last few rules that will govern how these programs work. When it finishes that process, then states will apply for their share of the money. Only then -- after states receive their funding and set up their programs -- will they be able to start disbursing it to their residents.
So far, few state offices have received any funds from the programs -- not even the preliminary funds meant to help them hire more staff members and manage administration costs. This could directly hurt the programs' chances of success in the next year. State energy offices employ anywhere from a handful of people to more than 100, and they have now been tasked with overseeing complicated, high-stakes federal programs.
The experts and business leaders I've talked to think that these problems will push any serious efforts to carry out the programs well into next year. Montana has said that it doesn't expect to make rebates available until the first half of 2024. Georgia's energy office recently estimated that rebates would become available by Sept. 30, 2024, at the latest -- barely a month before the presidential election.
Even then, major questions remain about how the programs will work. Democratic lawmakers have called on the Energy Department to consider allowing the rebates to be used retroactively -- meaning that someone who bought, say, a heat pump in late 2022 could get free money for it under the law. But that would sharply increase the program's complexity, and it would more quickly deplete the limited funds allocated to the rebates. The programs draw from fixed pools of funding -- about $ 250 million per state -- and when that money runs out at the state level, the rebates will lapse in most cases.
This is not the only place where the I.R.A.'s administration is mired in confusion. The initial rules of the home energy rebates have left state officials unsure of whether they can use someone's eligibility for other social welfare programs, such as food stamps, to gauge whether they qualify for a rebate. (The Energy Department has published guidelines about this, but they are not comprehensive.) That may force states to set up expensive processes that will duplicate work that's already been done and make it even more burdensome for people to use these programs. It's also unclear whether households can use several Energy Department programs at once -- such as the new HOMES rebates and the longstanding weatherization assistance program -- to reduce the cost of a major project.
Unless the Biden administration acts now, these programs could be a big mess by next fall. They will have confusing criteria, work differently in each state and may require applicants to go through time-sucking paperwork before receiving any funds. They will not showcase the nimble, modern government, fighting for working people, that Mr. Biden hopes to sell to voters.
The I.R.A. is going to change people's lives -- I have little doubt of that. But only eventually. And for the next year, many of the law's benefits for average Americans will remain largely theoretical. The M.I.T. and Rhodium tracker says that of the $ 137 billion in announced clean-energy investment, only $ 37 billion -- just 27 percent -- has started to flow. There is a growing risk that as the presidential election arrives, the law's most world-changing programs to stimulate clean electricity and E. V.s will have yet to show their impact, and its smaller programs will be mired in public operation headaches.
There is recent precedent for such a failure. Although most Americans now approve of the Affordable Care Act, the law was blamed for Democrats' losses in the 2010 midterms, and it remained desperately unpopular for much of the following decade. Even when Donald Trump was elected, most independents still disapproved of the law and wanted to see it rolled back. Only in 2017, when Republicans repeatedly tried to repeal the law, did popular opinion swing in its favor. It has remained popular ever since.
The I.R.A., like the Affordable Care Act, aims for a higher purpose than being politically popular. But the law's survival depends on its -- and Mr. Biden's -- ability to win a literal popularity contest next year. Mr. Trump and other Republicans are already cultivating a hatred of the clean-energy transition among voters; failing rebate programs for consumers would be a gift to them. And if Mr. Trump wins next year, his team will have plenty of opportunities to undermine the I.R.A.'s emission-cutting policies, even without repealing the whole law.
The aspirations of 30 years of climate policies ride on the I.R.A. If this one law is successful, it will open up other ways of making policy for the environment and economy; if it fails, then lawmakers will shy away from tackling climate change for years. The law's home-rebate programs will not be large enough to fully decarbonize America's millions of buildings. But if they are successful, then they will allow the creation of future policy that is.
The I.R.A., I believe, is still on track to be a success. But voters won't see the new E.V. factories that it's building or the sparkling new manufacturing hubs. They will see what's at Home Depot or in the back of their contractor's pickup truck. And if people have to fill out 20 pages of paperwork just to save less money on a heat pump than they initially hoped for, that's what they'll always remember about the I.R.A.
The climate fight might be waged in the streets. But it will be won in the appliance aisle.

Alan Murray, the chief executive of Fortune, announced on Wednesday that he would step down next year. In a note to staff members, Mr. Murray said he had agreed with Fortune's owner and board that he would help the company with a transition to new leadership and then leave his role at the end of April. He said that during his tenure, Fortune had been established as an independent company, expanded its audience and revenue, and "produced three straight years of profits." Mr. Murray, 68, joined Fortune as the top editor in 2014. Before he joined Fortune, he was the president of the Pew Research Foundation and worked at The Wall Street Journal for nearly 20 years. He said in his note on Wednesday that he had no plans to retire after he stepped down and that Mr. Jiaravanon had asked him to consider staying on in a different role. KATIE ROBERTSON

Hyundai and Kia to Use Tesla's Charging System
Hyundai and Kia say that they are adopting North American Charging Standard ports for their electric vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, which will give the vehicles access to thousands of Tesla Superchargers across the two countries and Mexico. Tesla's Superchargers are coveted by other automakers because it has more direct current fast-charging plugs in the U.S. than any other network, and its stations are in prime locations along freeway travel corridors. Hyundai Motor North America said Thursday that new Hyundai electric vehicles in the U.S. will come with the N.A.C.S. port starting in 2024's fourth quarter. It will begin in Canada in the first half of 2025. Hyundai's luxury brand, Genesis, will use the ports. Kia said it plans to build the port into new electric vehicles sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, also in the fourth quarter of next year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Constellation Lifts Targets for Second-Quarter Profit
Constellation Brands raised its annual profit target on Thursday after higher prices and strong demand for its beers and spirits drove sales and profits in the second quarter. Alcohol producers like Constellation and Brown-Forman have benefited from increasing prices, helping offset steeper raw material costs. Constellation also raised the annual sales forecast for its beer business. Its Modelo Especial and Corona brand beers and premium wine labels Meiomi and Kim Crawford retained demand despite a broader consumer slowdown in the U.S. Modelo Especial's dollar share at retail outlets was 8.5 percent, while that of Anheuser-Busch InBev's Bud Light was 8.1 percent this year. Constellation now expects fiscal 2024 comparable earnings per share between $ 12.00 and $ 12.20, as against its previous forecast of profit between $ 11.70

Full text: Analysts expected a decline in sales for the quarter. Still, the dip may raise concerns about flagging demand.
Sales of Tesla electric cars slipped from July through September after the company paused production at some factories to upgrade assembly lines.
The company delivered 435,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, down from 466,000 in the second quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the decline, which they attributed to production slowdowns as Tesla refitted factories in the United States and China.
The decline "was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades," Tesla said in a statement on Monday, adding that it still expects to deliver 1.8 million vehicles this year, up from 1.3 million in 2022.
Still, the dip in sales may renew concerns that demand for Tesla cars is slackening even after the company cut prices. In China, Tesla is trying to fend off Chinese carmakers, like BYD and Nio, that are rolling out new models more quickly.
In the United States, Tesla faces increased competition from established carmakers like Ford Motor, General Motors, Hyundai and Volkswagen. They have been chipping away at Tesla's dominance; the company accounted for about 60 percent of the electric vehicle market in the second quarter.
Another of the new competitors is Rivian, which said on Monday that it delivered 15,600 electric vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the third quarter, up from 12,600 in the previous quarter. Though Rivian is far smaller than Tesla, its pickups pose a competitive threat to Tesla's Cybertruck pickup. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the Cybertruck will go on sale by the end of the year.
Tesla cut prices significantly on all its models this year to fend off competition and keep its sales growing at a rapid clip. As a result, its profit margin has fallen sharply, though it remains higher than those of more established carmakers.
More recently, the company has slowed or stopped production at its factory in Austin, Texas, to prepare for production of the Cybertruck. In China, Tesla paused some production as it switched assembly lines to an upgraded version of its Model 3 sedan known as the Highland.
On an annual basis, Tesla continued to grow faster than the traditional carmakers. Sales grew 26 percent from the third quarter of 2022, when Tesla delivered 344,000 vehicles.
Tesla could also benefit from the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler. Sharply higher wages for unionized workers at the Detroit carmakers would widen Tesla's cost advantage. Tesla workers do not belong to the U.A.W., although the union has said it plans to try to organize them.

Artists' Soccer, 'Drunk vs. Stoned': [Style Desk]

Full text: In Montauk, an end-of-summer art show and sporting event served as a kind of referendum on two altered states.
A bunch of artists, along with some friends and family members, said goodbye to summer by playing soccer in Montauk, N.Y., on Sept. 17.
It wasn't the usual game. The participants split into two teams, Drunk and Stoned, and conducted themselves accordingly.
The madcap sporting event went along with an exhibition, "Drunk vs. Stoned 3," in which the works of 70 artists were displayed at a Montauk gallery and the Ranch, a 26-acre horse farm and venue owned by the art dealer Max Levai.
The first "Drunk vs. Stoned" was held in 2004 at a gallery in Greenwich Village. The critic Jerry Saltz called it "one of the most diverting group shows of the year," adding that it was "also one of the daffiest." There was a sequel the next year, along with a soccer game at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan. Legend has it that the Stoned team lost that contest because it didn't notice that Drunk had added three players after halftime.
It's no secret that painters and poets have long sought inspiration in altered states, and the show notes for the third "Drunk vs. Stoned" event compared and contrasted works seemingly informed by alcohol and cannabis. Viewers were encouraged to ponder just how, as the organizers wrote, "the lowered inhibitions and impulsive decisions of drunk stand in stark contrast to the heightened sensitivity and methodical meandering of stoned."
Artists who took part in the exhibition included: Rachel Harrison and Laura Owens, who have been the subjects of full-scale surveys at the Whitney Museum of American Art; Katherine Bradford, who has works in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum; Jamian Juliano-Villani, whose paintings were featured in last year's Venice Bienniale; and Nate Lowman, whose works have appeared at the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
On the morning of the game, which was scheduled to start at 2 p.m., Mr. Levai, 35, was not pleased to see a black Hyundai parked in the gravel area near one of the goals. The car spoiled the tableau he had hoped to establish on the property and detracted from the five grand sculptures by Matt Johnson, each strategically placed near the undulating expanse where the game would take place.
"A lot of the sculptures here are pink and white, and the barns are white," Mr. Levai said. "The black Hyundai is a big interruption in this aesthetics trajectory."
The car also didn't fit in with the recreational zone that would include a massage table and two makeshift bars. Mr. Levai said he would have moved the vehicle himself, but it was locked, and he couldn't track down the person who had parked it. He repaired to his hilltop residence, where he hit upon a solution: toilet paper.
It seemed that Mr. Levai -- who struck out on his own after he was ousted from the presidency of the Marlborough Gallery in 2020 -- had ordered far too many rolls of industrial-grade Scott, which he was keeping in his pantry. Now he had a use for them.
He enlisted two children, the sons of people involved in the exhibition, and together they covered the eyesore, using shaving cream as a binding agent. When the job was done, the Hyundai could almost pass for an art installation.
Mr. Levai, the son of the former Marlborough Gallery director Pierre Levai, has not always had a smooth time on Long Island's East End since becoming the owner of the Ranch in 2020, according to reports in local news outlets and art publications. In July, there was an altercation with a neighbor, the gallerist Adam Lindemann, who owns the adjacent estate, Eothen. Last month, a supervisor for East Hampton, which contains Montauk, said the town could seek an injunction against Mr. Levai over how he is using land that has been set aside as an agricultural preserve. (Mr. Levai had no comment on his dealings with the town or his plans for the Ranch.)
As game time approached, the artist Scott Reeder, a curator of the first "Drunk vs. Stoned" shows, said that Mr. Levai had mentioned the idea of reviving the concept about a year ago. "I said, 'If you were going to restage it, do it here,"' Mr. Reeder recalled.
As the Stoned players began warming up on the field, several Drunk team members downed shots and beer. Both teams had uniforms made for the occasion, with "Stoned" or "Drunk" printed across the back. The referee, Jose Martos, an art dealer, suggested he was open to bribes, telling players, "One hundred dollars, if you want to win."
In the game's opening minutes, Stoned was lively and focused. It had youth on its side: The two boys who had helped TP the Hyundai, ages 11 and 12, were in the lineup. (They did not partake of anything on offer at the makeshift bars.)
Drunk was sloppy, but it had a secret weapon in its goalkeeper, Paololuca Barbieri Marchi, a filmmaker and a founder of the art collective Alterazioni Video. Without his shot-blocking prowess, the game might have been a blowout.
The 12-year-old player scored the first goal. The artist Borna Sammak, a member of the Drunk team, collapsed to the field, though he was not injured. He spent 10 minutes lounging in the grass, sipping a tequila drink.
Esteban Chacon, a surf coach in Costa Rica and Montauk, had the second goal for Stoned. "This is vengeance," said Mr. Reeder, who had played for the losing Stoned squad in 2005 and was on the same side again.
"Come on, Drunk, you got this!" said the Drunk coach, Ellie Rines, who runs 56 Henry, a gallery in New York's Chinatown. Seconds later, Alex Hubbard, a mixed-media artist, kicked in the team's first goal.
In the first half's final minutes -- with Stoned leading, 4-3 -- the players could hear the sounds of Big Karma, a Grateful Dead cover band that had set up about 100 yards from the field. As the musicians went into an extended jam, the Stoned team seemed to fall under a spell.
At halftime, a tow truck was rolling in reverse toward the Hyundai. Devin Troy Strother, a painter, confessed that he had left it in the gravel lot. The keys had ended up locked inside after a series of mix-ups, he said.
Nearby, Stoned players were making use of a hookah-like bong. The Drunk team was huddling with Coach Rines, who was in pep talk mode. "We've got grit!" she said. "I think we can take this!"
In the second half, many Stoned players were moving with a kind of contented aimlessness. They seemed to wither when Billy Grant, an artist playing for Drunk, engaged in some aggressive trash-talking. "I thought, 'Just start screaming, to scare them,"' he said. Drunk won, 5-4.
The next day, in a phone interview, Mr. Levai offered the opinion that the Grateful Dead cover band was a factor in the outcome. "Some people thought it would be an advantage for the Stoned team," he said, "but my feeling was that it might have ended up being a distraction."

IBM Tries Assuring Customers Generative A.I. Is a Safe Bet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company will assume the legal risk of businesses that use its A.I. systems and will publish the technology's underlying data.
There is no shortage of excitement in corporate America for the new artificial intelligence that can produce everything from business reports to computer code with humanlike fluency.
Plenty of companies are experimenting with the technology, called generative A.I., but they are worried about how confidential data will be handled, the accuracy of A.I.-generated answers and potential legal liability.
IBM on Thursday announced its campaign to ease customers' qualms. The company said it would indemnify companies against copyright or other intellectual property claims for using its generative A.I. systems. IBM will also publish its data sets -- the underlying data that is used to build or "train" the A.I. system -- which is not standard practice among commercial providers of generative A.I. technology.
The announcement is an indication that, while attention has been focused on the new A.I. technology in chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, IBM is laying its plans to tackle the market.
IBM's customers are mostly other businesses, and persuading those companies to use new A.I. products means assuring them that they won't run into legal trouble. OpenAI, for example, has already been sued by a collection of authors who accuse it of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train ChatGPT.
Over the last year, start-ups like OpenAI and other industry giants like Google and Microsoft have been much more aggressive than IBM about publicly discussing their A.I. work. Even Meta, the parent company of Facebook, this week introduced A.I. chatbots meant to sound like celebrities such as the quarterback Tom Brady and the hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg.
IBM's relatively quiet stance showed how much the tech industry had changed in the 12 years since IBM's Watson A.I. system beat top competitors on "Jeopardy!" A.I. became a centerpiece of IBM's pitch to corporate customers, but the company has been overshadowed by younger competitors in the nearly yearlong A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.
Other technology suppliers are also trying to reassure customers by assuming legal risks. Microsoft pledged this month to defend customers in any copyright suits that arise from using its A.I.-powered Copilots, which it is adding to its office productivity software and programming tools. Adobe has made a similar commitment for copyright claims against customers using Adobe Firefly, its A.I. art-generation software.
The IBM A.I. systems -- or "models," as developers call them -- are tailored for use by businesses. And the training data has been curated with companies in mind and culled from the internet, academic journals, computer code repositories, and legal and finance documents, the company said.
IBM appears to be going further than other companies in taking on risk and opening up its model-training data. But it is in step with where the business market for generative A.I. is heading, said Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analysis firm.
The big A.I.-fueled consumer services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard are closed, and people outside the companies behind them cannot usually see what data those systems are built on. That will not satisfy most corporate customers, Mr. Moorhead said.
"Businesses need to know the data inputs and get a sense of why you got the answer you did," he said. "Putting their customer or confidential data into an A.I. model is seen as high risk for a business."
IBM is positioning itself as a partner for companies that want to create their own A.I. technology, by adding their business data to IBM's open models.
The early focus of most business technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, has largely been on embedding generative A.I. to improve their existing digital tools for office productivity, supply chain management, customer service and marketing.
IBM will deploy that A.I. in its products as well, but its emphasis is helping businesses become creators, as well as customers, of generative A.I. technology.
In business, the A.I. models are large, but far smaller than needed for the big consumer chatbots, said Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president for software. The narrower focus also helps improve accuracy. "And for our market, accuracy is way more important than size," he said.
The smaller models also require far less computing firepower than the giant consumer chatbots. That, Mr. Thomas said, should open the door to wider use of generative A.I. in operations that promise an immediate impact and payoff, including customer service, automated back-office tasks and digital assistants for writing code.
In those fields, "we see a defensible return on investment at the moment," Mr. Thomas said. "The economics work."

Justice Dept. Targets eBay Over Unlawful Sales
The Justice Department filed a civil complaint against eBay, claiming the online marketplace unlawfully sold and distributed hundreds of thousands of products like pesticides and motor vehicle emission-evading devices that violate environmental laws.
The complaint Wednesday claims eBay sold, offered for sale or caused the sale of more than 343,000 aftermarket devices that try to evade motor vehicle emissions controls.
It also alleges the company unlawfully distributed or sold at least 23,000 pesticides that were unregistered, misbranded or for restricted use.
In addition, the complaint claims eBay distributed more than 5,600 painting and coating removal products that include methylene chloride.
eBay called the government's actions "entirely unprecedented," and said that it planned to vigorously defend itself.

Hyundai and Kia Recall 3.4 Million Vehicles
Hyundai and Kia are recalling nearly 3.4 million vehicles in the U.S. and telling owners to park them outside and away from structures because of the risk of engine compartment fires.
The recalls cover multiple car and S.U.V. models from the 2010 through 2019 model years including Hyundai's Santa Fe SUV and Kia's Sorrento SUV.
Documents posted Wednesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say the anti-lock brake control module can leak fluid and cause an electrical short, which can touch off a fire while the vehicles are parked or being driven.
Dealers will replace the anti-lock brake fuse at no cost.
Hyundai reported 21 fires in the affected vehicles in the U.S., and another 22 "thermal incidents" including smoke, burning and melting of parts, the documents say. Kia reported 10 fires and melting incidents. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Orders for Durable Goods Exceeded Expectations
Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose in August as an increase in machinery and other products offset a drop in civilian aircraft, and business spending on equipment appeared to regain momentum after faltering early in the third quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed shipments of capital goods rebounding sharply last month, a sign of resilience in both business investment and the overall economy despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening. The surge in shipments compensated for downward revisions to July's data.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, gained 0.2 percent last month. Data for July was revised lower to show orders for these goods decreasing 5.6 percent instead of 5.2 percent, as previously reported. REUTERS

Switching Search Is Not as Simple As Google Asserts: [Correction]

Full text: Google says a change takes just a few steps, but a panel of designers found otherwise. The issue is at the heart of a federal antitrust trial.
Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.
This cereal happens to be the most popular, so it's convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don't like it, it's simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.
That's essentially the crux of Google's defense against the Justice Department in a consequential antitrust trial -- the federal government's first such case in the modern internet era -- that is now unfolding in court.
The government has accused Google of illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, the Justice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, like smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, like Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.
But Google has argued that it's easy for people to change their search engine -- just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.
The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?
I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:
On an iPhone, it takes four taps.
On a Mac's Safari browser, it takes two clicks.
On Android phones, it takes two taps.
So I followed Google's instructions and also shared the company's guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It's hard to switch -- and most people would probably give up before completing the change.
"God help me, I'm dead," Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: "Most people will just stick with it."
I had similar takeaways. Here's what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.
On an iPhone
Google said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.
In reality, it's more complicated.
Once the Settings app is open, Safari doesn't immediately appear on the screen. It's buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.
But even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Mr. Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go -- to hop on a bus, for instance.
"You cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory," he said.
On a Mac
With just two clicks, Google said, Mac users can switch the default search engine on the Safari browser to a different service -- by first clicking on the magnifying glass icon and then selecting a different search engine, like Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
That's much simpler than on an iPhone. But not everyone knows that the magnifying glass icon is a button -- it allows people to enter a query in the search bar.
More problematic is that switching search engines can be confusing, because the steps are inconsistent between Safari on an iPhone and Safari on a Mac, said Tony Hu, a director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who oversees an engineering leadership program.
"Overall, the average person would probably struggle with this," he said.
Mr. Selker said a better design would have been to make changing the search engine more "in your face," like a prompt asking users to choose a search engine when opening the browser.
"It has to make you aware it's there until you've dismissed it," he said.
On Android
On an Android phone, Google said, it takes one long press on the search bar to prompt the Remove button to appear. Users can then tap on it to remove the Google search bar widget from the home screen.
This example is especially flawed. First, Google's steps to remove the search bar widget work on some Samsung phones, but they do not work across all Android devices. On Google's Pixel phones, for example, when a user long presses on the search bar, no Remove option appears.
Most important, removing the search widget deletes a shortcut to the Google search bar on the home screen, but it does not change the search engine in an Android web browser. Changing to a different search engine requires a different set of steps. Similar to the path on iPhones, it's a four-step process that involves opening the browser and changing its settings.
The default option
The overarching lesson from the government's antitrust trial against Google is that when companies make arrangements to become a default option, they are aware you will probably stick with the status quo because switching to an alternative requires awareness and effort, said Mr. Brignull, the author of "Deceptive Patterns: Exposing the Tricks Tech Companies Use to Control You."
Google said in a statement that it was easy for people to change their default search engine on Android devices and Apple's Safari. The company added that on Windows computers, which require a long process to switch from Bing as the default search engine in Microsoft's Edge browser, the overwhelming majority of people chose Google as their search engine.
With all of that in mind, and the instructions now in front of you, you can try other search engines. If it turns out that you prefer Google anyway, at least it will be your decision -- not Google's.

Google Says Switching Away From Its Search Engine Is Easy. It’s Not.

Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.
This cereal happens to be the most popular, so it’s convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don’t like it, it’s simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.
That’s essentially the crux of Google’s defense against the Justice Department in a consequential antitrust trial — the federal government’s first such case in the modern internet era — that is now unfolding in court.
The government has accused Google of illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, the Justice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, including smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, such as Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.
But Google has argued that it’s easy for people to change their search engine — just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.
The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?
I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:
— On an iPhone, it takes four taps.
— On a Mac’s Safari browser, it takes two clicks.
— On Android phones, it takes two taps.
So I followed Google’s instructions and also shared the company’s guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It’s hard to switch — and most people would probably give up before completing the change.
“God help me, I’m dead,” Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: “Most people will just stick with it.”
I had similar takeaways. Here’s what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.
On an iPhone
Google said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.
In reality, it’s more complicated.
Once the Settings app is open, Safari doesn’t immediately appear on the screen. It’s buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.
But even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go — to hop on a bus, for instance.
“You cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory,” he said.
On a Mac
With just two clicks, Google said, Mac users can switch the default search engine on the Safari browser to a different service — by first clicking on the magnifying glass icon and then selecting a different search engine, like Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
That’s much simpler than on an iPhone. But not everyone knows that the magnifying glass icon is a button — it allows people to enter a query in the search bar.

The A.I. Overlords Are Already Ruining the Internet: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Greg Marston, a British voice actor, recently came across "Connor" online -- an A.I.-generated clone of his voice, trained on a recording Mr. Marston had made in 2003. It was his voice uttering things he had never said.
Back then, he had recorded a session for IBM and later signed a release form allowing the recording to be used in many ways. Of course, at that time, Mr. Marston couldn't envision that IBM would use anything more than the exact utterances he had recorded. Thanks to artificial intelligence, however, IBM was able to sell Mr. Marston's decades-old sample to websites that are using it to build a synthetic voice that could say anything. Mr. Marston recently discovered his voice emanating from the Wimbledon website during the tennis tournament. (IBM said it is aware of Mr. Marston's concern and is discussing it with him directly.)
His plight illustrates why many of our economy's best-known creators are up in arms. We are in a time of eroding trust, as people realize that their contributions to a public space may be taken, monetized and potentially used to compete with them. When that erosion is complete, I worry that our digital public spaces might become even more polluted with untrustworthy content.
Already, artists are deleting their work from X, formerly known as Twitter, after the company said it would be using data from its platform to train its A.I. Hollywood writers and actors are on strike partly because they want to ensure their work is not fed into A.I. systems that companies could try to replace them with. News outlets including The New York Times and CNN have added files to their website to help prevent A.I. chatbots from scraping their content.
Authors are suing A.I. outfits, alleging that their books are included in the sites' training data. OpenAI has argued, in a separate proceeding, that the use of copyrighted data for training A.I. systems is legal under the "fair use" provision of copyright law.
While creators of quality content are contesting how their work is being used, dubious A.I.-generated content is stampeding into the public sphere. NewsGuard has identified 475 A.I.-generated news and information websites in 14 languages. A.I.-generated music is flooding streaming websites and generating A.I. royalties for scammers. A.I.-generated books -- including a mushroom foraging guide that could lead to mistakes in identifying highly poisonous fungi -- are so prevalent on Amazon that the company is asking authors who self-publish on its Kindle platform to also declare if they are using A.I.
This is a classic case of tragedy of the commons, where a common resource is harmed by the profit interests of individuals. The traditional example of this is a public field that cattle can graze upon. Without any limits, individual cattle owners have an incentive to overgraze the land, destroying its value to everybody.
We have commons on the internet, too. Despite all of its toxic corners, it is still full of vibrant portions that serve the public good -- places like Wikipedia and Reddit forums, where volunteers often share knowledge in good faith and work hard to keep bad actors at bay.
But these commons are now being overgrazed by rapacious tech companies that seek to feed all of the human wisdom, expertise, humor, anecdotes and advice they find in these places into their for-profit A.I. systems.
Consider, for instance, that the volunteers who build and maintain Wikipedia trusted that their work would be used according to the terms of their site, which requires attribution. Now some Wikipedians are apparently debating whether they have any legal recourse against chatbots that use their content without citing the source.
Regulators are trying to figure it out, too. The European Union is considering the first set of global restrictions on A.I., which would require some transparency from generative A.I. systems, including providing summaries of copyrighted data that was used to train its systems.
That would be a good step forward, since many A.I. systems do not fully disclose the data they were trained on. It has primarily been journalists who have dug up the murky data that lies beneath the glossy surface of the chatbots. A recent investigation detailed in The Atlantic revealed that more than 170,000 pirated books are included in the training data for Meta's A.I. chatbot, Llama. A Washington Post investigation revealed that OpenAI's ChatGPT relies on data scraped without consent from hundreds of thousands of websites.
But transparency is hardly enough to rebalance the power between those whose data is being exploited and the companies poised to cash in on the exploitation.
Tim Friedlander, founder and president of the National Association of Voice Actors, has called for A.I. companies to adopt ethical standards. He says that actors need three Cs: consent, control and compensation.
In fact, all of us need the three Cs. Whether we are professional actors or we just post pictures on social media, everyone should have the right to meaningful consent on whether we want our online lives fed into the giant A.I. machines.
And consent should not mean having to locate a bunch of hard-to-find opt-out buttons to click -- which is where the industry is heading.
Compensation is harder to figure out, especially since most of the A.I. bots are primarily free services at the moment. But make no mistake, the A.I. industry is planning to and will make money from these systems, and when it does, there will be a reckoning with those whose works fueled the profits.
For people like Mr. Marston, their livelihoods are at stake. He estimates that his A.I. clone has already lost him jobs and will cut into his future earnings significantly. He is working with a lawyer to seek compensation. "I never agreed or consented to having my voice cloned, to see/hear it released to the public, thus competing against myself," he told me.
But even those of us who don't have a job directly threatened by A.I. think of writing that novel or composing a song or recording a TikTok or making a joke on social media. If we don't have any protections from the A.I. data overgrazers, I worry that it will feel pointless to even try to create in public. And that would be a real tragedy.

The Google Antitrust Trial Is Really About the Future of A.I.: [Op-Ed]

Author: Wu, Tim

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Google antitrust trial, which began last week, is ostensibly focused on the past -- on a series of deals that Google made with other companies over the past two decades. The prosecution in the case, U.S. et al. v. Google, contends that Google illegally spent billions of dollars paying off Samsung and Apple to prevent anyone else from gaining a foothold in the market for online search.
But the true focus of the trial, like that of the Federal Trade Commission's coming trial of Facebook's parent company, Meta, on monopolization charges, is on the future. For the verdict will effectively establish the rules governing tech competition for the next decade, including the battle over commercialized artificial intelligence, as well as newer technologies we cannot yet envision.
The history of antitrust prosecutions shows this again and again: Loosening the grip of a controlling monopolist may not always solve the problem at hand (here, an online search monopoly). But it can open up closed markets, shake up the industry and spark innovation in unexpected areas. If Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the trial without a jury, decides this case correctly, he'll be helping the entire tech world and the American economy more broadly.
Consider the antitrust lawsuit that led to the breakup of AT&T's telephone monopoly in 1984. At the time, prosecutors were focused on lowering the pricing of long-distance telephone calls and giving consumers greater choice. But more important and less anticipated, the breakup helped to jump-start the internet revolution of the 1990s, in part by making it easier for companies to conduct business over phone lines and for customers to connect modems to them.
Or consider IBM's monopoly on mainframe computing, which was challenged by private and public antitrust suits in the 1960s and '70s. At the time, a chief concern was the use of "vaporware" tactics in the mainframe market, which affected a now-long-dead company called the Control Data Corporation. But what matters today is that IBM, out of fear that it would be broken up, unbundled its software from its hardware, which created a market for software sold as a separate product -- spawning, over time, what is now a multi-trillion-dollar industry. The suit also weakened IBM at the very time that personal computers were emerging, benefiting tiny upstarts like Apple and Microsoft.
As this history suggests, it's unlikely that we know exactly what new forms of computing a verdict against Google would make room for. The path of technological evolution is not predictable. But we do know that monopolies tend to stifle innovation and keep too much for themselves, and that forcing a monopolist to back off yields fruit.
The story of Google's own creation is another good example. Google began as a small start-up with a great product, but it was also a beneficiary of federal government intervention. Google began its operations reliant on Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, which had a roughly 95 percent market share in the early 2000s. And Microsoft was running its own search engine on Internet Explorer, then called MSN Search (later renamed Bing). Fortunately for Google, Microsoft had just been put through the wringer by the Justice Department, whose antitrust lawsuit nearly led to a breakup of the company. In the end, Google beat Bing in part because it had a better product -- but also because it wasn't facing the nasty Microsoft of the 1990s, but rather a weakened and chastened Microsoft operating under federal oversight.
Today Google is both interested in and threatened by the large language model technology of companies like OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT. Google has spent many billions of dollars on A.I. research, including developing its own chatbot, Bard, and recently rushed to incorporate dozens of A.I. features into its products. But as a giant, entrenched company, Google has the disadvantage of needing to protect its existing revenue streams and keep its investors, customers and advertisers happy. It has a strong incentive to make sure that A.I. doesn't turn into something that disrupts or destroys its current business.
At the trial in Washington last week, the prosecution (which includes the federal as well as state governments) made clear that Google leveraged its money and power over the past decade to stifle competition, paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars to make Google the default search setting for their phones. Apple also agreed to stay out of Google's business: handling search queries.
That's why Judge Mehta should force Google to sell off its Chrome browser (which has a roughly 63 percent market share) and ban the company's "pay for default" deals with the operating systems for Apple and Android phones. Otherwise, Google will surely be tempted to use its money and control over Chrome to ensure that any rivals in the field of A.I. aren't as successful with their products as Google is with its own.
The cases against Google and Meta are, in effect, a distinctively American form of industrial policy. Many countries choose to subsidize their tech monopolists, but the United States has shown that undermining a monopolist's dominance can be a better alternative. Doing so also serves to check what is perhaps the least accountable form of power in the United States, a power that at times feels like a threat to the idea of rule by the people. These are some of the reasons that the Biden administration, for which I worked for two years on tech competition policy, has made a robust effort to rein in the power of big tech.
Ultimately, antitrust law's most important function is to rebalance economic power, taming the excesses that are the inevitable consequences of a capitalist economy. The tech industries are prone to monopoly, yet as history suggests, they can be extraordinarily generative when given the right nudge. The point of the Google prosecution is not to hurt Google but to force it to make way for the next generation of technologists and their dreams.

Key to Walkout: Industry's Shift To Electric Cars: [National Desk]

Full text: Carmakers are anxious to keep costs down as they ramp up electric vehicle manufacturing, while striking workers want to preserve jobs as the industry shifts to batteries.
A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated on Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry's future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford's moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 U.A.W. workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40 percent pay increase over four years but the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the U.A.W. would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
"The transition to E.V.s is dominating every bit of this discussion," said John Casesa, senior managing director at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
"It's unspoken," Mr. Casesa added. "But really, it's all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry."
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $ 4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers' total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla's employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, said in an interview on Friday. "We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future," he said, "not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers."
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don't need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the U.A.W. has more clout. One of the union's demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers' national labor contracts -- a demand that the automakers have said they can't meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
"We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution and the way we're going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution -- a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the U.A.W. and other unions.
"The U.A.W. is really taking a stand for communities across the country to make sure this transition benefits everybody," Ms. Janis added.
Automakers have been racking up record profits during the last decade, but they cannot afford to lose time from work stoppages in their race to compete with Tesla and foreign automakers.
The three companies are already struggling to get their electric vehicle business going. A new G.M. battery factory in Ohio has been slow to produce batteries, delaying electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and other vehicles. Ford this year had to suspend production of its electric F-150 Lightning in February after a battery caught fire in one of the pickups that was parked near the factory for a quality check. And Stellantis won't even begin selling any fully electric vehicles in the United States until next year.
Those problems and Tesla's growing sales could put the union in a strong position to extract a good deal.
On Thursday, in a sign that automakers are willing to go much further than they had previously, G.M. offered a 20 percent pay raise over four years. That is half of what the union is seeking but far more than workers received in recent contracts. President Biden on Friday strongly supported the union in remarks at the White House. The administration has been pouring billions into programs to promote electric vehicles and does not want a strike to delay a centerpiece of its climate policy.
Despite all the money that automakers have made in recent years, their executives express a profound unease about the growth of electric vehicles, which account for 7 percent of the U.S. new car market so far this year and are on track to surpass sales of one million this year. Managers are acutely aware that traditional companies like theirs have a poor track record of retaining dominance after a big change in technology. Witness the way that Apple sidelined Nokia and Motorola as cellphones became smartphones.
Auto company executives and most industry analysts underestimated how quickly electric vehicles would catch on and cannot confidently forecast how sales, which have been bumpy lately, will grow in the future. "I don't think anyone can perfectly predict what the adoption will be," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Speaking to "CBS Mornings" on Friday, Ms. Barra said an excessive pay raise would undermine G.M.'s ability to continue producing vehicles with internal combustion engines while also developing electric vehicles. "This is a critical juncture where investing is very important," she said.
Still, unions and their supporters are unlikely to express much sympathy for auto executives. Ms. Barra, Mr. Farley of Ford and the chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, have gotten tens of millions of dollars in compensation packages in recent years. The companies' shareholders have been rewarded with dividends and share buybacks.
Unions "are not going to have a lot of patience for sob stories," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online marketplace.
Adjusted for inflation, wages for autoworkers in the United States have fallen 19 percent since 2008, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
At the same time, union officials are aware of the changes in the industry and have said they do not want to handicap G.M., Ford and Stellantis as the companies try to recover ground they have lost to Tesla, which has aggressively resisted attempts to unionize its factories. The Detroit carmakers also face challengers like Rivian, a start-up that makes electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Illinois, as well as foreign-owned rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, whose U.S. factories, mostly in the South, are not unionized.
"That's the biggest challenge here," Mr. Brauer added, "trying to commit to a long-term contract in an industry that is very uncertain and unpredictable over the next five years."
Union supporters say it would be wrong to blame workers if the traditional carmakers cannot compete with Tesla and other rivals.
"If you look at the breakdown at what it costs to build an E.V., labor is a very small part of the equation. Batteries are the most," Ms. Janis of Jobs to Move America said. "This idea that the U.A.W. is going to price Ford, G.M. and Stellantis out of the market is not true."
But other analysts said that a long work stoppage could help Tesla and foreign automakers gain ground on G.M., Ford and Stellantis.
"If something happens to disrupt their business, does that give a leg up to the emerging electric vehicle makers?" said Steve Patton, who overseas the consulting firm EY's work with auto companies. "Who stands to benefit if there is a protracted strike?"

Battle Over Electric Vehicles Is Central to Auto Strike

A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry’s future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford’s moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40% pay increase over four years; the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the UAW would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
“The transition to EVs is dominating every bit of this discussion,” said John Casesa, senior managing director at investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
“It's unspoken,” Casesa added. “But really, it’s all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry.”
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, GM and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers’ total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla’s employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company’s CEO, said in an interview Friday. “We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future,” he said, “not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers.”

Macy's Names C.E.O.
For Bloomingdale's
Macy's named Olivier Bron, right, the next chief executive of Bloomingdale's, the company's luxury chain, on Tuesday, the latest move in a leadership shuffle this year.
Mr. Bron was previously chief executive of Central Group's Central and Robinson Department Stores in Thailand. He will start in November, succeeding Tony Spring. Macy's announced this year that Mr. Spring would be elevated to chief executive of Macy's in February after the planned retirement of Jeff Gennette, who has led the company since 2017.
Macy's has ambitions to become more competitive in e-commerce as younger shoppers pull away from department stores. Mr. Gennette previously said Bloomingdale's had worked as a "scrappy incubator" for ideas that made their way to Macy's.
Macy's, the largest department store chain in the United States, has been feeling pressure as consumers increasingly tighten their purse strings amid stubborn inflation. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Macy's said sales had dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. Bloomingdale's, which targets higher-earning shoppers, was less affected but still reported a 2.6 percent decline in sales.
Macy's also reported a "faster than expected" rise in credit card delinquencies.
"Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pull back on spend in our discretionary categories," Mr. Gennette told analysts in an Aug. 22 earnings call. "They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income with an ongoing shift to services and experiences." J. EDWARD MORENO
TECHNOLOGY
Eight More Companies
Pledge to Make A.I. Safe
The White House said on Tuesday that eight more companies involved in artificial intelligence had pledged to voluntarily follow standards for safety, security and trust with the fast-evolving technology.
The companies include Adobe, IBM, Palantir, Nvidia and Salesforce. They joined Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection AI, Microsoft and OpenAI, which initiated an industry-led effort on safeguards in an announcement with the White House in July. The companies have committed to testing and other security measures, which are not regulations and are not enforced by the government.
Grappling with A.I. has become paramount since OpenAI released the powerful ChatGPT chatbot last year. The technology has since been under scrutiny for affecting people's jobs, spreading misinformation and potentially developing its own intelligence.
On Wednesday, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Sundar Pichai of Google will be among a dozen tech executives meeting with lawmakers in a closed-door A.I. summit hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York.
"The president has been clear: Harness the benefits of A.I., manage the risks and move fast -- very fast," the White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, said in a statement. "And we are doing just that by partnering with the private sector and pulling every lever we have to get this done."
The companies agreed to include testing future products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot A.I.-generated material. They also agreed to share information about security risks across the industry and report any potential biases in their systems. CECILIA KANG

Biden Says He Will Nominate a Former F.A.A. Deputy to Lead the Agency: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
President Biden announced on Thursday that he planned to nominate Michael G. Whitaker, who served as the No. 2 official at the Federal Aviation Administration during the Obama administration, to become the agency's next permanent leader.
Mr. Whitaker currently serves as the chief operating officer for Supernal, a Hyundai Motor company that is developing air taxis. He was the F.A.A.'s deputy administrator from 2013 to 2016 and has also been an executive at United Airlines.
Why It Matters: The F.A.A. has lacked a permanent leader for 17 months.
The F.A.A. has been without permanent leadership since Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive and an appointee of President Donald J. Trump, stepped down last year.
Mr. Biden's first nominee for the post, Phillip A. Washington, the chief executive of Denver International Airport, withdrew from consideration in March after running into resistance in the Senate.
The failure of Mr. Washington's nomination has prolonged the leadership void atop the agency. The F.A.A. official who served as acting administrator after Mr. Dickson's departure, Billy Nolen, left the agency in June.
Polly Trottenberg, the deputy transportation secretary, has been serving as the F.A.A.'s acting administrator, but she will have to turn over the reins to another temporary leader in late October because of a federal law that limits how long she can run the agency on an acting basis.
Background: It's been a bumpy stretch for the airline industry.
Mr. Whitaker would take the helm of the F.A.A. at an eventful time.
Travelers have flocked to the skies as the coronavirus pandemic has receded, and a series of near collisions around the country has raised concerns about safety. A New York Times investigation published last month found that near misses involving commercial airliners have been happening far more frequently than previously known.
Passengers have also endured a string of delays and cancellations, including when an F.A.A. system outage in January forced a halt to flights nationwide.
In Washington, Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize the F.A.A., giving lawmakers an opportunity to leave their imprint on the nation's aviation policies. The House passed a bill in July that would reauthorize the agency for the next five years, but the Senate has yet to act. Lawmakers may end up passing an extension to buy themselves more time.
What's Next: The Senate will consider the nomination.
Mr. Whitaker's nomination will go before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the panel where Mr. Washington's nomination ran aground.
Mr. Washington had spent most of his career in the Army and at transit agencies, and Republicans senators painted him as unqualified to lead the F.A.A. But Mr. Whitaker has a long résumé in the aviation industry, so he is likely to fare better on that front. A lawyer by training, he became certified as a private pilot during his stint as the F.A.A.'s deputy administrator.
"America needs a confirmed F.A.A. administrator, and Mike Whitaker is the right leader for the job," Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. "He knows aviation, he knows safety, he knows the F.A.A. and he knows how to manage and modernize large organizations."
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, was noncommittal about the president's selection.
"After several near misses, chronic air traffic controller staffing shortages and ongoing problems with implementing new technology at the F.A.A.," Mr. Cruz said in a statement, "we must carefully evaluate Mike Whitaker's qualifications, experience and temperament to determine whether he is the right person to lead the agency at this critical juncture."

Full text: The effort by Senators Richard Blumenthal and Josh Hawley is the latest move by lawmakers to catch up with the rapidly evolving technology.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, plan to announce a sweeping framework to regulate artificial intelligence, in the latest effort by Congress to catch up with the technology.
The leaders of the Senate judiciary's subcommittee for privacy, technology and law said in interviews on Thursday that their framework will include requirements for the licensing and auditing of A.I., the creation of an independent federal office to oversee the technology, liability for companies for privacy and civil rights violations, and requirements for data transparency and safety standards.
The lawmakers plan to highlight their proposals in an A.I. hearing on Tuesday, which will feature Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, and William Dally, the chief scientist for the A.I. chip maker Nvidia. Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Hawley plan to introduce bills from the framework.
On Wednesday, top tech executives including Elon Musk, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and OpenAI's Sam Altman will meet with the Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, and other lawmakers in a separate closed-door meeting on A.I. regulations.
Since the release of the ChatGPT chatbot in November, lawmakers in Washington have raced to educate themselves on A.I.'s risks and opportunities to create rules for the industry. Mr. Blumenthal said lawmakers did not want to repeat the mistakes they made in failing to agree on privacy, safety and security laws for social media companies.
"We are really moving very forcefully and promptly toward legislation," said Mr. Blumenthal, chair of the subcommittee. "Our goal is not only to educate and inform the public but to reach very specific and definite results."
Many A.I. leaders have called for regulations and warned about the risks of their technologies to spread disinformation, kill jobs and disrupt elections. Mr. Altman has demonstrated ChatGPT to more than 100 members of Congress and met with many lawmakers privately to discuss regulations. Dario Amodei, the chief executive of the A.I. start-up Anthropic, testified in Congress in July about A.I.'s potential to create bioweapons.
The lawmakers drew the proposals from two hearings held this year with A.I. experts, including Mr. Altman. In one of the hearings, Mr. Altman said he supported the idea of an independent agency to oversee A.I., licensing requirements and safety standards.
But the framework is set to receive pushback from the tech industry. IBM and Google have argued against the creation of a new oversight office for the technology.
Wednesday's meeting on A.I. regulations led by Mr. Schumer will count Mr. Musk, Mr. Nadella, Mr. Altman, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta among the attendees, as well as leaders of labor unions and civil society groups. It is Mr. Schumer's first "A.I. Insight Forum," part of a series of listening sessions for lawmakers to learn about the technology.
That effort may take many months. Mr. Hawley said he worried that tech executives have had too much weight in private conversations led by Mr. Schumer. "I'm just disappointed that this isn't happening in public, and it's not a real hearing," he said about Mr. Schumer's meeting.
The White House has also met with the chiefs of Microsoft, Google, OpenAI and other firms and has announced that the companies agreed to voluntary safety standards.

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

A.I. Revolution Is Coming. Just When Is Hard to Say.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: From steam power to the internet, there has always been a lag between technology invention and adoption across industries and the economy.
Lori Beer, the global chief information officer of JPMorgan Chase, talks about the latest artificial intelligence with the enthusiasm of a convert. She refers to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT, with its ability to produce everything from poetry to computer programs, as "transformative" and a "paradigm shift."
But it's not coming soon to the nation's largest bank. JPMorgan has blocked access to ChatGPT from its computers and told its 300,000 workers not to put any bank information into the chatbot or other generative A.I. tools.
For now, Ms. Beer said, there are too many risks of leaking confidential data, questions about how the data is used and about the accuracy of the A.I.-generated answers. The bank has created a walled-off, private network to allow a few hundred data scientists and engineers to experiment with the technology. They are exploring uses like automating and improving tech support and software development.
Across corporate America, the perspective is much the same. Generative A.I., the software engine behind ChatGPT, is seen as an exciting new wave of technology. But companies in every industry are mainly trying out the technology and thinking through the economics. Widespread use of it at many companies could be years away.
Generative A.I., according to forecasts, could sharply boost productivity and add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Yet the lesson of history, from steam power to the internet, is that there is a lengthy lag between the arrival of major new technology and its broad adoption -- which is what transforms industries and helps fuel the economy.
Take the internet. In the 1990s, there were confident predictions that the internet and the web would disrupt the retailing, advertising and media industries. Those predictions proved to be true, but that was more than a decade later, well after the dot-com bubble had burst.
Over that time, the technology improved and costs dropped, so bottlenecks fell away. Broadband internet connections eventually became commonplace. Easy-to-use payment systems were developed. Audio and video streaming technology became far better.
Fueling the development were a flood of money and a surge of entrepreneurial trial and error.
"We're going to see a similar gold rush this time," said Vijay Sankaran, chief technology officer of Johnson Controls, a large supplier of building equipment, software and services. "We'll see a lot of learning."
The investment frenzy is well underway. In the first half of 2023, funding for generative A.I. start-ups reached $ 15.3 billion, nearly three times the total for all of last year, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-up investments.
Corporate technology managers are sampling generative A.I. software from a host of suppliers and watching to see how the industry shakes out.
In November, when ChatGPT was made available to the public, it was a "Netscape moment" for generative A.I., said Rob Thomas, IBM's chief commercial officer, referring to Netscape's introduction of the browser in 1994. "That brought the internet alive," Mr. Thomas said. But it was just a beginning, opening a door to new business opportunities that took years to exploit.
In a recent report, the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, included a timeline for the widespread adoption of generative A.I. applications. It assumed steady improvement in currently known technology, but not future breakthroughs. Its forecast for mainstream adoption was neither short nor precise, a range of eight to 27 years.
The broad range is explained by plugging in different assumptions about economic cycles, government regulation, corporate cultures and management decisions.
"We're not modeling the laws of physics here; we're modeling economics and societies, and people and companies," said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute. "What happens is largely the result of human choices."
Technology diffuses across the economy through people, who bring their skills to new industries. A few months ago, Davis Liang left an A.I. group at Meta to join Abridge, a health care start-up that records and summarizes patient visits for physicians. Its generative A.I. software can save doctors from hours of typing up patient notes and billing reports.
Mr. Liang, a 29-year-old computer scientist, has been an author on scientific papers and helped build so-called large language models that animate generative A.I.
His skills are in demand these days. Mr. Liang declined to say, but people with his experience and background at generative A.I. start-ups are typically paid a base salary of more than $ 200,000, and stock grants can potentially take the total compensation far higher.
The main appeal of Abridge, Mr. Liang said, was applying the "superpowerful tool" of A.I. in health care and "improving the working lives of physicians." He was recruited by Zachary Lipton, a former research scientist in Amazon's A.I. group, who is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Lipton joined Abridge early this year as chief scientific officer.
"We're not working on ads or something like that," Mr. Lipton said. "There is a level of fulfillment when you're getting thank-you letters from physicians every day."
Significant new technologies are flywheels for follow-on innovation, spawning start-ups that build applications to make the underlying technology useful and accessible. In its early years, the personal computer was seen as a hobbyist's plaything. But the creation of the spreadsheet program -- the "killer app" of its day -- made the PC an essential tool in business.
Sarah Nagy led a data science team at Citadel, a giant investment firm, in 2020 when she first tinkered with GPT-3. It was more than two years before OpenAI released ChatGPT. But the power of the fundamental technology was apparent in 2020.
Ms. Nagy was particularly impressed by the software's ability to generate computer code from text commands. That, she figured, could help democratize data analysis inside companies, making it broadly accessible to businesspeople instead of an elite group.
In 2021, Ms. Nagy founded Seek AI to pursue that goal. The New York start-up now has about two dozen customers in the technology, retail and finance industries, mostly working on pilot projects.
Using Seek AI's software, a retail manager, for example, could type in questions about product sales, ad campaigns and online versus in-store performance to guide marketing strategy and spending. The software then transforms the words into a computer-coded query, searches the company's storehouse of data, and returns answers in text or retrieves the relevant data.
Businesspeople, Ms. Nagy said, can get answers almost instantly or within a day instead of a couple of weeks, if they have to make a request for something that requires the attention of a member of a data science team.
"At the end of the day, we're trying to reduce the time it takes to get an answer or useful data," Ms. Nagy said.
Saving time and streamlining work inside companies are the prime early targets for generative A.I. in most businesses. New products and services will come later.
This year, JPMorgan trademarked IndexGPT as a possible name for a generative A.I.-driven investment advisory product.
"That's something we will look at and continue to assess over time," said Ms. Beer, the bank's tech leader. "But it's not close to launching yet."

Gil Brandt, 91, Scout for the Dallas Cowboys: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As talent evaluator for nearly 30 years, he built Dallas into an N.F.L. powerhouse through the use of computer technology and other innovations.
Gil Brandt, who in nearly 30 years as a scout and talent evaluator helped build the Dallas Cowboys into a National Football League powerhouse, died on Thursday in Dallas. He was 91.
His death, in hospice care, was announced by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, to which he was inducted in 2019.
Mr. Brandt joined the Cowboys in 1960, before their first season, and worked beside Tom Landry, the taciturn head coach, and Tex Schramm, the innovative president and general manager, to make them a perennial winner and a two-time Super Bowl champion. In time, the Cowboys became known as "America's Team."
As the team's vice president of player personnel, Mr. Brandt was known for expanding his scouting beyond major-conference schools. He drafted future stars like the wide receiver Bob Hayes, the defensive tackle Jethro Pugh, the offensive lineman Rayfield Wright and the linebacker Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson, who all played at historically Black colleges and universities.
Mr. Hayes, Mr. Wright, and the quarterbacks Roger Staubach and Troy Aikman are among the nine players whose drafting Mr. Brandt oversaw and who were later elected to the Hall of Fame.
But it was not only where Mr. Brandt and the Cowboys' scouts discovered talent that separated Dallas from other teams. It was also the use of psychological tests to assess potential draft picks' characters. In addition, his contribution to modern talent appraisal rested on the team's forward-thinking use of technology.
At Mr. Schramm's suggestion, Mr. Brandt began using a massive IBM computer in 1962 to evaluate prospects. He assigned numerical values to personality traits, including character and competitiveness, and to many physical qualities like quickness and strength. He then stored them on punch cards and loaded them into the computer.
The process resulted in a database that enabled the Cowboys to sift through information quickly and comprehensively, weigh the talents of prospects and make recommendations to Mr. Landry and Mr. Schramm. This gave the team a competitive edge.
The Cowboys' reputation for using a computer became known quickly.
During the 1964 college draft, held in the ballroom of a Chicago hotel, the Cowboys were stalling on making their second pick. Vince Lombardi, the Green Bay Packers' coach, scolded Mr. Brandt and his fellow Dallas executives.
In interviews, Mr. Brandt recalled Mr. Lombardi asking him: "What happened? Did your computer break down?"
It had not. The Cowboys had sent a doctor to evaluate Mel Renfro, a cornerback from the University of Oregon. Once satisfied that he was healthy, they selected Mr. Renfro, who would become a five-time All-Pro and be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1996.
"It starts with the computer," Mr. Brandt said before his Hall of Fame induction, adding, "and that was really the thing that set us apart from everybody."
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal before his induction, he said: "They talk about analytics now. We did the same thing 50 years ago. Except we called it probabilities."
Gilbert Harvey Brandt was born on March 4, 1932, in Milwaukee. His father, also named Gilbert, was district manager for National Food Stores. His mother, Loretta, was a homemaker.
Gil played defensive back and running back in high school. He attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison but left after two years and moved back with his parents.
He took a job providing cameras to hospital nurses to use to photograph babies. He would then develop and distribute the pictures. It was not a path to a football career; he began that career thanks to a family friend, Elroy Hirsch, who was known as Crazy Legs when he was a Los Angeles Rams receiver and who owned a local business. He recommended that Mr. Schramm, then the Rams' general manager, hire Mr. Brandt as a part-time scout in the Midwest.
"I had a lot of time, and they were looking for somebody for $ 50 a weekend, or something like that," Mr. Brandt told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2009. "In the spring I'd go see Marquette, Wisconsin, Northwestern. In those days, I don't know if anybody knew a lot about it. If on a scale of what they do today is a 100, we were probably minus 10."
Mr. Schramm had already left the Rams to become assistant director of sports at CBS, but in 1959 he joined the expansion Cowboys and asked Mr. Brandt to come along. Mr. Landry, then defensive coach of the New York Giants, soon joined them.
"The great thing that happened to me," Mr. Brandt told The Journal Sentinel, "is we went to a place with an owner that had money" -- the oilman Clint Murchison Jr. -- "a G.M., Tex, who believed in scouting, and Tom was one of the greatest people of all time. We had more gimmicks than anybody in the world. It was easy. It was so less competitive then."
By the late 1980s, however, the Cowboys' success was waning. In 1989, after Jerry Jones bought the team, he fired Mr. Landry and Mr. Brandt. Mr. Schramm resigned.
Mr. Brandt soon reinvented himself -- first in the mid-1990s as a senior analyst on the N.F.L.'s website, and a decade later as a host on Sirius (later SiriusXM) satellite radio. He continued to make player evaluations on NFL.com in advance of each year's draft.
But in 2022, Mr. Brandt had to apologize for remarks he had made on SiriusXM after the death of Dwayne Haskins, a 24-year-old reserve Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, who was hit by a dump truck in Florida. Mr. Brandt implied that Mr. Haskins would have been alive had he not left Ohio State early.
"I reacted carelessly and insensitively on a radio interview," Mr. Brandt wrote on Twitter.
In addition to his wife, Sara (Paullus) Brandt, he is survived by two sons, Hunter and Brig.
The bad feelings between Mr. Brandt and Mr. Jones did not last long. They eventually became friends, and Mr. Jones added Mr. Brandt to the Cowboys' Ring of Honor in 2018. The next year, Mr. Brandt asked Mr. Jones to be his presenter at his Hall of Fame induction.
"As you know, Jerry and I have come a long way since our first three months of working together," he said in his speech. And he thanked Mr. Jones "for making me a free agent 30 years ago."

A Crime Wave Carmakers Enabled: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a recent analysis of data from 37 American cities, the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, suggested a hopeful trend -- the pandemic-era spike in crime may have peaked. The homicide rate has dropped significantly over the last year, based on data from 30 American cities. In many places, just about all types of violent crimes are down, in some areas substantially -- in Atlanta, for instance, there have been 21 percent fewer aggravated assaults, 28 percent fewer homicides and 56 percent fewer rapes than at this point in 2022, according to police department data.
But there's a glaring exception: auto thefts. According to the Council on Criminal Justice, "The number of vehicle thefts during the first half of 2023 was 33.5 percent higher, on average, than during the same period in 2022 -- representing 23,974 more vehicle thefts in the cities that reported data." In Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Chicago, New Orleans, Buffalo and Durham, N.C., motor vehicle thefts this year have more than doubled relative to last year, according to stats collected by Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst. This week, The Baltimore Sun reported that "auto thefts are on pace to more than double the total from last year, as reports through the first eight months of 2023 are already up 88 percent compared to all of 2022."
Why are so many cars getting stolen? Police departments and city officials point to this: Millions of Kias and Hyundais are ridiculously easy to steal.
For years now, most automakers have equipped most of the cars they sell in the United States with electronic immobilizers, devices that prevent cars from starting unless they detect a radio ID code associated with the car's rightful key. But Hyundai and Kia, which come under the same South Korean conglomerate, did not install this basic device in somewhere around nine million cars sold between 2011 and 2022. A couple of years ago, videos showing how to hotwire the vulnerable cars began to pop up online. I won't go into details but I will say that it doesn't require much more than a USB plug.
The resulting crime wave has clobbered American cities. "We're hitting close to 6,000 cars that have been stolen this year alone," Adrian Diaz, Seattle's police chief, told me. More than a third of the cars stolen in Seattle in August were Hyundais and Kias, he said. "That's a massive cost, not only for the victim of having a vehicle stolen," but also in resources involved in "trying to investigate these crimes," Diaz said.
And then there are the follow-on incidents. Stolen Kias and Hyundais have been involved in numerous deadly crashes, armed robbery sprees and other crimes around the country. "We're recovering guns out of a lot of Kias that are stolen," Diaz said.
Seattle is one of several cities that are suing Kia and Hyundai, and they make a compelling case. The carmakers should have known they were creating unsafe products. The costs of their decision have had far-reaching effects on public safety and city resources, and there's no telling when the thefts might abate. Kia and Hyundai, not the public, should bear the cost of their irresponsible decision to sell cars without immobilizers.
The carmakers say they're doing all they can to stem the thefts. They've created a software update that they say fixes the issue; it requires a visit to a dealer and takes up to 45 minutes to install. They've also given police departments anti-theft steering wheel locks to hand out to affected owners, they say. So far, about 21 percent of affected cars -- about 660,000 Kias and 811,000 Hyundais -- have had the software upgrade installed, the carmakers said. (After you get the upgrade, the carmakers will give you a window sticker to alert thieves that they're wasting their time with your ride -- a good idea, I guess, though it does place a lot of faith in the integrity of would-be criminals.) The companies have also settled a $ 200 million lawsuit with owners of the vulnerable cars (though a federal judge recently rejected the settlement, ruling that it may not offer enough compensation for some drivers). A Kia spokesman told me that the cities' lawsuits are "without merit," arguing that federal auto safety regulators do not require automakers to install immobilizers in their vehicles. (A lawsuit filed by several insurance companies disputes this point.)
It may also be difficult for cities to prove that the rise in thefts is primarily Kia and Hyundai's fault. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist who is one of the authors of the Council on Criminal Justice's analysis, told me that motor vehicle theft is an under-researched phenomenon. Many police departments do not "code" the make and model of stolen cars, so it's difficult to make long-term comparisons. "I cannot tell you what fraction of all motor vehicles that are stolen are Kias and Hyundais," he said.
But stats released by some of the worst affected cities strongly suggest that thefts of Kias and Hyundais are a major part of the recent spike. In the first half of 2022, according to the Chicago mayor's office, there were about 500 stolen Kias and Hyundais in Chicago. In the second half of 2022, the number of stolen Kias and Hyundais shot up to 8,350; this year, more than half of the cars stolen in Chicago were from these two brands. In August, Cleveland.com reported that Kias and Hyundais made up 57 percent of cars stolen this year, compared to 11 percent during the same period last year. In May, the Baltimore mayor's office announced the city's suit against the carmakers, reporting that Kias and Hyundais accounted for 41 percent of the cars stolen up to that point this year. (Hyundai and Kia accounted for just over 10 percent of the cars sold in America in the first quarter of this year, according to the research firm Cox Automotive.)
There's a chance that Kia and Hyundai will escape some of the blame for these thefts because there's a juicier target for politicians to go after: social media platforms, where the how-to videos have circulated.
Media accounts of the thefts often highlight TikTok's role; one Insider story was headlined "Grand Theft TikTok." In March, Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, held a news conference to discuss the city's response to the rise in stolen cars. After pointing out the steps Hyundai and Kia have taken to prevent the thefts, he went after tech companies. "We don't need social media to contribute to social disorder," he said. The same month, Representative Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat, told reporters, "We don't need companies like TikTok playing an active role in facilitating these crimes and putting information on how-to videos for people who would misuse them."
This strikes me as bizarre blame shifting. It's Kia and Hyundai, not TikTok, that sold theft-prone cars. I'm not against tech companies moderating their platforms to curb the spread of potentially dangerous information. But you know what would be better? Making cars that can't be stolen with a USB cable.

Getting Vaccines Is Key As Other Viruses Swirl: [National Desk]

Full text: Good morning. We offer a guide to fall vaccine shots -- and also have the latest on the Proud Boys, Mitch McConnell and the British Museum.
A vaccine clinic at Seattle Children's Hospital last year.Jovelle Tamayo for The New York TimesWhether over whenCovid cases have risen. Flu season is approaching. And new vaccines for the virus known as R.S.V. recently became available.
This swirl of developments has left many people wondering which vaccine shots they should be getting and when. Today's newsletter offers a guide.
The main message that I heard from experts is that Americans should shift how they think about respiratory viruses. For the past few cold-weather seasons (which are also when viruses spread most), we obsessed over Covid. This year, we should take a broader approach. "It's not only Covid you have to think about," said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and the author of a forthcoming book, "The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science."
The good news is that there are vaccines and treatments that reduce risks from all major viruses likely to circulate this season, including Covid. "For the past couple of seasons, the notion was that Covid controlled us," Dr. Nirav Shah, the C.D.C.'s principal deputy director, told me. "The tables have turned, not just for Covid but for the others."
1. R.S.V.
The most immediate step worth considering involves R.S.V., which stands for respiratory syncytial virus. It is a common winter virus that usually causes mild cold-like illness but can be dangerous for young children and older adults, as Emily Martin, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, has told The Times.
This spring, the federal government approved the first R.S.V. vaccines, for people aged 60 and older. If you qualify, consider getting your R.S.V. vaccine shot now. Shah, the C.D.C. official, recently urged his mother to do so. Hotez, who's 65, has received his own R.S.V. shot.
Why now? R.S.V. tends to circulate somewhat earlier than the flu. If you're 60 or over, "you don't want to get into November without having an R.S.V. vaccine," said Dr. Ashish Jha, the former White House Covid adviser and current dean of Brown University's public health school.
What about infants? Although there is no R.S.V. vaccine for them, children under 8 months (and some who are older) can receive an advance antibody treatment to prevent severe illness. Parents may want to ask their pediatrician about it. It's sufficiently new that not all doctors have it yet.
2. Influenza
The flu officially kills about 35,000 Americans in a typical year, and the true toll is probably higher. As Jha told me, the flu also weakens the body in ways that make heart attacks and strokes more common, especially among the elderly. "We underestimate the impact that respiratory viruses have on our population," he said. "The flu can knock people out for weeks, even younger people."
Yet the flu's toll would be lower if more people got a vaccine shot. In recent years, less than half of Americans have done so.
This year's flu vaccine shots are now available at drugstores, hospitals, doctor's offices and elsewhere. You may want to wait until late September or October to get one, though. The heaviest parts of flu season tend to occur between December and February. If you wait, the shot's protection against severe illness will still be near its strongest level during those months.
3. Covid
The best defenses against Covid haven't changed: vaccines and post-infection treatments. They are especially important for vulnerable people, like the elderly and the immunocompromised. "Overwhelmingly, those who are being hospitalized are unvaccinated or undervaccinated," Hotez said.
The federal government is on track to approve updated Covid vaccine shots, designed to combat recent variants, in mid-September. Once it does, all adults should consider getting a booster shot. Many Americans have now gone more than a year without one, and immunity has waned.
Yes, severe Covid remains rare in people under 50, especially if they have received a vaccine shot or had the virus -- and nearly all Americans fall into one or both categories. But Covid can still be nasty even if it doesn't put you in the hospital. A booster shot will reduce its potency.
Shah argues that children (over 6 months old) should also get a Covid shot this fall, even though their own Covid risk is very low. "We should be thinking bigger than just ourselves," he told me. "Do you want to see your grandpa? Do you want to hang out with your grandma? Are you really sure you're not going to give Covid to them?" Even some boosted older people get severe versions of Covid.
A good strategy for many people may be to get their Covid booster and flu shot at the same time, in late September or October.
And if you're older and you get Covid, talk to a doctor about taking Paxlovid or a different treatment. It can make a big difference. "When I get Covid," said Jha, who's 52 and healthy, "I have every intention of taking Paxlovid."
The bottom lineI've offered specific advice here about the ideal time to get different vaccine shots. But don't exaggerate the importance of timing. As Shah said, "What I care more about is that you get all three shots if you're eligible rather than when you get all three."
Politics
Donald Trump pleaded not guilty in the Georgia criminal case over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, waiving an in-person arraignment.Justice Clarence Thomas formally disclosed private flights, luxury trips and a real estate transaction with Harlan Crow, a billionaire conservative donor.A former Proud Boys leader received a 17-year prison sentence for plotting to attack the Capitol."We need 50 million bucks": With Ron DeSantis lagging Trump, the chief strategist of DeSantis's super PAC made an urgent plea to donors.Mitch McConnellCongress's attending physician called Senator Mitch McConnell "medically clear" to work after he froze up at a news conference for a second time.Three senators named John -- Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso -- are among the possible successors if McConnell steps down as Republican leader.
War in Ukraine
Small Ukrainian advances like retaking the village of Robotyne are providing a morale boost for both Ukrainian troops and the public. New Russian high school textbooks seek to justify the war.
International
The building in Johannesburg where at least 74 people died in a fire was a refuge for desperate families seeking an affordable place to live. Pope Francis landed in Mongolia, home to fewer than 1,500 Catholics but bordering China and Russia, whose leaders have thwarted his ambitions.

Hyundai and LG Planning Infusion for Georgia Plant
Hyundai and LG Energy Solution said Thursday that they would spend an additional $ 2 billion and hire an extra 400 workers to make batteries at the automaker's electrical vehicle plant that's under construction in Georgia. The announcement by the South Korea-based companies expands on a partnership they began three months ago to produce batteries at the same site west of Savannah where Hyundai plans to start E.V. production in 2025. The news brings the companies' total investment in the Georgia plant to more than $ 7.5 billion and the site's overall planned work force to 8,500. It's not clear whether the additional investment and jobs announced Thursday mean the Hyundai/LG battery plant will produce more batteries. When the joint venture was first announced in May, the companies said they would supply batteries for 300,000 E.V.s a year. Hyundai has said the Georgia plant could later expand to build 500,000 vehicles annually. ASSOCIATED PRESS

J.C. Penney Will Spend $ 1 Billion on Upgrades
J.C. Penney said Thursday that it planned to spend more than $ 1 billion by the end of 2025 in a bid to revive the storied 121-year-old department store chain. The money is going toward remodeling stores, upgrading its online shopping site and app, and making its supply network more efficient. Under the plan, checkout stations that had been located throughout J.C. Penney's stores will be replaced with a single area of cashiers. Store employees will be equipped with mobile devices to scan inventory and ring up shoppers' purchases. And the chain is making upgrades to its Wi-Fi networks to speed up instore connections. The chain, which emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in December 2020, targets budget-conscious families, whose median income ranges from $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 and who have been hit hard by higher costs basic items and high interest rates, making borrowing on credit cards and taking out a mortgage more expensive.

BIG TECH
Microsoft Unravels Bundle To Head Off E.U. Action
Microsoft said on Thursday that it would stop packaging its Teams videoconferencing app with its Office software in Europe in an effort to head off antitrust penalties by regulators. It also said it would take steps to make it easier for competing products to work alongside its software. The announcement comes a month after the European Union's executive Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top competition enforcer, opened a formal investigation over concerns that bundling Teams with Office gives the company an unfair edge. The investigation was triggered by a complaint filed in 2020 by Slack Technologies, maker of popular workplace messaging software. Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, argued that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.

A Onetime Bad Boy Figures Things Out: [Sports Desk]

Full text: After numerous misfires with his career, Paul, an American seeded 14th at the U.S. Open, finds himself as comfortable on the court as off it, and into the second round in Queens.
The last time Tommy Paul needed an attitude adjustment, he had just flamed out of a small tournament in the Netherlands in the spring of 2022 in the most petulant way, and his coach had seen enough.
Brad Stine, who guided Jim Courier to four Grand Slam singles titles and the world's top ranking and coached several other top players of the past 20 years, is 64 years old and knows when a player has crossed the line from battling through a rough patch into behaving unprofessionally.
For several weeks, he had watched Paul act like a child instead of a man in his mid-20s. During an opening-round match in Geneva that May, Paul had mocked someone sitting in the player box of his opponent, Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands. Paul thought the man was cheering too loudly. Another time, in the grass-court tournament in 's Hertogenbosch, he had disrespected Brandon Nakashima, a fellow American, yelling that he should not have been losing to a player he felt he was much better than.
Stine's kids are grown and his bills are paid. He has been to tennis' mountaintop. He doesn't need the work. He needed to tell Paul exactly what he believed, and if their three-year player-coach relationship ended there, so be it.
"You're embarrassing me," Stine told Paul as they talked in a quiet spot at the tournament after the loss to Nakashima. Then he rattled off his complaints about Paul's attitude and competitiveness during the previous month.
Paul absorbed Stine's words for a few moments before he spoke, then told Stine he didn't disagree with anything he had said.
Among the top American men, Frances Tiafoe, a 25-year-old son of immigrants from Sierra Leone whose run to the U.S. Open semifinals last year was electrifying, sucks up most of the oxygen these days. Taylor Fritz, the 25-year-old Californian, has the highest ranking among the group and last year won the BNP Paribas Open, the so-called fifth Slam. Sebastian Korda, the son of a Grand Slam singles champion, has the pedigree.
But Paul, 26, who has a dangerous, all-court playing style, who likes to hold a rod and reel in his hands as much as (OK, maybe more than) a tennis racket, has arguably had the best season of them all.
He is the only American man to make a semifinal of a Grand Slam tournament, falling to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open, which Djokovic went on to win for a record 10th time. Paul's ranking shot up to No. 13 this month, from No. 35 in January. He has given Carlos Alcaraz, the world No. 1, fits during the past month, beating him for the second time in his career in Toronto, then falling in three tight sets to him a week later in the Cincinnati suburbs.
The rewards, including nearly $ 2 million in prize money, have begun rolling in. His agents at GSE Worldwide have gotten Paul new endorsement deals with Yonex, a racket manufacturer; De Bethune, the maker of his luxury watch; Motorola; IBM; Acorns, a financial management firm; and Celsius, a beverage maker. He appeared in a fashion photo spread in Vanity Fair, his hair slicked down and his body wrapped in a shiny overcoat.
"Not really my thing," said Paul, who is more suited to a trucker hat and a hoody than haute couture.
This was the way it was supposed to go for Paul, who was almost always the best in his age group among American junior players. He won the French Open junior title in 2015. But then came a frustrating climb up the tennis ladder, years when Paul's desire and commitment to his craft failed to match the talent that he had showcased from the time he was a small boy, and he learned the hard way that talent only gets a player so far.
"He was the big fish in the little pond, and then he got out there and realized, these other players they're better, and they're working harder, too," said his mother and first coach, Jill MacMillan, who was courtside for Paul's four-set, first-round win over Stefano Travaglia of Italy on Monday. She and her husband live on a small farm in South Jersey, with two horses, eight sheep and various other animals.
In talking about his journey later that night, Paul was philosophical.
"I don't think I ever really stopped believing," he said. "I kind of knew that I could make it. I just didn't really know how to do it."
Or if he really wanted to.
Growing up in Greenville, N.C., where his mother and her ex-husband owned and operated a health club with some tennis courts, Paul received his first tennis racket from an older woman whom Paul and his siblings called Grandma Betty -- she wasn't their grandmother -- when, he thinks, he was about 5 years old. He promptly went outside and started banging it against a tree. She followed him out and told him that wasn't how he was supposed to use it.
Paul and his older sister started spending every afternoon playing tennis at the health club. Beating his sister, who would go on to play collegiate tennis, was his earliest goal. MacMillan said that when Paul started playing -- and winning -- tournaments at age 6, he barely knew the rules or how to keep score. "He just loved to hit the ball."
That love never faded, even as Paul played plenty of baseball and basketball before focusing exclusively on tennis when he was about 13. Then tennis got serious and a little weird.
He has vivid memories of seeing parents hitting their children for losing tournaments. His parents could not afford intensive private coaching, so Paul began to spend much of his time practicing at the United States Tennis Association's training grounds in Florida. There were a lot of rules and a lot of coaches telling Paul what to do, such as to limit his time with friends and family. Sometimes he listened and followed the rules and practiced hard. Sometimes he didn't. He still won plenty, so there weren't many repercussions.
He planned on attending the University of Georgia. But then he started winning lower tier pro tournaments and captured the junior title at the French Open. So instead of going to college he turned professional.
Big mistake. No agents wanted to represent him because of his reputation as a player with questionable commitment, Paul said. For the next two years, he was miserable. That misery boiled over at the 2017 U.S. Open, when the aftereffects of a night of indulgence after a first-round loss in singles led to a 6-0, 6-0 loss in a doubles match. A falling out with the U.S.T.A, ultimately resulting in his loss of support, ensued over the next several months.
"That was a different life," Paul said last week while sitting on a couch in a home in Southampton on Long Island, where he was a guest of the chairman of GSE, his agency.
Paul said losing the support from the U.S.T.A. was the best thing that could have happened to him. Finally, he had to take responsibility for his future in tennis, hiring his own trainer and coach. He stopped going through the motions in the gym and on the practice court.
"I wasn't going to waste my investment," he said.
The biggest one came in 2019, when following a loss in the U.S. Open qualifying tournament, he asked Stine, whose main player was battling injuries, to evaluate his game.
As he watched Paul play, Stine didn't understand how such a gifted athlete could so often be off balance on the court. He gave him a list of 11 things to fix, everything from improving his footwork to developing a slice. He shared his "conversion theory," that all it takes to completely shift the momentum of any game regardless of the score is winning three points in a row.
"Do the math," Stine said. He's not wrong.
When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Paul and his compatriots spent much of their time in Southern California, playing at the Los Angeles-area mansions of tennis enthusiasts. He was still getting used to feeling like he belonged.
Eight days before the U.S. Open, Paul was fishing for tuna off Long Island. His face lights up as he talks about the hourlong fight to land a 350-pounder too big to keep. He has yet to buy his own boat, but has been pricing them out. The next day he was on the court of another seaside mansion practicing for two hours with Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.
"I want him to continue to have fun," Stine said later at the mansion they were calling home for the pretournament week.
Was Paul having fun? His eyes went to the sprawling lawn and the pool and backyard tennis court.
"Look where we are," he said.

Full text: The News
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, plans to kick off a series of listening sessions next month on the regulation of artificial intelligence with Elon Musk of Tesla, Sundar Pichai of Google, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Satya Nadella of Microsoft.
Mr. Schumer's office said on Monday that the tech leaders were set to convene in Washington on Sept. 13 for the first of several meetings for lawmakers to hear from A.I. experts. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, and Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, will also attend.
The "A.I. insight forums" are closed-door listening sessions for lawmakers as they try to devise regulations for A.I. technologies. Mr. Schumer, the majority leader, said the sessions were intended to educate members of Congress on the risks posed by A.I. on jobs, the spread of disinformation and intellectual property theft. Lawmakers will also learn about opportunities created by the technology in the field of research on diseases, his office said.
The Sept. 13 meeting will also include members from civil rights and labor groups and the creative community. Axios reported earlier on the details of the meeting.
Why It Matters
The guest list for the Sept. 13 forum signals the important role that tech companies will play in the creation of A.I. regulations.
To influence the debate, some tech chiefs have voiced their views on A.I. regulations to lawmakers. Mr. Altman, for instance, has become a fixture on Capitol Hill, appearing at a congressional hearing this year and meeting with more than 100 lawmakers.
Lawmakers and the White House have also leaned on the tech executives for guidance on regulations. Last month, the White House announced that Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and Meta had agreed to voluntary safeguards around their A.I. technology, including stress-testing their systems for security flaws.

But many tech companies disagree on regulations. OpenAI and Microsoft have supported the idea of having one agency regulate the technology, a proposal that IBM and Google have opposed. Mr. Musk, who also owns X, the company formerly known as Twitter, has called for a moratorium on developing some of the most advanced uses of A.I., while other tech leaders have disagreed with that approach.
Background
The United States is behind on global regulations. Europe this year is expected to enact an A.I. law that would curtail facial recognition technology and force companies like OpenAI to disclose sources of data for their technology.
The Sept. 13 meeting is set to begin a long-awaited process on rules in the United States for A.I. In June, Mr. Schumer announced a plan to start "from scratch" and educate lawmakers to come up with legislation that strikes a balance between encouraging the technology's development and protecting individuals.
Mr. Schumer said he would host forums to learn about the risks and potential opportunities of A.I. from technologists, academics, and civil rights and labor groups. The forums could help shape legislation that could be introduced within the year.

Union's Actions in Georgia Aim to Raise the Heat On Biden and Automakers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A coalition of unions and civic groups is pushing one of the world's largest automakers to protect and train workers in return for federal money under President Biden's signature laws.
A coalition of labor unions and civic groups in Georgia and Alabama will launch a pressure campaign on Monday targeting Hyundai's electric vehicle plants and its clean energy suppliers, an effort that could also push the Biden administration to make good on its oft-repeated pledge to create not just jobs but "good union jobs."
By focusing on the shift to electric vehicles at Hyundai, a nonunion carmaker expected to reap huge benefits from Mr. Biden's prized initiatives, the coalition hopes to make inroads at other automakers, such as B.M.W. in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama, which similarly chose union-hostile territory for their American manufacturing bases.
The campaign could also raise the heat on domestic automakers in the middle of contract negotiations with the newly aggressive United Automobile Workers union, which is focused on raising wages at electric vehicle suppliers like battery makers.
For Mr. Biden, the Hyundai campaign has political ramifications, in setting specific demands on one of the largest automakers in the world in one of the most important swing states in the 2024 presidential election, Georgia.
"The people in the community should be able to come to work in these plants, with a livable wage and good jobs," said Yvonne T. Brooks, president of the Georgia State A.F.L.-C.I.O., adding that "to bring jobs here but not provide a livable wage kind of defeats the purpose."
Mr. Biden has campaigned on the sheer number of jobs created by his three signature laws, a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change. A $ 25 million advertising blitz announced by his campaign last week kicked off with a one-minute spot that proclaims, "Manufacturing jobs are coming home," and "America is leading the world in clean energy."
But despite low unemployment, tempering inflation and steady job creation, Mr. Biden's overall approval ratings have been dragged down by voters' refusal to give him credit for the good economic news. Clifford Young, who oversees U.S. public opinion research at Ipsos, a polling company, said that last year's 8.5 percent inflation and the ensuing interest rate hikes and slower economic growth might have sealed Mr. Biden's fate with the voting public.
"The dirty secret is a bad economy hurts a president more than a good economy helps," he said.
White House officials, who were notified of the Hyundai effort ahead of time, said Thursday that Mr. Biden fully backs the aims of the coalition in Georgia. And labor leaders have generally supported Mr. Biden as the most pro-union president ever.
But in a notable shift, those leaders also say the volume of jobs created on his watch may not be enough to win worker loyalties if those jobs are low-paid, dangerous and insecure. That is especially true if substandard jobs are underwritten by the taxpayer.
"I know the president can't make stipulations that all new jobs have to go to union workers, but there have to be fair labor standards for jobs that are supported by tax dollars," said David Green, the United Automobile Workers' regional director for Ohio and Indiana. "Members are a little frustrated with it. It's our tax dollars, too."
Such concerns have led the U.A.W. to withhold its endorsement of Mr. Biden as the union's new leadership threatens to strike over wages and benefits at electric vehicle suppliers. Mr. Biden has responded with support, tapping a senior adviser and Democratic veteran, Gene B. Sperling, as liaison between the union and the automakers and backing the U.A.W. this month in contract negotiations.
But union leaders are worried about the transition that Mr. Biden has set in motion with his push to address climate change with federal money funding the shift from fossil fuels. They are pressing automakers shifting to electric vehicles to "honor the right to organize," take necessary steps to avoid plant closings, and provide training programs to help workers transition into new jobs at comparable wages.
A letter to the chief executive of Hyundai's American subsidiary, José Muñoz, signed by coalition members including the U.A.W., the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (which is particularly close to Mr. Biden), and religious, community and environmental groups, maps key labor demands.
Such letters, demanding "community benefits agreements" enforced with binding arbitration systems, have been trotted out in the past to little effect. But union leaders said the Hyundai effort is more focused and forward-looking, hinting at the strategy of organizers in the South as unions across the country have become much more aggressive.
The letter pushes for Hyundai and its subsidiaries to hire locally, train workers from the communities around the plants, bolster safety standards, and protect the environment around the plants, which are expected to employ more than 30,000 Georgians and Alabamians. Of those, 12,750 are expected to work at or around Hyundai's new electric vehicle "megasite" in Bryan County near Savannah, the largest economic development project in Georgia's history.
The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45 percent of new hires and 20 percent of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
"These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best," the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make "highroad commitments to workers and their communities."
A spokesman for Hyundai U.S.A., Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company's "top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America's auto industry forward."
Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.
At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Mr. Flippo said, he told them, "Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don't follow up, it shouldn't be up to the union organizers to do it for you."
Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Mr. Biden's three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Ga., plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.
Mr. Flippo credited a rule in the electric school bus grants that said no federal money could be used to oppose union organizing, such as in hiring union-busting law firms during an organizing drive.
"They did use some of those tactics," he said, "but all we had to say was we were going to notify the government and request an audit of where their money was going, and it went away."
The Biden administration has had some successes with clean energy companies, securing commitments by a Danish wind energy giant to use union labor on its offshore wind projects and by a North Dakota metals company to stay neutral in any union drive at its new battery plant.
But union leaders have only so much influence over the rank and file -- and against the pull of Donald J. Trump, who has made working-class appeals central to his political movement. Mr. Green pointed to the former president's promise to revive a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, by enticing an untested start-up to buy the facility. That start-up, Lordstown Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June.
"I will not, could not support any endorsement of Donald Trump," he said. "But we've got a lot of members. Do I think that Trump's rhetoric is contagious among our members? Absolutely."

Ahead of 2024, Biden Builds a Platform on Health Care Costs: [National Desk]

Full text: By David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick
Good morning. We're covering Biden's focus on health costs, story B and story C.
Dr. Spend Less
As his re-election effort gets underway, President Biden is signaling that health care -- and particularly the cost of it -- will be central to his campaign.
"We're taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down," he has said. "I'm just tired of seeing Americans ripped off," he said last month. Tomorrow, he will hold an event at the White House at which he is expected to announce the first 10 drugs that will be part of a new program in which Medicare officials can negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce drug prices.
Biden is emphasizing the cost of health care partly because it has been one of his administration's biggest priorities, even if other policies -- such as those on the climate and infrastructure -- receive more attention. His administration has reduced the cost of hearing aids, reduced the cost of health insurance for people who buy it though an Obamacare exchange and reduced an array of expenses for Medicare recipients.
"Millions of people benefit from the health care provisions," Larry Levitt, an executive vice president at KFF, a health care research group, told us. Some people, he added, will save "a lot of money."
Biden and his aides understand that these policies are popular with swing voters, who, as this newsletter has described before, tend to lean left on economic issues while being more conservative on many social issues. That's particularly true of swing voters who don't have a four-year college degree. The president has described his health care policies as part of "Bidenomics in action."
"If you look at the polling data, it's overwhelmingly popular, what we've proposed," Biden said earlier this year. "Matter of fact, it's a hell of a lot more popular than I am."
Today's newsletter delves into the specifics -- and some of the criticisms -- of Biden's health care agenda.
The Medicare provisions
The Inflation Reduction Act -- a law that Biden signed last year, centered on clean-energy funding -- also includes measures to lower drug costs for Medicare recipients. Virtually every American age 65 and older is on Medicare, and many will save hundreds of dollars a year in out-of-pocket expenses. Those who spend the most on drugs will likely save a few thousand dollars a year, according to KFF.
Where do those savings comes from?
■ As of this past January, the law caps a Medicare recipient's out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $ 35 per month. The cap will save about 1.5 million Americans almost $ 500 a year on average.
■ A provision allows Medicare recipients to receive some vaccines, like those for shingles and tetanus, at no charge.
■ The law caps a recipient's total spending on prescription drugs at $ 2,000 a year, although the provision will not take effect until 2025, after the upcoming presidential campaign.
■ The law penalizes pharmaceutical companies that increase drug prices faster than the overall rate of inflation; in recent years, half of the drugs Medicare covered would have qualified. The law also includes the policy that allows Medicare officials to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices.
Those last couple of provisions will probably have a bigger effect on the government's health care spending than on household spending. But less government spending still benefits Americans in the long run by reducing the need for taxes.
Beyond Medicare
People under 65 don't benefit as much from Biden's agenda, but many do benefit to some degree:
■ The Inflation Reduction Act increased tax subsidies for Americans who get health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. More than 13 million people will each save about $ 800 a year on average. The policy is temporary, expiring in 2026.
■ An executive order that Biden signed in 2021 led the F.D.A. to allow drugstores and other retailers to sell hearing aids over the counter. The change reduced the cost of hearing aids by more than half. Before the change, the average cost of hearing aids was about $ 5,000.
■ Biden is trying to close some loopholes that some hospitals and insurers have used to continue sending large, unexpected bills, despite a bipartisan 2020 law, signed by Donald Trump, to prevent the practice.
Potential problems
The underlying reason for Biden's push is that Americans pay more for medical care than the citizens of any other county. There are several causes, but many experts believe that the main factor is simply that the U.S. government doesn't prevent drug companies, hospitals and insurers from charging high prices. An influential 2003 article in an academic journal made this argument bluntly in its headline: "It's the prices, stupid." These high prices translate into higher profits for health care companies.
Still, there are some potential advantages to the U.S. system. High prices create an incentive for companies to develop new drugs, some of which save lives. Four of the world's five largest drug companies are based in the U.S. The pharmaceutical industry warns that lower Medicare prices may hamper innovation, although many independent analysts -- including those at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office -- predict any such effect will be minor.
Another possible unintended consequence is that drug companies will respond to lower Medicare prices by increasing prices for people on private insurance. If that happened, it would effectively shift money from younger Americans to older Americans, and would probably worsen economic inequality.
Most experts are also relatively sanguine about these potential downsides. But, as Levitt told us, "The truth is, we don't know."
Looking ahead: Biden has suggested that if he wins re-election, he will try to take more steps to reduce medical costs. Among them: making Obamacare subsidies permanent and capping insulin costs for privately insured Americans. "There's more to do," Biden has said.

But in a notable shift, those leaders also say the volume of jobs created on his watch might not be enough to win worker loyalties if those jobs are low-paid, dangerous and insecure. That is especially true if substandard jobs are underwritten by the taxpayer.
“I know the president can’t make stipulations that all new jobs have to go to union workers, but there have to be fair labor standards for jobs that are supported by tax dollars,” said David Green, the United Automobile Workers’ regional director for Ohio and Indiana. “Members are a little frustrated with it. It’s our tax dollars, too.”
Such concerns have led the UAW to withhold its endorsement of Biden as the union’s new leadership threatens to strike over wages and benefits at electric vehicle suppliers. Biden has responded with support, tapping a senior adviser and Democratic veteran, Gene B. Sperling, as liaison between the union and the automakers and backing the UAW this month in contract negotiations.
But union leaders are worried about the transition that Biden has set in motion with his push to address climate change with federal money funding the shift from fossil fuels. They are pressing automakers shifting to electric vehicles to “honor the right to organize,” take necessary steps to avoid plant closings, and provide training programs to help workers transition into new jobs at comparable wages.
A letter to the chief executive of Hyundai’s American subsidiary, José Muñoz, signed by coalition members including the UAW, the AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (which is particularly close to Biden), and religious, community and environmental groups, maps key labor demands.
Such letters, demanding “community benefits agreements” enforced with binding arbitration systems, have been trotted out in the past to little effect. But union leaders said the Hyundai effort is more focused and forward-looking, hinting at the strategy of organizers in the South as unions across the country have become much more aggressive.
The letter pushes for Hyundai and its subsidiaries to hire locally, train workers from the communities around the plants, bolster safety standards, and protect the environment around the plants, which are expected to employ more than 30,000 Georgians and Alabamians. Of those, 12,750 are expected to work at or around Hyundai’s new electric vehicle “megasite” in Bryan County near Savannah, the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.
The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45% of new hires and 20% of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
“These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best,” the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make “highroad commitments to workers and their communities.”
A spokesperson for Hyundai USA, Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company’s “top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America’s auto industry forward.”
Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.
At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Flippo said, he told them, “Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don’t follow up, it shouldn’t be up to the union organizers to do it for you.”
Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Biden’s three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Georgia, plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.
Flippo credited a rule in the electric school bus grants that said no federal money could be used to oppose union organizing, such as in hiring union-busting law firms during an organizing drive.
“They did use some of those tactics,” he said, “but all we had to say was we were going to notify the government and request an audit of where their money was going, and it went away.”
The Biden administration has had some successes with clean energy companies, securing commitments by a Danish wind energy giant to use union labor on its offshore wind projects and by a North Dakota metals company to stay neutral in any union drive at its new battery plant.
But union leaders have only so much influence over the rank and file — and against the pull of Donald Trump, who has made working-class appeals central to his political movement. Green pointed to the former president’s promise to revive a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, by enticing an untested startup to buy the facility. That startup, Lordstown Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June.
“I will not, could not support any endorsement of Donald Trump,” he said. “But we’ve got a lot of members. Do I think that Trump’s rhetoric is contagious among our members? Absolutely.”

Let's Stop Pretending College Degrees Don't Matter: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It would be easy to believe, from scanning the headlines, that a college degree is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a fast-evolving job market.
Fourteen states, including 10 in the past year alone, have dropped degree requirements for many state jobs. The trend is gathering steam at many high-profile businesses, notably tech firms like IBM and Accenture. All this comes as college enrollment has dropped, with an assist from a tight job market and worries about student debt.
In a world marked by continued racial disparities in employment and economic well-being, there is a growing outcry that expensive college degrees represent a barrier rather than a steppingstone. The argument goes: Many talented people, including disadvantaged minorities, may possess the skills needed for many white-collar roles without holding the formal credentials listed as prerequisites.
These advocates, who can be found on the left and the right, mean well. Nonetheless, a look at the data suggests the skills-based hiring movement may actually amount to little more than populist virtue signaling. The evidence so far suggests that the movement may do little to expand economic opportunity. What's worse, it sends a degree-skeptical message that risks hurting rather than helping those who would benefit most from pursuing an education beyond high school.
As always, it's useful to look at what economists call "revealed preferences" -- or what people do, regardless of what they say.
The economic advantage of getting a college degree remains at just about an all-time high when compared with the average earnings of Americans with only a high-school diploma. In recent years, a typical college graduate earned a median wage premium of more than $ 30,000, or almost 75 percent more than those who had completed just high school, a 2019 New York Fed analysis found.
In April 2022, a major study by the Society for Human Resource Management, or S.H.R.M., found that 71 percent of executives said that some alternative credentials are equivalent to a bachelor's degree. But only 58 percent of supervisors (most likely beneath those executives on the organization chart) concurred, a figure that fell to 36 percent for human resources professionals, or those typically closest to hiring decisions.
In another experiment by S.H.R.M., hiring managers and human resources professionals evaluated hypothetical job applicants with traditional degrees more highly than those with alternative credentials, particularly when the job ad used strict degree requirements. This was the case even when the latter were viewed as more likely to have the technical skills needed for the job.
Another study often cited as evidence of declining employer interest in college degrees doesn't fully capture what's happening. The Burning Glass Institute's "Emerging Degree Reset" report from last year pointed to a decline in degree requirements for middle-skill jobs in particular. But the analysis was based on online job postings, not actual hiring decisions. A later data analysis found that in some key respects, "employers are hiring more (not less) college grads."
What about all the Silicon Valley firms so often associated with the "death of the degree" narrative? Here, too, revealed preferences are, well, revealing.
Degree requirements in formal job listings remain in the 70 to 90 percent range at blue-chip firms like Google, Apple and Intel. Even much-hyped alternative-credential programs -- like the online Grow with Google certificates, which offer professional training in high-demand tech fields such as cybersecurity and digital support -- aren't designed to get certificate holders hired at Google.
Maggie Johnson, Google's vice president of education and university programs, told me that although the company has made a small number of hires from top coding boot camps, "I still doubt that boot camp graduates can learn new languages and technologies as quickly as someone with" a computer science degree.
There is a reason college graduates earn so much more, and it isn't just because they've got an extra piece of paper. The huge growth in the wage premium for college degrees reflects not state bureaucracies or corporate H.R. policies, but century-long economic changes that generate more jobs requiring the abilities and knowledge acquired in college.
The broad education and targeted skills that college graduates usually obtain prepare them for career success. That includes analytical and communications abilities, tailored preparation in popular subjects like business, nursing and computer science, or liberal arts majors that have significant long-term benefits. When undergrads are also able to develop their social capital to build professional networks, so much the better. It's a category error to treat college degrees like dubious occupational licenses that have become barriers to entry in certain fields.
College degree alternatives may still play a worthwhile role for some students. For all the benefits that accrue to earning traditional two- and four-year degrees, large populations of learners need something different. Tailored, short-term, skills-based programs and credentials in everything from data science to graphic design should be widely accessible -- and they should be simple to acquire and reacquire over a lifetime, to meet changing needs. Whenever possible, students should be able to combine them, over time, into two- or four-year degrees. Remember, much of the growth in skills-based credentials seems to be coming from people who already have degrees and want to supplement them with additional skills. They're taking a "both/and" approach to get ahead, not giving up on degrees altogether.
We often hear that the strong preference for degrees isn't fair to the majority of Americans who didn't go to college. But that majority is falling fast, and the percentage of college-educated American adults is pushing 50 percent when associate degrees are included. And while the percentage of Black and Latino college graduates is significantly lower, it is far higher than a few decades earlier. In fact, in 1960, only 41 percent of Americans had completed high school. It might have been plausible then to argue that plenty of dropouts had great talents and were unfairly penalized by high school diploma requirements. But it would have been badly misguided to oppose efforts to vastly improve high school graduation rates, which stand at 91 percent today.
College degree requirements aren't sacred. But they reflect the unmistakable reality that higher education helps people do well.

John Warnock, Adobe Co-Founder Who Invented the PDF, Dies at 82: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a founder of Adobe Systems, he oversaw the development of software and systems that made modern personal computing possible.
John Warnock, a founder of Adobe Systems whose innovations in computer graphics, including the ubiquitous PDF, made possible today's visually rich digital experiences, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 82.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started in 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.
Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an arduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on either a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or a specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $ 10,000 and take up most of a room.
Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop printers themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer sent them. Adobe's first such protocol, PostScript, went into Apple's revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a few years it was the industry standard.
PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware companies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely unknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a program designed to render and read files in what it called a Portable Document Format, or PDF.
The PDF was the result of Dr. Warnock's abiding obsession since graduate school: finding a way to ensure that the graphics displayed on one computer -- whether words or images -- looked the exact same on another computer, or on a page from a printer, regardless of the manufacturer.
"It had been a holy grail in computer science to figure out how to communicate documents," he said in a 2019 interview with Oxford University.
Acrobat and the PDF were not immediately successful, even after Adobe made its Acrobat Reader free to download. The company's board wanted to retire them, but Dr. Warnock persisted.
"I think the crossover point is if I can go to General Motors and say, 'I can deliver your information more quickly and more cheaply than you can on paper,"' he told The New York Times in 1991. "You're talking about savings of tens of millions of dollars."
The PDF eventually became standard, as the ease of sharing crisp, accurate documents across computer systems made the long-envisioned paperless office a reality.
Though Adobe is best known for the PDF, it owes its dominance in the software industry to a whole suite of design programs championed by Dr. Warnock over the years, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator.
Taken together, these programs helped make the modern personal computing experience what it is, turning what had been a soup of obscure commands and monochromatic images into an engaging aesthetic experience.
"Making the computer into a machine that we can use to produce visual and print culture, that wasn't foreordained," David Brock, the director of curatorial affairs at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., said in a phone interview. "That's where he was really instrumental."
John Edward Warnock was born on Oct. 6, 1940, in Holladay, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. His father, Clarence, was a lawyer; his mother, Dorothy (Van Dyke) Warnock, was a homemaker.
John was an admittedly average high school student who managed to flunk algebra in ninth grade. Nevertheless, he studied mathematics at the University of Utah, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1961 and a master's in the same subject in 1964.
He did not initially plan to go into technology. But a grueling summer job during graduate school spent recapping tires persuaded him to apply to IBM, which was recruiting mathematicians.
He returned to Utah to pursue a doctorate in mathematics, but after a few years he switched to electrical engineering, which at the time encompassed computer science. The university had recently received an enormous influx of money and resources from the Department of Defense to work on computer graphics, a field that had captured his interest.
He was especially captivated by the question of how to render a three-dimensional image in two dimensions. The result was the Warnock algorithm, a major step forward in computer graphics and the basis for some of his later work at Adobe.
He married Marva Mullins in 1965. She survives him, as do his daughter, Alyssa; his sons, Christopher and Jeffrey; and four grandchildren.
Dr. Warnock received his doctorate in 1969 and then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to work for a company founded by two of his mentors at Utah, David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland. After they asked him to transfer to the company's Salt Lake City office he decided to stay in California instead and went to work for Xerox, whose Palo Alto Research Center was then pioneering the first personal computers.
There he met Dr. Geschke, and the two became fast friends. Dr. Warnock spent years working on how to get printers to render an image from a computer screen, a seemingly easy issue that had befuddled computer scientists for years. (Dr. Geschke died in 2021).
But when he presented his solution, InterPress, to his bosses, they were not interested in releasing it to the public. He and Dr. Geschke, who had worked on the project, were crestfallen.
"I went into his office, and I said, 'We can live in the world's greatest sandbox for the rest of our life, or we can do something about it,"' Dr. Warnock said in a 2018 interview with the Computer History Museum.
They both quit, and in late 1982 they founded Adobe Systems, named for a creek near Dr. Warnock's home. In 2023 it had a market capitalization of $ 235 billion, making it one of the largest information-technology companies in the world.
In 2009, President Barack Obama presented the National Medal of Technology and Innovation to both Dr. Warnock and Dr. Geschke.
Dr. Warnock and Dr. Geschke, who ran the company as equals, were rare exceptions among the outsize egos and eccentric zillionaires of Silicon Valley: avuncular and academic, they built an aggressively competitive company while consistently ranking high on lists of the best places to work.
Despite its size, Adobe was often cast as the David versus much larger Goliaths, most often Microsoft -- which, unlike Apple, repeatedly rejected Dr. Warnock's entreaties to collaborate and instead tried to beat Adobe with its own protocols and programs. None of them worked.
Dr. Warnock, who had 20 patents to his name, stepped down as chief executive in 2001 but remained on Adobe's board of directors.
"Being a C.E.O. of a company that is over $ 1 billion is not all it is cracked up to be," he said in an interview with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2010. "The thing I really enjoy is the invention process. I enjoy figuring out how to do things other people don't know how to do."

Nvidia Revenue Doubles on Demand for A.I. Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales for the current quarter will nearly triple their total a year ago, said the company, which makes chips essential to the development of A.I. systems.
In a sign that the tech industry's next big boom is picking up steam, Nvidia on Wednesday predicted rapid growth in the already rabid demand for the chips it makes to build artificial intelligence systems.
The Silicon Valley company's products, called graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create the vast majority of A.I. systems, including the popular ChatGPT chatbot. Tech companies ranging from start-ups to the industry's giants are fighting to get their hands on them.
Nvidia said heavy demand from cloud computing services and other customers for chips to power A.I. systems caused revenue for its second quarter, which ended in July, to jump 101 percent from a year earlier, to $ 13.5 billion, while profit surged more than ninefold to nearly $ 6.2 billion.
That was even better than what Nvidia had projected in late May, when its $ 11 billion revenue estimate for the quarter stunned Wall Street and helped push Nvidia's market value above $ 1 trillion for the first time.
Nvidia's prediction and lofty market cap became a symbol for the growing exuberance surrounding A.I., which is transforming many computing systems and the way they are programmed. They also sharply raised the interest in what Nvidia might say the next time about chip demand for its current quarter, which ends in October.
Nvidia projected third-quarter sales of $ 16 billion, nearly triple the level a year ago and $ 3.7 billion more than analysts' average expectations of around $ 12.3 billion.
The financial performance of chip makers is often considered a harbinger for the rest of the tech industry, and Nvidia's strong results could reignite enthusiasm for tech stocks on Wall Street. Other tech companies like Google and Microsoft are spending billions and making little on A.I., but Nvidia is cashing in.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry. "The number of applications is just quite spectacular," he said in an interview after a conference call with analysts. "Every single data center will be accelerated."
Nvidia's share price was up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading.
Until recently, Nvidia got the biggest share of its revenue from sales of GPUs for rendering images in video games. But A.I. researchers started using those chips in 2012 for tasks such as machine learning, a trend that Nvidia exploited over the years by adding enhancements to its GPUs and many pieces of software to reduce labor for A.I. programmers.
Chip sales for data centers, where most A.I. training is accomplished, are now the company's biggest business. Revenue from that business grew 171 percent to $ 10.3 billion in the second period, Nvidia said.
Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the rush to add generative A.I. capability has become a fundamental imperative to corporate chiefs and boards of directors. Nvidia's only limitation at the moment, he said, is its struggle to supply enough chips -- a gap that may create opportunities for major chip companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and start-ups such as Groq.
Nvidia's roaring sales contrasted sharply with the fortunes of some of its chip industry peers, which have been hurt by soft demand for personal computers and data center servers used for general-purpose tasks. Intel said in late July that second-quarter revenue fell 15 percent, though the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Revenue at Advanced Micro Devices fell 18 percent in the same period.
Some analysts believe that spending on A.I.-specific hardware, such as Nvidia's chips and systems that use them, is drawing money away from spending on other data center infrastructure. IDC, a market research firm, estimates that cloud services will increase their spending on server systems for A.I. by 68 percent over the next five years.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
Demand is particularly heavy for the H100, a new GPU made by Nvidia for A.I. applications, which began shipping in September. Large and small companies have been scrambling to find supplies of the chips, which are fabricated in an advanced production process and require equally sophisticated packaging that combines GPUs with special memory chips.
Nvidia's ability to increase deliveries of the H100 is largely linked to actions by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which handles the packaging as well as fabricating the GPUs.
Industry executives expect the shortage of H100s to extend throughout 2024, a problem for A.I. start-ups and cloud services hoping to sell computing services that exploit the new GPUs.
Mr. Huang said the company was working diligently with its production partners to get more chips to market, including working with other companies to supplement TSMC's packaging capability. "Supply will substantially increase the rest of this year and next year," he said. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Working for New York City, New York State and the U.S. government, he made a career of preparing for the worst and then dealing with it, from 9/11 to hurricanes.
Jerome M. Hauer, who as the first director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management oversaw New York City's response to floods, manhole explosions, mold outbreaks, building collapses, water main breaks, blackouts, hurricanes, sink holes, downed trees, terrorist threats, vermin and the uncertain digital impact on computer networks of Y2K, the turn of the millennium, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 71.
The cause was prostate cancer, his wife, Traci L. Hauer, said.
Working under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani from 1996 to 2000, Mr. Hauer "won widespread cooperation" from other city agencies and from the state and federal governments, the urban historian Fred Siegel wrote in "The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York, and the Genius of American Life" (2005). He was "a big, plain-spoken and knowledgeable man," added Mr. Siegel, who died in May.
Mr. Hauer developed an early and comprehensive response to the threat of a bioterrorism attack and to the proliferation of the West Nile virus in the city, rallying relevant agencies to the cause. He later took what he had learned working for the city and applied it to emergency and risk management jobs for New York State and for the federal government, both during and after major crises -- including the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, the subsequent anthrax threat and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
"He was a unicorn, a truly singular individual, a man for crises in all seasons," William J. Bratton, who as New York's police commissioner worked with Mr. Hauer in city government, said in a phone interview.
As part of his job for the city, Mr. Hauer worked to integrate the Police and Fire Departments and other agencies, long at odds with one another, into a harmonic army of emergency medical workers.
"Hauer brought an energy to the role, molding a team of a dozen cops, E.M.T.s and firefighters into an elite group of crisis managers," said Joseph J. Lhota, who had been a deputy mayor under Mr. Giuliani.
But Mr. Hauer struggled mightily in trying to coordinate seamless emergency response efforts. He was often stymied by turf wars and other rivalries unresolved by City Hall.
On Sept. 11, 2001, for example, after he had left city government and was working for the federal government, many hand-held radios equipped for frequencies that would have allowed the police and firefighters to communicate with one another at the World Trade Center site had not been distributed.
Mr. Hauer had left his city office in February 2000, the year after he oversaw the opening of a $ 13 million emergency command center on the 23rd floor of 7 World Trade Center, which was hailed by many of his state and federal counterparts in emergency preparedness. But critics questioned why the center was sited across the street from a 1993 terrorist bombing in another Trade Center building. The command center was destroyed when the building collapsed, along with the Trade Center's North and South Towers, on Sept. 11.
In response to the criticism, Mr. Hauer later produced a memo from 1996 in which he had recommended a Downtown Brooklyn location as a "good alternative" for the command center. But that idea, he said, was overruled by the mayor, who wanted the center to be within walking distance of City Hall. Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Hauer had signed off on the ultimate decision.
Jerome Maurice Hauer was born on Oct. 31, 1951, at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan, where his mother, Rose (Muscatine) Hauer, was vice president for nursing and dean emerita of the Phillips Beth Israel School of Nursing. His father, Milton G. Hauer, was vice president of Williams & Company, a real estate firm.
Jerome Hauer earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from New York University in 1975 and a master's in emergency medical services from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health (now the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) in Baltimore. As a graduate student there, he developed a technique for returning blood to patients after cardiac and trauma surgery.
He was a captain in the Army Reserve Medical Services Corps and received a doctorate from Cranfield University's Defence Academy in Britain.
He was a deputy director of New York City's Emergency Medical Services from 1984 to 1986; managed an emergency response program for IBM; directed Indiana's Emergency Management Agency from 1989 to 1995; and, from 2001 to 2002, was senior adviser to the secretary for national security of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he dealt with the aftermath of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks.
As the first acting assistant secretary in the department's Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness from 2002 to 2004, Mr. Hauer was charged with coordinating the country's readiness for medical and public health emergencies -- including acts of biological, chemical and nuclear terrorism -- and its responses to them.
From 2011 to 2014, he was commissioner of the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services.
He was also a senior adviser at Teneo and chief executive of the Hauer Group, both consulting firms. He worked alongside Mr. Bratton at Teneo.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Michael, from his marriage to Glenda Reed, which ended in divorce; and a sister, Deborah Hauer Schwartz.
Mr. Hauer made it a point not to inure himself to disasters. At the sites of some catastrophes, he would sift through piles of rubble for a brick or other remnant, then bring it back to his office as a solemn reminder that his mission was to prepare for the worst in a world of what-ifs.

How Nvidia Became A.I.'s One-Stop Shop: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The most visible winner of the artificial intelligence boom achieved its dominance by becoming a one-stop shop for A.I. development, from chips to software to other services.
Naveen Rao, a neuroscientist turned tech entrepreneur, once tried to compete with Nvidia, the world's leading maker of chips tailored for artificial intelligence.
At a start-up that the semiconductor giant Intel later bought, Mr. Rao worked on chips intended to replace Nvidia's graphics processing units, which are components adapted for A.I. tasks like machine learning. But while Intel moved slowly, Nvidia swiftly upgraded its products with new A.I. features that countered what he was developing, Mr. Rao said.
After leaving Intel and leading a software start-up, MosaicML, Mr. Rao used Nvidia's chips and evaluated them against those from rivals. He found that Nvidia had differentiated itself beyond the chips by creating a large community of A.I. programmers who consistently invent using the company's technology.
"Everybody builds on Nvidia first," Mr. Rao said. "If you come out with a new piece of hardware, you're racing to catch up."
Over more than 10 years, Nvidia has built a nearly impregnable lead in producing chips that can perform complex A.I. tasks like image, facial and speech recognition, as well as generating text for chatbots like ChatGPT. The onetime industry upstart achieved that dominance by recognizing the A.I. trend early, tailoring its chips to those tasks and then developing key pieces of software that aid in A.I. development.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, has since kept raising the bar. To maintain its leading position, his company has also offered customers access to specialized computers, computing services and other tools of their emerging trade. That has turned Nvidia, for all intents and purposes, into a one-stop shop for A.I. development.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
In May, the company's status as the most visible winner of the A.I. revolution became clear when it projected a 64 percent leap in quarterly revenue, far more than Wall Street had expected. On Wednesday, Nvidia -- which has surged past $ 1 trillion in market capitalization to become the world's most valuable chip maker -- is expected to confirm those record results and provide more signals about booming A.I. demand.
"Customers will wait 18 months to buy an Nvidia system rather than buy an available, off-the-shelf chip from either a start-up or another competitor," said Daniel Newman, an analyst at Futurum Group. "It's incredible."
Mr. Huang, 60, who is known for a trademark black leather jacket, talked up A.I. for years before becoming one of the movement's best-known faces. He has publicly said computing is going through its biggest shift since IBM defined how most systems and software operate 60 years ago. Now, he said, GPUs and other special-purpose chips are replacing standard microprocessors, and A.I. chatbots are replacing complex software coding.
"The thing that we understood is that this is a reinvention of how computing is done," Mr. Huang said in an interview. "And we built everything from the ground up, from the processor all the way up to the end."
Mr. Huang helped start Nvidia in 1993 to make chips that render images in video games. While standard microprocessors excel at performing complex calculations sequentially, the company's GPUs do many simple tasks at once.
In 2006, Mr. Huang took that further. He announced software technology called CUDA, which helped program the GPUs for new tasks, turning them from single-purpose chips to more general-purpose ones that could take on other jobs in fields like physics and chemical simulations.
A big breakthrough came in 2012 when researchers used GPUs to achieve humanlike accuracy in tasks such as recognizing a cat in an image -- a precursor to recent developments like generating images from text prompts.
Nvidia responded by turning "every aspect of our company to advance this new field," Mr. Jensen recently said in a commencement speech at National Taiwan University.
The effort, which the company estimated has cost more than $ 30 billion over a decade, made Nvidia more than a component supplier. Besides collaborating with leading scientists and start-ups, the company built a team that directly participates in A.I. activities like creating and training language models.
Advance warning about what A.I. practitioners need led Nvidia to develop many layers of key software beyond CUDA. Those included hundreds of prebuilt pieces of code, called libraries, that save labor for programmers.
In hardware, Nvidia gained a reputation for consistently delivering faster chips every couple of years. In 2017, it started tweaking GPUs to handle specific A.I. calculations.
That same year, Nvidia, which typically sold chips or circuit boards for other companies' systems, also began selling complete computers to carry out A.I. tasks more efficiently. Some of its systems are now the size of supercomputers, which it assembles and operates using proprietary networking technology and thousands of GPUs. Such hardware may run weeks to train the latest A.I. models.
"This type of computing doesn't allow for you to just build a chip and customers use it," Mr. Huang said in the interview. "You've got to build the whole data center."
Last September, Nvidia announced the production of new chips named H100, which it enhanced to handle so-called transformer operations. Such calculations turned out to be the foundation for services like ChatGPT, which have prompted what Mr. Huang calls the "iPhone moment" of generative A.I.
To further extend its influence, Nvidia has also recently forged partnerships with big tech companies and invested in high-profile A.I. start-ups that use its chips. One was Inflection AI, which in June announced $ 1.3 billion in funding from Nvidia and others. The money was used to help finance the purchase of 22,000 H100 chips.
Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection's chief executive, said that there was no obligation to use Nvidia's products but that competitors offered no viable alternative. "None of them come close," he said.
Nvidia has also directed cash and scarce H100s lately to upstart cloud services, such as CoreWeave, that allow companies to rent time on computers rather than buying their own. CoreWeave, which will operate Inflection's hardware and owns more than 45,000 Nvidia chips, raised $ 2.3 billion in debt this month to help buy more.
Given the demand for its chips, Nvidia must decide who gets how many of them. That power makes some tech executives uneasy.
"It's really important that hardware doesn't become a bottleneck for A.I. or gatekeeper for A.I.," said Clément Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face, an online repository for language models that collaborates with Nvidia and its competitors.
Some rivals said it was tough to compete with a company that sold computers, software, cloud services and trained A.I. models, as well as processors.
"Unlike any other chip company, they have been willing to openly compete with their customers," said Andrew Feldman, chief executive of Cerebras, a start-up that develops A.I. chips.
But few customers are complaining, at least publicly. Even Google, which began creating competing A.I. chips more than a decade ago, relies on Nvidia's GPUs for some of its work.
Demand for Google's own chips is "tremendous," said Amin Vahdat, a Google vice president and general manager of compute infrastructure. But, he added, "we work really closely with Nvidia."
Nvidia doesn't discuss prices or chip allocation policies, but industry executives and analysts said each H100 costs $ 15,000 to more than $ 40,000, depending on packaging and other factors -- roughly two to three times more than the predecessor A100 chip.
Pricing "is one place where Nvidia has left a lot of room for other folks to compete," said David Brown, a vice president at Amazon's cloud unit, arguing that its own A.I. chips are a bargain compared with the Nvidia chips it also uses.
Mr. Huang said his chips' greater performance saved customers money. "If you can reduce the time of training to half on a $ 5 billion data center, the savings is more than the cost of all of the chips," he said. "We are the lowest-cost solution in the world."
He has also started promoting a new product, Grace Hopper, which combines GPUs with internally developed microprocessors, countering chips that rivals say use much less energy for running A.I. services.
Still, more competition seems inevitable. One of the most promising entrants in the race is a GPU sold by Advanced Micro Devices, said Mr. Rao, whose start-up was recently purchased by the data and A.I. company DataBricks.
"No matter how anybody wants to say it's all done, it's not all done," Lisa Su, AMD's chief executive, said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Senate majority leader helped deliver billions of dollars in federal funding for semiconductors. Now he's pushing for his state to reap benefits.
In a darkened hotel ballroom in San Jose, Calif., last November, the most powerful players in the semiconductor industry received a familiar sales pitch.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, appeared by video message to urge the industry titans at the Semiconductor Industry Association's annual awards dinner to work together to strengthen American manufacturing of a critical technology -- and to invest more in his home state, New York.
"I ask that more of the industry consider investing in the Empire State, and if you do, you'll find no greater champion in your corner than me, the Senate majority leader," Mr. Schumer said, to cheers and laughs of recognition from a crowd accustomed to the senator's solicitations.
Amid growing fears about China's dominance of technology and America's loss of competitiveness, Mr. Schumer helped rally Congress last year to push through the biggest industrial policy programs the United States had seen in a generation. The Biden administration is now preparing to invest tens of billions of dollars in the U.S. semiconductor industry in an effort to boost chip manufacturing across the country and lessen U.S. reliance on foreign factories.
If Mr. Schumer gets his way, a substantial part of that funding will flow to New York.
In his encounters with chip executives, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and President Biden himself, Mr. Schumer has openly and aggressively drawn on his political capital as majority leader to try to channel investment to his home state. During the months when Congress was debating whether to approve that funding, industry executives who set foot in Mr. Schumer's office or spoke to him on the flip phone he carries in his breast pocket were asked when, not if, they would invest in New York.
Mr. Schumer, a longtime China critic, primarily views the investments as critical to reducing America's reliance on Beijing for a technology that powers everything from cars and dishwashers to missiles and fighter jets. Most chip production has moved to Asia in recent decades, leaving the U.S. economy highly vulnerable to shortages, as became apparent during the pandemic.
But he also saw the opportunity to fulfill a more personal goal: securing investment that could revive the factory towns of his state, which had been hollowed out through decades of competition with China. The move would also augment his local political support, attract donations from chip companies to fill Democratic coffers and cement his legacy as a proponent of upstate New York.
"I cared about upstate, and I cared about competition with China," Mr. Schumer said in an interview in Albany in June. "When I drafted the legislation, I did things with New York companies in mind."
Senate majority leaders and other legislators have long used their clout to drive federal funds back home. But Mr. Schumer is capitalizing on his position at an opportune moment, as the United States prepares to invest nearly $ 53 billion in the sector, including $ 11 billion for chip research and $ 39 billion in manufacturing grants.
Still, some critics have cautioned that economic and strategic factors, not political influence, must determine the investment decisions that could shape the U.S. economy for decades to come.
If the proposed investments are realized, New York could become one of the country's busiest hubs for chip production. Chip makers like GlobalFoundries, IBM, Onsemi and Wolfspeed are applying for funds to build or expand facilities there. Micron Technology, a memory chip maker, is proposing to invest up to $ 100 billion near Syracuse over the next two decades to build what would be the largest high-tech chips facility proposed in the United States, employing up to 9,000 people.
Mr. Schumer is also pushing for New York to play a leading role in semiconductor research, as the headquarters of a new federal chip research organization.
Competition for federal funding is expected to be fierce. By late June, the Commerce Department -- which will dole out the funds -- had received nearly 400 statements of interest from companies that intended to apply for money.
"I suspect there will be many disappointed companies who feel that they should have a certain amount of money," Ms. Raimondo said in February.
New York has already faced some setbacks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Intel, makers of the most cutting-edge types of logic chips, passed over the state in recent years in favor of Arizona, Texas and Ohio, where they are now building large facilities that could absorb a significant portion of government funding.
Chip industry executives say practical factors, like the cost of electricity, land and capital, the availability of workers and the proximity of their suppliers, weigh heaviest in their decisions about where to invest.
But the pressure from Mr. Schumer -- and from other influential lawmakers, university presidents and company executives who helped secure the funding -- raises questions about the role powerful political figures will play in the next chapter of American industrial policy.
"I think there is and ought to be a lot of skepticism about political players having a major say in decision making over where these funds are spent," said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University and the author of "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology."
"If you want effective industrial policy, you have to keep it as far away as possible from pork barrel politics," he said.
The Commerce Department has been hiring experts in finance and semiconductors to review company applications, and it has set up a selection committee to choose the board for the new research center, called the National Semiconductor Technology Center. The department appears to be trying to avoid any undue influence or favoritism.
"Our awards will be entirely dependent upon the strength of applications and which projects will advance U.S. economic and national security interests," the Commerce Department said in a statement.
Mr. Schumer insists that New York will win federal dollars on its own merits, but he is also explicit about the benefit his position brings. In June, as he walked the sunlit halls of the Albany NanoTech Complex, a long-running chip research and educational facility, Mr. Schumer said he "did not close out a single discussion" with a semiconductor company without encouraging it to invest in New York.
New York has five main advantages, he told executives: Skilled workers, stemming from New York's history of manufacturing. Cheap and plentiful water. Cheap hydropower. Shovel-ready sites for companies to build on.
"And fifth, they had the majority leader," he said.
In a yellow-lit clean room behind Mr. Schumer, workers in white protective suits were tending to hundreds of millions of dollars of advanced machinery. On tracks overhead, mechanized metal pails whizzed by carrying silicon wafers, each roughly the size of a record, to and from the machines, where they would be imprinted with layers of intricate circuitry.
Mr. Schumer paused to peer over his reading glasses at a smooth, white box the size of a mobile home: an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, made by the Dutch firm ASML, arguably the most advanced piece of machinery ever developed.
Albany NanoTech is the only public research facility in the United States with such a machine. The facility is applying for federal funding to build a new clean room in an adjacent parking lot, and it hopes to become home to part of the government's new research center.
"This is the perfect place," Mr. Schumer said. "When we wrote the CHIPS and Science bill to set up a National Semiconductor Technology Center, I had Albany in mind. And I'm pushing to get it."
Mr. Schumer said he had personally made that case to a parade of administration officials he brought through the state. That included Mr. Biden, who was pitched on New York's potential as the two men rode in a motorcade to hear Micron's investment announcement last October.
By his telling, Mr. Schumer's efforts on behalf of upstate New York are a personal mission, stemming in part from an early challenge from a political opponent who told voters that they would never see Mr. Schumer, a Brooklyn native, west of the Hudson River. As he watched companies like General Motors, General Electric and Carrier shutter their New York facilities, he said, he vowed to do something to stop the flow of young people out of the state.
Mr. Schumer had also been one of Congress's earliest China hawks, particularly on the issue of Chinese currency manipulation. During a workout in 2019 in the Senate gym, he began forming a plan with Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, to bolster the U.S. economy by dedicating over $ 100 billion to technology research.
It took two years -- and an aggressive, coordinated lobbying effort between government and industry -- to amass the support and momentum to turn that bill into law. Mr. Schumer and other key Republican and Democratic lawmakers enlisted company executives, university presidents and state officials to talk publicly about the importance of the funding, and put pressure on reluctant members of Congress.
Mr. Schumer also worked closely with Ms. Raimondo to push the bill forward. He called her frequently as obstacles arose, including during Sunday Mass and her daughter's 18th birthday party, she said in an interview in July 2022.
As the bill progressed, the prospect of funding for new U.S. factories touched off an elaborate game of courtship among legislators, state officials and companies.
The number of chip lobbyists in Washington multiplied. Companies like GlobalFoundries and Intel, which stood to benefit enormously from the legislation, hosted or attended fund-raisers and virtual events for Mr. Schumer in the months before the CHIPS Act was passed. From the beginning of 2021 through June 2023, political action committees linked with Mr. Schumer received more than $ 350,000 in donations from executives at chip companies and their suppliers, including $ 5,000 from Intel's chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, data from the Federal Election Commission shows.
New York played host to a series of chip companies considering potential investments, particularly for the plot that Micron now plans to build on. TSMC looked at the site in 2019 before it chose Arizona, and Intel considered the same location but ultimately chose Ohio.
Micron was ready to write off New York because the state did not have a big enough site, Ryan McMahon, the local county executive, said. To win the final bid, the county spent tens of millions of dollars acquiring land, including buying out a street of homeowners, and running gas and electricity to the site, he said.
"If Schumer didn't introduce us, it's one of those things you wonder if it ever would have happened," Mr. McMahon, a Republican, said.
Mr. Schumer, along with other proponents, secured an investment tax credit in the chips legislation that Micron saw as key to making the economics of the project work. And at the urging of Gov. Kathy Hochul, state lawmakers passed their own chips subsidy bill to complement the federal one, approving up to $ 500 million a year in tax abatements to chip manufacturers.
Micron has said it plans to start construction next year and complete the first $ 20 billion phase of the factory by 2030. New York State has promised to give Micron $ 5.5 billion in tax credits over the life of the project if the company meets certain employment targets.
As the biggest maker of memory chips with headquarters in the United States, Micron is seen as a likely candidate for a federal grant. But other developments have thrown the project into question: Micron has recently become the subject of a crackdown in China that could cost the company an eighth of its global revenue, potentially undercutting its ability to make ambitious investments.
The deal has also been met with skepticism from local government watchdogs, who fear that Micron will become the latest firm to be offered taxpayer subsidies but fail to deliver the promised economic impact.
"It might be good geostrategic policy for the United States," said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a watchdog focused on the New York government. "But for New York, it's an incredibly low return on the investment of subsidy dollars."
For both Mr. Schumer and Governor Hochul, the Micron investment became a centerpiece of their electoral strategy last fall. With Republicans on their way to the best statewide showing in two decades, both Democrats packaged clips of themselves with Micron's chief executive into TV ads that blanketed parts of the state otherwise wary of Democrats' economic agenda.
"Transformational for upstate New York, transformational for America," Mr. Schumer said in one.

Full text: A moment of forgetfulness by a distracted or sleep-deprived parent can be devastating. Experts and child-safety advocates have called for interior motion sensors in all vehicles.
Ever since Tyler Cestia left his son Thomas in his truck on a hot morning in June two years ago, he has felt, he said, like a cork bobbing in the ocean.
It was June 14, 2021, and Mr. Cestia was preparing for a stressful audit at work when he forgot to drop off Thomas at the babysitter on the way to his office in New Iberia, La.
At lunchtime, he drove to a restaurant with the auditor and then back to his office.
That afternoon, it occurred to him that he didn't remember seeing the babysitter that morning. He ran to his truck where he found Thomas in his car seat behind the driver's seat. Thomas, who was 2 and a half years old, was pronounced dead at the scene.
"It was just a total utter shock," said Mr. Cestia, 37, who lives in New Iberia with his wife, Pam, and their two other children. "It's almost like a nightmare that's not real. I'm living in a makeshift world that's not real. And once you come down off that, it's a daily grind."
Mr. Cestia said he has coped with the extreme grief with help from his religious faith and therapy. He has also had the support of his wife.
"People think, 'Oh, how does somebody do that?"' Pam Cestia said. "You don't forget your cellphone. You don't forget this. But he was hyper-focused on something else. He's not a bad parent. He's not a bad father."
The aftermath in other cases has been more dire. Marriages have fallen apart. Caregivers have been prosecuted and faced prison time. In one case last year in Chesterfield, Va., a father who realized what he had done immediately went home and killed himself.
And still the deaths come. Just this week in Houston, a 3-month-old died after he was left unattended in a car, the police said. About 40 children a year die from heatstroke in cars, either because they are left in the vehicle or because they become trapped, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
That averages out to a child dying in a hot car every 10 days in the United States. The deaths are more frequent in summer but happen in every month of the year.
Child-safety advocates said that new technology could help prevent these recurring tragedies. Vehicles with interior motion sensors, for example, can sound the horn and send alerts to a driver's phone if they detect a child in the back seat after the car has been turned off.
But automakers and regulators have not made the technology standard equipment in new vehicles, frustrating safety experts. According to Kids and Car Safety, a nonprofit group, 1,050 children have died in hot cars nationwide since 1990 and at least another 7,300 have survived with varying injuries.
"It should really be embarrassing for the automakers and to the government that this has not already been taken care of," said Janette E. Fennell, the founder and president of Kids and Car Safety. "When you have the technology to prevent these deaths, and it's not expensive, what are we waiting for?"
Federal regulators said they were developing rules that would require new vehicles to have lights and chimes to remind drivers to check the back seat after they turn off a car, as required under the $ 1 trillion infrastructure law that President Biden signed in 2021. But that requirement won't take effect until 2025.
Major automakers have also pledged that by 2025 all new vehicles will include basic back-seat reminder systems. As of last October, more than 150 models offered the reminders, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which said in a statement that the industry was making "major progress" toward its goal of universal back-seat reminders.
But higher-tech systems that use radar or ultrasonic sensors to detect a child in the back seat remain relatively rare.
"It's a matter of cost and demand," said Emily A. Thomas, the manager of auto safety at Consumer Reports, which holds the position that child-detection systems should be standard in new vehicles. "People don't know this is what they need, so there's not a huge demand for it and, unfortunately, the auto industry responds to what's required. So if it's not required, they won't put it in as standard equipment."
About half of all hot-car deaths lead to criminal charges ranging from child endangerment to murder, according to Kids and Car Safety. Many parents and caregivers take plea deals to avoid jail time and because they are unwilling to face a court battle after the death of a child, the group said.
The psychological underpinnings of the problem have been discussed for years, at least since 2009, when Gene Weingarten of The Washington Post wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning article exploring whether criminal charges are really appropriate for parents who accidentally kill their children by leaving them in cars.
David M. Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who was quoted in that story, has been patiently explaining the issue ever since, including for a documentary film, "Fatal Distraction," that was released in 2021.
Dr. Diamond said that many of the deaths happen when parents drive to work and go into "autopilot mode and lose awareness of the child in the back seat."
During the drive, the part of the brain that handles habitual behaviors like commuting "outcompetes and suppresses" the conscious memory system, which is responsible for reminding a parent to stop and drop off the child at day care, Dr. Diamond said. Stressed and sleep-deprived parents are particularly susceptible to this problem, he said.
"That's why we need technology because, frankly, we are so forgetful," Dr. Diamond said in an interview. "I try to emphasize to people that it's not negligence, it's not bad parenting, it's just part of being human."
The reminder lights and chimes installed in many newer vehicles advise drivers to check the back seat when the car is turned off. Those systems are usually triggered by a rear door being opened before or during a trip, but they cannot actually detect whether a child is in the car.
Ultrasonic sensors, found in some Kia and Hyundai vehicles, can detect a child (or a pet) moving in the back seat after a vehicle has been locked and then blow the horn and send text messages to the driver. But ultrasonic sensors may not detect a child sleeping in a rear-facing car seat, Dr. Thomas said.
Radar-based systems can purportedly detect even slight movements like the rise and fall of the chest of a child sleeping in a car seat. At least one vehicle, the Genesis GV70, features that technology.
In March, the Federal Communications Commission approved a specific frequency for short-range radar, which automakers say will make it much easier to deploy child-detecting radar inside cars. Before that, companies had to seek waivers from the F.C.C.
While radar technology is not widely available, safety advocates said that drivers could remind themselves to check the back seat by putting something important next to the child, like a purse, phone, wallet or even one of their shoes.
The Cestias have their own system. Every morning at 8:05 they text each other to make sure that their 1½-year-old was dropped off at the babysitter.
They have also spoken out strongly in favor of mandatory child-detection technology in cars.
"This is my opportunity to be Thomas's mom and to advocate for him," Pam Cestia said. "His story can help save other people's lives."

Mortgage-Rate Envy? You're Not Alone.: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At a rooftop party on a steamy July night in Philadelphia, the margarita machine was churning, the seafood boil was hearty, and the conversation turned to the default of the upwardly mobile: real estate.
Almost anyone shopping for a home in the 2020s knows the script by now: Someone mentions their recent home purchase, a tale undoubtedly rich with drama, stress and suspense. Guests, well schooled in the volatility of the housing market, lean in for the follow-up: When did you buy?
The response to that key question "is normally followed by an 'Oooh,"' said Evan Barker, 36, a lawyer who attended the party and has participated in enough of these exchanges to know that the "Oooh" means one of two things: You either got the interest rate of a lifetime, or you squarely did not.
Fortunately for Mr. Barker, he falls into the former category. He and his wife, Laura Gallagher, 36, bought their first house in Bryn Mawr, Pa., in the early spring of 2020, weeks before home prices began their fastest ascent in U.S. history, as mortgage rates plummeted to historic lows. In January 2021, the 30-year mortgage rate bottomed out at 2.65 percent, a few months before Mr. Barker and Ms. Gallagher refinanced, besting the national average with a rate of 2.375 percent.
So it's no wonder that Mr. Barker spent the evening enjoying the banter almost as much as the stunning City Center rooftop views. He knew his lines for this dialogue. He had spent months fine-tuning his delivery, usually waiting for someone else to toss out an enviable interest rate before he topped it.
"I throw the humble brag in," he said. "Hey! Best financial decision of my life was pure luck. It's just that simple."
While most of the guests spent the conversation one-upping each other, the person who stood out to Mr. Barker was the one who had bought recently, at a substantially higher interest rate than everyone else. "They shocked us with some of their payment info," he said.
American homeowners now stand on two sides of a divide. On one side are those who had the good fortune to buy or refinance between 2020 and early 2022, and now enjoy notably low monthly interest payments on their principal. On the other side: everyone else.
These prospective and recent home buyers are watching their purchasing power diminish as home prices hold steady amid rising rates. In mid July, the 30-year mortgage rate hovered just under 7 percent, after reaching a high of 7.08 percent in October. The last time rates exceeded 7 percent was in 2002 -- more than 20 years ago.
The contrast creates ideal conditions for ribbing from the winners and resentment from the losers. Homeowners and buyers say the sparring has been happening among friends at parties, with colleagues at the office, and on social media, where it plays out as memes that are smug, shocked or hopeless, depending on where you fall on the spectrum.
"There is almost a cross-generational envy," said Övül Sezer, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Cornell University, who studies humble bragging.
Flaunting wealth and good fortune is nothing new. But Americans, for the most part, avoid sharing specifics about money. Sure, you'll plaster news about your promotion on Facebook and on the platform formerly known as Twitter, but you'll probably keep mum about the salary package that comes with it. When it comes to real estate, the attitude is no different. A gleeful homeowner may gloat about vanquishing the competition in a bidding war, but they won't mention the sale price, or their monthly payments.
In comes the interest rate, serving as the ideal proxy. Share your mortgage rate and you can showcase your financial prowess without revealing how much money you spent (or how much you have). It almost feels humble. Almost.
"When we brag, we signal our competence," Dr. Sezer said -- telling the world, in this case, that we're savvy consumers. "Yet we also know that bragging is kind of bad, so humble bragging is this seemingly sweet spot. It allows us to both brag, but also look humble."
Few people are fooled.
"It's like a talking point. We get it, we know, yes, yes -- everybody has 2.6 percent, you're all so smart, thanks for informing me," said Ike Wachuku, 34, a software engineer in Baltimore, who will not be getting a 2.6 percent interest rate if he and his wife ever manage to find a new house. "People are rubbing your face in it."
Consumers have little control over what mortgage rate they get, aside from maintaining a solid credit rating. Mortgage rates have been rising in response to the Federal Reserve's continued efforts to wrestle inflation under control. So timing, not skill, dictates the rate -- and timing is a byproduct of luck.
As it happens, luck isn't entirely random. The pandemic exacerbated inequalities that existed before 2020. For many wealthier Americans, the pandemic was a financial boon. They kept their jobs, were able to work remotely, enjoyed bonuses and raises, and had cash on hand when interest rates plummeted to keep the economy afloat. They were the ones best positioned to pluck up homes, driving up prices. The people who spent 2020 and 2021 struggling through job losses, illnesses or other financial hardships likely missed out on the moment, and are now the ones enduring the hard consequences of rampant inflation.
The interest rate cut "was this free handout to people who didn't really need it," said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin. For everyone else, "that door closed as soon as people started to get back on their feet."
Or as Sharon Reshef, who last month bought a $ 400,000 one-bedroom apartment in Washington D.C., put it: "It's really hard to plan your life around macroeconomics."
That hasn't stopped some of her slightly older colleagues in Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's office from teasing her about her 6.625 percent interest rate.
"It's just a gentle ribbing," said Ms. Reshef, 30, the research director for the senator from New York, who now spends half of her take-home pay on her mortgage. "But as long as we're here, I will say that not a lot of people in my cohort own property, especially as a single person. Regardless of the interest rate, I have that one up on them. I can definitely brag."
In hindsight, Scott Decker, 35, wishes he had been ready to leave Brooklyn for the suburbs in 2021, when many of his friends were leaving. Instead, he and his wife, Maureen Decker, bought a home in Montclair, N.J., the following year. Now, when he drives his son to preschool, passing the stately homes on picturesque, tree-lined streets, he plays a tortured game.
"I'm like, 'I wonder what this house sold for?' And, 'We could have gotten this house two years ago if we had wanted it,"' he said. "I'm definitely always thinking about that and always a little jealous."
Mr. Decker, who leads strategic media planning for a tech company, "definitely overpaid" for the four-bedroom house that he and Ms. Decker bought for $ 1.1 million, 40 percent over the list price. They also took out an adjustable-rate mortgage, with a rate that is fixed at 4.15 percent until 2030, when it adjusts based on the current rates. "I'm terrified at what I may be forced to change to in the future," he said.
The Deckers are friendly with another Montclair couple who own a bigger house, but because their interest rate is lower, their monthly payments are about the same. "Every time we go to their house, I'm like, 'Man, this is unfair,"' Mr. Decker said.
Talk to anyone who managed to buy a home in 2020 or 2021, and they will probably tell you the competition was fierce and the experience miserable. But buyers today face similar, if not tougher, conditions. Inventory is anemic, partly because homeowners do not want to part with their low interest rates. So far, a scant 1 percent of American homes have traded hands this year, the lowest rate in a decade, according to a July report from Redfin.
Of course, things could be worse. In 1981, mortgage rates peaked at a jaw-dropping 18.53 percent. Still, the average home price in the second quarter of 1981 was $ 84,300 -- even adjusted for inflation, that's about $ 287,020, which is far less than the average price of $ 495,100 in the second quarter of 2023.
But people who remember the days of double-digit interest rates are often quick to remind younger generations that they, too, walked to school uphill both ways in the snow.
"The fate, the gods, determine when you enter that phase of your life and what is happening in the market," said Allen J. Palmer, 85, who is retired from IBM and bought his house in what is now Silicon Valley, in California, in 1977 for $ 95,000 (or $ 480,686 in today's dollars), with an 8.5 percent mortgage interest rate. The first year he and his wife spent in that house, they couldn't afford to fly home to Milwaukee for the holidays.
Young buyers "don't understand that this is the way it is," he said. "They probably don't remember that their parents struggled to pay" the mortgage, too.
On a recent TikTok video, Barbara Corcoran, the 74-year-old real estate mogul, arranged fresh flowers as she chided hesitant buyers for their reluctance to get back into the market -- a common refrain among real estate agents, who insist that there is no time like the present to buy a house.
"Pick your poison: high interest rates now, which aren't so high, or super-high prices once they come down," Ms. Corcoran said, her hand grazing a fern frond. "Your choice."
Mr. Decker, in Montclair, knows which choice he thinks buyers should make. Recently, he was standing at the bar of a local barbecue restaurant and overheard another patron who seemed overconfident about a recent lowball offer he had made on a house in town. Mr. Decker had lost enough bidding wars to know how this story would end, and considered schooling him on his grim prospects. Maybe he would lean across the bar, he thought, and say, "Don't even bother, man, cool your heels somewhere else." But he hesitated.
"It did make me feel a little good," he said, "and certainly thankful that I have a place to live and I'm not dealing with that right now."
Instead of offering unsolicited advice, he ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a shot of Jameson, and walked back to the patio to sit down and enjoy the evening with his family in their new town.

Full text: To many people, chatbots and other technology feel like a ticking time bomb, sure to explode their work. But to some, the threat is already here.
"This A.I. stuff is getting really crazy."
The voices of Charlamagne tha God, host of the nationally syndicated radio show "The Breakfast Club," and his guests Mandii B and WeezyWTF filled Ylonda Sherrod's car as she sped down Interstate 10 in Mississippi during her daily commute. Her favorite radio show was discussing artificial intelligence, specifically an A.I.-generated sample of Biggie.
"Sonically, it sounds cool," Charlamagne tha God said. "But it lacks soul."
WeezyWTF replied: "I've had people ask me like, 'Oh, would you replace people that work for you with A.I.?' I'm like, 'No, dude."'
Ms. Sherrod nodded along emphatically, as she drove past low-slung brick homes and strip malls dotted with Waffle Houses. She arrived at the AT&T call center where she works, feeling unsettled. She played the radio exchange about A.I. for a colleague.
"Yeah, that's crazy," Ms. Sherrod's friend replied. "What do you think about us?"
Like so many millions of American workers, across so many thousands of workplaces, the roughly 230 customer service representatives at AT&T's call center in Ocean Springs, Miss., watched artificial intelligence arrive over the past year both rapidly and assuredly, like a new manager settling in and kicking up its feet.
Suddenly, the customer service workers weren't taking their own notes during calls with customers. Instead, an A.I. tool generated a transcript, which their managers could later consult. A.I. technology was providing suggestions of what to tell customers. Customers were also spending time on phone lines with automated systems, which solved simple questions and passed on the complicated ones to human representatives.
Ms. Sherrod, 38, who exudes quiet confidence at 5-foot-11, regarded the new technology with a combination of irritation and fear. "I always had a question in the back of my mind," she said. "Am I training my replacement?"
Ms. Sherrod, a vice president of the call center's local union chapter, part of the Communications Workers of America, started asking AT&T managers questions. "If we don't talk about this, it could jeopardize my family," she said. "Will I be jobless?"
In recent months, the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT has made its way into courtrooms, classrooms, hospitals and everywhere in between. With it has come speculation about A.I.'s impact on jobs. To many people, A.I. feels like a ticking time bomb, sure to explode their work. But to some, like Ms. Sherrod, the threat of A.I. isn't abstract. They can already feel its effects.
When automation swallows up jobs, it often comes for customer service roles first, which make up about three million jobs in America. Automation tends to overtake tasks that repeat themselves; customer service, already a major site for outsourcing of jobs abroad, can be a prime candidate.
A majority of U.S. call center workers surveyed this year reported that their employers were automating some of their work, according to a 2,000-person survey from researchers at Cornell. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they felt it was somewhat or very likely that increased use of bots would lead to layoffs within the next two years.
Technology executives point out that fears of automation are centuries old -- stretching back to the Luddites, who smashed and burned textile machines -- but have historically been undercut by a reality in which automation creates more jobs than it eliminates.
But that job creation happens gradually. The new jobs that technology creates, like engineering roles, often demand complex skills. That can create a gap for workers like Ms. Sherrod, who found what seemed like a golden ticket at AT&T: a job that pays $ 21.87 an hour and up to $ 3,000 in commissions a month, she said, and provides health care and five weeks of vacation -- all without the requirement of a college degree. (Less than 5 percent of AT&T's roles require a college education.)
Customer service, to Ms. Sherrod, meant that someone like her -- a young Black woman raised by her grandmother in small-town Mississippi -- could make "a really good living."
"We're breaking generational curses," Ms. Sherrod said. "That's for sure."
In Ms. Sherrod's childhood home, a one-story, brick A-frame in Pascagoula, money was tight. Her mother died when she was 5. Her grandmother, who took her in, didn't work, but Ms. Sherrod remembers getting food stamps to take to the corner bakery whenever the family could spare them. Ms. Sherrod cries recalling how Christmas used to be. The family had a plastic tree and tried to make it festive with ornaments, but there was typically no money for presents.
To students at Pascagoula High School, she recalled, job opportunities seemed limited. Many went to Ingalls Shipbuilding, a shipyard where work meant blistering days under the Mississippi sun. Others went to the local Chevron refinery.
"It felt like I was going to always have to do hard labor in order to make a living," Ms. Sherrod said. "It seemed like my lifestyle would never be something with ease, something I enjoyed."
When Ms. Sherrod was 16, she worked at KFC, making $ 6.50 an hour. After graduating from high school, and dropping out of community college, she moved to Biloxi, Miss., to work as a maid at IP Casino, a 32-story hotel, where her sister still works.
Within months of working at the casino, Ms. Sherrod felt the toll of the job on her body. Her knees ached, and her back thrummed with pain. She had to clean at least 16 rooms a day, fishing hair out of bathroom drains and rolling up dirty sheets.
When a friend told her about the jobs at AT&T, the opportunity seemed, to Ms. Sherrod, impossibly good. The call center was air-conditioned. She could sit all day and rest her knees. She took the call center's application test twice, and on her second time she got an offer, in 2006, starting out making $ 9.41 an hour, up from around $ 7.75 at the casino.
"That $ 9 meant so much to me," she recalled.
So did AT&T, a place where she kept growing more comfortable: "Out of 17 years, my check hasn't ever been wrong," she said. "AT&T, by far, is the best job in the area."
'Your Biggest Nightmare'
This spring, lawmakers in Washington hauled forward the makers of A.I. tools to begin discussing the risks posed by the products they've unleashed.
"Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is," Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked OpenAI's chief executive, Sam Altman, after sharing that his own greatest fear was job loss.
"There will be an impact on jobs," said Mr. Altman, whose company developed ChatGPT.
That reality has already become clear. The British telecommunications company BT Group announced in May that it would cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030 as it increasingly relied on A.I. The chief executive of IBM said A.I. would affect certain clerical jobs in the company, eliminating the need for up to 30 percent of some roles, while creating new ones.
AT&T has begun integrating A.I. into many parts of its customer service work, including routing customers to agents, offering suggestions for technical solutions during customer calls and producing transcripts.
The company said all of these uses were intended to create a better experience for customers and workers. "We're really trying to focus on using A.I. to augment and assist our employees," said Nicole Rafferty, who leads AT&T's customer care operation and works with staff members nationwide.
"We're always going to need in-person engagement to solve those complex customer situations," Ms. Rafferty added. "That's why we're so focused on building A.I. that supports our employees."
Economists studying A.I. have argued that it most likely won't prompt sudden widespread layoffs. Instead, it could gradually eliminate the need for humans to do certain tasks -- and make the remaining work more challenging.
"The tasks left to call center workers are the most complex ones, and customers are frustrated," said Virginia Doellgast, a professor at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell.
Ms. Sherrod has always enjoyed getting to know her customers. She said she took about 20 calls a day, from 9:30 to 6:30. While she's resolving technical issues, she listens to why people are calling in, and she hears from customers who just bought new homes, were married or lost family members.
"It's sort of like you're a therapist," she said. "They tell you their life stories."
She is already finding her job growing more challenging with A.I. The automated technology has a hard time understanding Ms. Sherrod's drawl, she said, so the transcripts from her calls are full of mistakes. Once the technology is no longer in a pilot phase, she won't be able to make corrections. (AT&T said it was refining the A.I. products it used to prevent these kinds of errors.)
It seems likely, to Ms. Sherrod, that at some point as the work gets more efficient, the company won't need quite as many humans answering calls in its centers.
Ms. Sherrod wonders, too: Doesn't the company trust her? For two consecutive years, she won AT&T's Summit Award, placing her in the top 3 percent of the company's customer service representatives nationally. Her name was projected on the call center's wall.
"They gave everyone a little gift bag with a trophy," Ms. Sherrod recalled. "That meant a lot to me."
'Look at My Life'
As companies like AT&T embrace A.I., experts are floating proposals meant to protect workers. There's the possibility of training programs helping people make the transition to new jobs, or a displacement tax levied on employers when a worker's job is automated but the person is not retrained.
Labor unions are wading into these battles. In Hollywood, the unions representing actors and television writers have fought to limit the use of A.I. in script writing and production.
Just 6 percent of the country's private-sector workers are represented by unions. Ms. Sherrod is one, and she has begun fighting her company for more information about its A.I. plans, sitting in her union hall nine miles from the call center, where she works under a Norman Rockwell painting of a wireline technician.
For years, Ms. Sherrod's demands on behalf of the union have been rote. As a steward, she typically asked the company to reduce penalties for colleagues who got in trouble.
But for the first time, this summer, she feels that she is taking up an issue that will affect workers beyond AT&T. She recently asked her union to establish a task force focused on A.I.
In late May, Ms. Sherrod was invited by the Communications Workers of America to travel to Washington, where she and dozens of other workers met with the White House's Office of Public Engagement to share their experience with A.I.
A warehouse worker described being monitored with A.I. that tracked how speedily he moved packages, creating pressure for him to skip breaks. A delivery driver said automated surveillance technologies were being used to monitor workers and look for potential disciplinary actions, even though their records weren't reliable. Ms. Sherrod described how the A.I. in her call center created inaccurate summaries of her work.
Her son, Malik, was astonished to hear that his mother was headed to the White House. "When my dad told me about it, at first I said, 'You're lying,"' he said with a laugh.
Ms. Sherrod sometimes feels that her life presents an argument for a type of job that one day might no longer exist.
With her pay and commissions, she has been able to buy a home. She lives on a sunny street full of families, some of whom work in fields like nursing and accounting. She is down the road from a softball field and playground. On the weekends, her neighbors gather for cookouts. The adults eat snowballs, while the children play basketball and set up splash pads.
Ms. Sherrod takes pride in buying Malik anything he asks for. She wants to give him the childhood she never had.
"Call center work -- it's life-changing," she said. "Look at my life. Will all that be taken away from me?"

Full text: Out on the road with nowhere to plug in -- that's the greatest fear of many would-be electric vehicle buyers and why they're staying on the sidelines. And that's why a group of automakers is planning to build 30,000 fast charging points in North America.
The joint venture by seven carmakers -- BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis -- would nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States. Those chargers can replenish a drained battery in 10 to 30 minutes.
While most E.V. owners typically charge their vehicles at home overnight, they need fast charging stations for longer trips. But the chargers can be far-flung in sparsely populated areas.
At the moment, Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States. Last month, Ford Motor and G.M. struck a deal that would allow them to adopt Tesla's charging technology, and separately Tesla has pledged to make more of its chargers available to other car brands. The collaboration announced on Wednesday would give the automakers an option other than Tesla for charging.
Installing so many charging stations will be costly -- $ 1 billion -- and will take until the end of the decade to complete, though some chargers will be in place around the middle of next year.
But major carmakers have already invested billions to produce electric vehicles and want to ensure that the vehicles catch on. Shoring up charging infrastructure may be a necessary to getting car buyers over a major psychological hurdle.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," said Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M.
"We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold."
Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, on whether the central bank plans to continue raising interest rates after its latest increase on Wednesday.

Full text: Before meeting Jennifer Ziegler, Rebecca Woodfork said she was always "looking down and getting through life." One month together in Boston and a trip to St. Lucia changed that.
Rebecca Ann Woodfork and Jennifer Kathryn Ziegler had been talking on the phone daily for about six weeks when Ms. Ziegler, who lived in New York City, suggested she visit Ms. Woodfork in Boston for her 40th birthday.
Ms. Ziegler booked an Airbnb apartment for a weekend in March 2021. But Ms. Woodfork had a feeling she would be visiting longer.
"She told me, 'I'd pack enough for four weeks,"' Ms. Ziegler said.
Not long before that, Ms. Woodfork's therapist had told her to write down the most important qualities she wanted in a wife. Generosity and kindness topped the list, as did a pride and confidence in being gay. After she and Ms. Ziegler began talking, Ms. Woodfork quickly realized that Ms. Ziegler, with whom she had matched on Tinder in February 2021, was "everything I ever wanted," she said.
When they met in person for the first time on March 20, Ms. Woodfork realized the depths of her feelings immediately. "I could have married her right there," she said.
They ordered sushi and spent the evening in conversation. "We barely ate anything," Ms. Ziegler said. "She was really easy to talk to. She was interesting, funny, super positive."
At the time, Ms. Woodfork, 42, was working as the head of the hair department on the set of "The Tender Bar," a film directed by George Clooney. She had moved to Boston from Swampscott, Mass., after high school to study at the Learning Institute of Beauty Sciences, which is now closed. In recent years, she has worked on hair for films like "Shooting Stars," "Knives Out" and "Judas and the Black Messiah."
Ms. Ziegler, 50, grew up in Tallmadge, Ohio, and is a technology sales manager for IBM. She has a bachelor's degree in business from Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, and an M.B.A. from the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College in New York.
In the end, Ms. Woodfork's prediction came true: Once her Airbnb ended, Ms. Ziegler remained in Boston -- in Ms. Wordfork's apartment to be exact -- for a month.
The pandemic had made both women realize they were comfortable by themselves, but wanted to find their person. "Everybody's baking bread together, and I was baking alone," Ms. Woodfork said.
Ms. Ziegler had decided to use the slowdown brought on by the pandemic to put more effort into dating. "A lesbian isn't just going to fall from the sky," she said.
They spent their month in Boston cultivating a bond during evenings and weekends together. Ms. Woodfork was impressed by how wholeheartedly Ms. Ziegler supported her through a personal struggle.
In May 2020, the stitches Ms. Woodfork had from a previous surgery started popping out. She had a cyst removed from her cheek in 2018. It turned out she was allergic to the sutures.
"It looked like I had skinned my face," Ms. Woodfork said. When she met Ms. Ziegler, Ms. Woodfork was still physically and mentally in the healing process. She said that working in a beauty-focused industry made it difficult for her to accept the scar that ran down part of her face, and she was working through insecurities around her appearance. She worried about how Ms. Ziegler would respond, but it turned out, she need not have.
"I was so surprised that someone was so prepared to love me so much during that process," she said.
In May 2021, Ms. Woodfork and Ms. Ziegler went on vacation for 10 days in St. Lucia. "We really just enjoyed listening to Ella Fitzgerald and being in the pool all day and cooking together," Ms. Woodfork said. "That's where we fell in love."
After the trip, Ms. Woodfork flew to New York with Ms. Ziegler. The couple, who are mixed race, were pleasantly surprised by the reactions they received in the streets of the city. "People would come up to us to say, 'You guys are beautiful,"' Ms. Woodfork said. "I felt like we were leading by example."
In New York, she prepared to leave for Atlanta for at least six months to work on a film. For nearly a decade, Ms. Woodfork had been methodically building her career in film and TV, jumping from one set and one city to another, where she would work 80 to 90 hours per week.
"Finding time for another person wasn't something I even thought about," she said.
But the trip to St. Lucia -- her first vacation in years -- made her realize that she needed a break from her profession so she could focus on her personal life. She backed out of the job, and spent the summer with Ms. Ziegler in Provincetown, Mass. "Early in the relationship you need water and sunlight," she said. "It was the best decision I made. I don't know if we would be here otherwise."
In early fall 2022, Ms. Woodfork and Ms. Ziegler decided they wanted to get married, so they designed their engagement rings: platinum with diamonds. Afterward, Ms. Woodfork took the rings and said to Ms. Ziegler, "You won't know when or how, but we'll get engaged."

On Dec. 11, Ms. Woodfork brought Ms. Ziegler to Central Park.
As they walked toward Bethesda Fountain, Ms. Ziegler heard "The Good Life" by Robin Thicke, one of the songs Ms. Woodfork had shared with her early on in their relationship, when they were getting to know each other. She saw dozens of people looking at something and wondered what was happening. Ms. Woodfork pushed her along.
Then, Ms. Ziegler said, "I saw an arch of flowers, petals on the floor." An event-planning team had arranged easels holding photos of the couple, as well as posters with lines from a poem Ms. Woodfork had written. "I started crying as I was seeing all the pictures and reading everything," Ms. Ziegler said. "When we got through to the end, she got on one knee and proposed."
Afterward, they celebrated with brunch at Robert, a restaurant in the Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle that looks out onto New York City.
"She loves views and skylines," Ms. Woodfork said. "I was an ostrich before, looking down and getting through life. Views are something Jen brought back for me."
Ms. Ziegler and Ms. Woodfork, who now live in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, were legally married June 15 by Madeline Plasencia, a clerical associate at the New York City Clerk's Office. One month later, on July 15, they had a ceremony led by Libby Clark, Ms. Ziegler's best friend, and a celebration for 120 guests at the Lake Forest Country Club in Hudson, Ohio, not far from where Ms. Ziegler grew up. Ms. Woodfork first visited Ohio some years earlier, when she worked on "Judas and the Black Messiah." She fell in love with it.
Celebrating at the country club "was almost like being in someone's house," Ms. Woodfork said. "A very large, beautiful house."
The homey atmosphere was underscored by an eight-foot-long table that held 2,500 sweet treats prepared by Ms. Ziegler's family and friends. Ms. Ziegler's mother, Santina Pugliese Ziegler, who was born in the Calabria region of Italy, baked 1,500 of them over the course of three months, a combination of pizzelle, brownies, cannoli, amaretti and more. The brides made little bags filled with the desserts for guests to take home.
Ms. Ziegler wore a dress with an open back and a train, along with a veil with tiny pearls embroidered on it, and Ms. Woodfork wore a jumpsuit with two long tails in the back. "We felt beautiful," Ms. Ziegler said.
Ms. Woodfork described the wedding as a "melting pot." "We had my friends who are Black, her Italian family, our friends who are gay," she said.
Ms. Woodfork and Ms. Ziegler spent months working with an instructor on their choreographed first dance, which was a waltz with box steps, spins, dips and even a lift mixed in, set to the song "First Time" by Teeks. Once guests hit the dance floor, they partied to a smorgasbord of music genres that included songs from Prince, Sister Sledge, Beyoncé, TLC, Phil Collins and Stevie Wonder. "It was like an '80s or '90s prom," Ms. Woodfork said.
On This Day
When July 15, 2023
Where Lake Forest Country Club, Hudson, Ohio
V.I.P. Clients Ms. Woodfork styled both Ms. Ziegler's and Ms. Ziegler's mother's hair, an uncommon practice for a bride at her own wedding. Ms. Woodfork's friend Ashunta Sheriff, a professional makeup artist, did Ms. Woodfork's and Ms. Ziegler's makeup. "I felt like I should be on the cover of Essence," Ms. Woodfork said. "She really worked her magic."
Tarantella All the guests participated in an Italian folk dance called tarantella, where "people form a big circle, with lots of clapping and leg kicks," Ms. Ziegler said. "Even if you don't know it, everyone joins in and gets into it." At one point, Ms. Woodfork danced in the center of the circle. "She was a star," Ms. Ziegler said.
Something Blue Ms. Woodfork's maid-of-honor, Tia Gonzales, gifted the couple cloth napkins with the date of the wedding and their names embroidered on top. Unbeknown to Ms. Gonzales, the napkins had a scalloped-edge trim that looked exactly like the trim on the napkins that Ms. Ziegler's parents received at their wedding in 1966. "It was wild," Ms. Ziegler said.

With the Aid of A.I., Google's Robots Get Smart: [National Desk]

Full text: Our sneak peek into Google's new robotics model, RT-2, which melds artificial intelligence technology with robots.
A one-armed robot stood in front of a table. On the table sat three plastic figurines: a lion, a whale and a dinosaur.
An engineer gave the robot an instruction: "Pick up the extinct animal."
The robot whirred for a moment, then its arm extended and its claw opened and descended. It grabbed the dinosaur.
Until very recently, this demonstration, which I witnessed during a podcast interview at Google's robotics division in Mountain View, Calif., last week, would have been impossible. Robots weren't able to reliably manipulate objects they had never seen before, and they certainly weren't capable of making the logical leap from "extinct animal" to "plastic dinosaur."
But a quiet revolution is underway in robotics, one that piggybacks on recent advances in so-called large language models -- the same type of artificial intelligence system that powers ChatGPT, Bard and other chatbots.
Google has recently begun plugging state-of-the-art language models into its robots, giving them the equivalent of artificial brains. The secretive project has made the robots far smarter and given them new powers of understanding and problem-solving.
I got a glimpse of that progress during a private demonstration of Google's latest robotics model, called RT-2. The model, which is being unveiled on Friday, amounts to a first step toward what Google executives described as a major leap in the way robots are built and programmed.
"We've had to reconsider our entire research program as a result of this change," said Vincent Vanhoucke, Google DeepMind's head of robotics. "A lot of the things that we were working on before have been entirely invalidated."
Robots still fall short of human-level dexterity and fail at some basic tasks, but Google's use of A.I. language models to give robots new skills of reasoning and improvisation represents a promising breakthrough, said Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"What's very impressive is how it links semantics with robots," he said. "That's very exciting for robotics."
To understand the magnitude of this, it helps to know a little about how robots have conventionally been built.
For years, the way engineers at Google and other companies trained robots to do a mechanical task -- flipping a burger, for example -- was by programming them with a specific list of instructions. (Lower the spatula 6.5 inches, slide it forward until it encounters resistance, raise it 4.2 inches, rotate it 180 degrees, and so on.) Robots would then practice the task again and again, with engineers tweaking the instructions each time until they got it right.
This approach worked for certain, limited uses. But training robots this way is slow and labor-intensive. It requires collecting lots of data from real-world tests. And if you wanted to teach a robot to do something new -- to flip a pancake instead of a burger, say -- you usually had to reprogram it from scratch.
Partly because of these limitations, hardware robots have improved less quickly than their software-based siblings. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, disbanded its robotics team in 2021, citing slow progress and a lack of high-quality training data. In 2017, Google's parent company, Alphabet, sold Boston Dynamics, a robotics company it had acquired, to the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. (Boston Dynamics is now owned by Hyundai and seems to exist mainly to produce viral videos of humanoid robots performing terrifying feats of agility.)
In recent years, researchers at Google had an idea. What if, instead of being programmed for specific tasks one by one, robots could use an A.I. language model -- one that had been trained on vast swaths of internet text -- to learn new skills for themselves?
"We started playing with these language models around two years ago, and then we realized that they have a lot of knowledge in them," said Karol Hausman, a Google research scientist. "So we started connecting them to robots."
Google's first attempt to join language models and physical robots was a research project called PaLM-SayCan, which was revealed last year. It drew some attention, but its usefulness was limited. The robots lacked the ability to interpret images -- a crucial skill, if you want them to be able to navigate the world. They could write out step-by-step instructions for different tasks, but they couldn't turn those steps into actions.
Google's new robotics model, RT-2, can do just that. It's what the company calls a "vision-language-action" model, or an A.I. system that has the ability not just to see and analyze the world around it, but to tell a robot how to move.
It does so by translating the robot's movements into a series of numbers -- a process called tokenizing -- and incorporating those tokens into the same training data as the language model. Eventually, just as ChatGPT or Bard learns to guess what words should come next in a poem or a history essay, RT-2 can learn to guess how a robot's arm should move to pick up a ball or throw an empty soda can into the recycling bin.
"In other words, this model can learn to speak robot," Mr. Hausman said.
In an hourlong demonstration, which took place in a Google office kitchen littered with objects from a dollar store, my podcast co-host and I saw RT-2 perform a number of impressive tasks. One was successfully following complex instructions like "move the Volkswagen to the German flag," which RT-2 did by finding and snagging a model VW Bus and setting it down on a miniature German flag several feet away.
It also proved capable of following instructions in languages other than English, and even making abstract connections between related concepts. Once, when I wanted RT-2 to pick up a soccer ball, I instructed it to "pick up Lionel Messi." RT-2 got it right on the first try.
The robot wasn't perfect. It incorrectly identified the flavor of a can of LaCroix placed on the table in front of it. (The can was lemon; RT-2 guessed orange.) Another time, when it was asked what kind of fruit was on a table, the robot simply answered, "White." (It was a banana.) A Google spokeswoman said the robot had used a cached answer to a previous tester's question because its Wi-Fi had briefly gone out.
Google has no immediate plans to sell RT-2 robots or release them more widely, but its researchers believe these new language-equipped machines will eventually be useful for more than just parlor tricks. Robots with built-in language models could be put into warehouses, used in medicine or even deployed as household assistants -- folding laundry, unloading the dishwasher, picking up around the house, they said.
"This really opens up using robots in environments where people are," Mr. Vanhoucke said. "In office environments, in home environments, in all the places where there are a lot of physical tasks that need to be done."
Of course, moving objects around in the messy, chaotic physical world is harder than doing it in a controlled lab. And given that A.I. language models frequently make mistakes or invent nonsensical answers -- which researchers call hallucination or confabulation -- using them as the brains of robots could introduce new risks.
But Mr. Goldberg, the Berkeley robotics professor, said those risks were still remote.
"We're not talking about letting these things run loose," he said. "In these lab environments, they're just trying to push some objects around on a table."
Google, for its part, said RT-2 was equipped with plenty of safety features. In addition to a big red button on the back of every robot -- which stops the robot in its tracks when pressed -- the system uses sensors to avoid bumping into people or objects.
The A.I. software built into RT-2 has its own safeguards, which it can use to prevent the robot from doing anything harmful. One benign example: Google's robots can be trained not to pick up containers with water in them, because water can damage their hardware if it spills.
If you're the kind of person who worries about A.I. going rogue -- and Hollywood has given us plenty of reasons to fear that scenario, from the original "Terminator" to last year's "M3gan" -- the idea of making robots that can reason, plan and improvise on the fly probably strikes you as a terrible idea.
But at Google, it's the kind of idea researchers are celebrating. After years in the wilderness, hardware robots are back -- and they have their chatbot brains to thank.

A one-armed robot stood in front of a table. On the table sat three plastic figurines: a lion, a whale and a dinosaur.
An engineer gave the robot an instruction: “Pick up the extinct animal.”
The robot whirred for a moment, then its arm extended and its claw opened and descended. It grabbed the dinosaur.
Until very recently, this demonstration, which I witnessed during a podcast interview at Google’s robotics division in Mountain View, California, last week, would have been impossible. Robots weren’t able to reliably manipulate objects they had never seen before, and they certainly weren’t capable of making the logical leap from “extinct animal” to “plastic dinosaur.”
But a quiet revolution is underway in robotics, one that piggybacks on recent advances in so-called large language models — the same type of artificial intelligence system that powers ChatGPT, Bard and other chatbots.
Google has recently begun plugging state-of-the-art language models into its robots, giving them the equivalent of artificial brains. The secretive project has made the robots far smarter and given them new powers of understanding and problem-solving.

Plan to Double Total of Fast Chargers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The companies will jointly spend at least $ 1 billion to build a North American network in an effort to persuade more people to buy battery-powered cars and trucks.
Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- will initially invest at least $ 1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers -- those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford Motor and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, G.M. and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, said. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, though, so far, it has made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and G.M. plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly -- taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren't many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Ms. Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
"In states where E.V. adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers," she said. "That is where you are going to have the most impact."
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the chief executive of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
"The most mature market is California, and we're not saturated in California yet," Ms. Zoi said. "Potential buyers of E.V.s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations."
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with G.M. to build fast-charging stations, and Ms. Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state's northern city, Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
“In states where EV adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers,” she said. “That is where you are going to have the most impact.”
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the CEO of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
“The most mature market is California, and we’re not saturated in California yet,” Zoi said. “Potential buyers of EV’s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations.”
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with GM to build fast-charging stations, and Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state’s northern city Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Huge in Mexico. Struggling With Mom.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fleeing the strictures of modern life in a hypercompetitive South Korea, a young woman found a calmer way of life in Mexico -- and millions of social media followers.
To her mother in South Korea, SuJin Kim is a failure: She's over 30, single and not working for a big Korean corporation.
But to her millions of followers in Latin America, she has become a relatable friend and a teacher of all things Korean. In Mexico, where she lives, they know her, in fact, as "Chinguamiga," her online nickname, a mash-up of the words for friend in Korean and Spanish.
Her success has been propelled not just by her ingenuity and charisma, but also by a wave of South Korean popular culture that has swept the world, driven in part by a government effort to position the country as a cultural giant and to exert a soft power.
In her homeland, Ms. Kim, 32, struggled with the grind of a hypercompetitive society where success is defined narrowly and young women face diminishing labor prospects, grueling work schedules, sexism and restrictive beauty standards.
In Mexico, the growing interest in all things Korean has made her a social-media sensation with more than 24 million followers on TikTok and over eight million subscribers to her YouTube channel, allowing her to gain popularity, financial stability and a romantic partner -- all on her own terms.
"There was a packaging that she came with," said Dr. Renato Balderrama, who leads the Center for Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, an industrial hub with an expanding Korean presence. "She had all this training in Korea, in this new Korea that allows her to land in a place like Mexico and be successful."
A sort of a teacher of comparative pop culture, Ms. Kim offers lessons on popular Korean soap operas, lyrics, fashion standards, traditions and social norms. She once worked as a waitress in Mexico for a day and posted about her confusion with tips. (South Korea is a no-tip country.) She showed followers how Korean students crammed for exams. She started traveling across Mexico tasting regional delicacies.
Her social media success has attracted invitations to events, award nominations, magazine spreads and sponsorship deals, and yielded a popular business teaching Korean language classes online. She moved from Monterrey to Mexico City to gain more exposure and grow her brand.
Ms. Kim's budding empire now includes an online store of Korean beauty products. She will be featured as a contestant in the second season of HBO's "Bake Off Celebrity" show.
Ms. Kim's success tracks the growth of Korean influence in Mexico and the region.More than 2,000 Korean companies have a presence in Mexico, part of a so-called near-shoring strategy that has driven larger corporations -- Kia, LG, Samsung, Hyundai, among others -- to take advantage of a free-trade agreement with Canada and the United States.
South Korea has not only arrived in Mexico with jobs, cars and cellphones, but also with something more intangible: its own idea of modern culture. K-pop, K-beauty and K-dramas have shown Latin Americans a new, different way to be cool.
K-pop bands have been performing to increasingly bigger and sold-out venues since 2012. This year, a summer festival will bring 16 Korean groups to Mexico City, with ticket prices starting at around $ 170.
Some newsstands specialize in magazines, posters and merchandise about South Korean celebrities. Netflix offers dubbing in "Latin Spanish" for Korean shows. Movie theaters stream live K-pop concerts performed abroad.
Ms. Kim grew up in Seoul but after a work-study stint in Canada and traveling through South America, she returned home and found life in South Korea stifling.
"I don't want to go back to my old life," she remembered thinking.
She moved to Mexico in 2018, driven by a desire to experience life in Latin America and trying to escape severe burnout. She worked for a Korean multinational corporation and found the work rhythm all too familiar so she started teaching Korean.
Then the pandemic upended the world.
"It's my moment, I have nothing to do," she recalled thinking before she started to post her Korean classes on YouTube. "I had zero views, nobody saw me."
Her videos were straightforward language lessons "Easy Words in Korean -- 3 Minutes!" But then she pivoted to TikTok and uploaded a short clip, this time explaining Korean culture.
"That same day it had like 5,000 views and I was like, what?!" she said, her pointy nails adorned with jeweled stars, bows and moons.
Very quickly, her TikTok following exploded.
One afternoon this year, Ms. Kim welcomed her students to a virtual Korean class on Zoom; she charges $ 35 to $ 45 for each four-week session, with one 90-minute class per week.
When the class started, 76 students had logged on. There were young girls and bespectacled moms and at least one longhaired businessman, spread across Central and South America.
Ms. Kim's bright blue curls bounced on the screen as she moved her head approvingly.
When a student trying to figure out how to pluralize singular nouns asked, "No plural?" she chirped: "No! How neat, right?"
After finishing college in South Korea, Ms. Kim said she experienced severe stress. "I wanted to die and I wished to rest," she said in one of her most popular videos. She has spoken openly about being hospitalized to take care of her mental health.
She attributes her exhaustion to Korea's culture of sacrifice and grind that helped the country become an economic powerhouse after the Korean War.
"Everything is quick, quick, now, right this second," Dr. Balderrama said. "This created a culture where there's no place for mediocrity, there's no place for those unwilling to compete."
In Mexico, Ms. Kim hoped to find a more joyous life: "I saw how Latin culture is, how Latin people live and they're living happily," she said. "I don't want to waste a single moment I'm in Latin America because it's so precious to me."
But if Ms. Kim has found a passion and a business, she has not completely found the peace of mind she was seeking. She's in therapy to deal with what she described as some depression and anxiety.
Her large following and popularity has bred fear: "I feel people will forget me, that nobody will like me," she said, worried about the toll of having to come up with creative content to remain relevant.
"I also have this problem with haters, with people's comments, which affect me," she added.
She does get criticized online by users who say she should go back to Korea, who ask whether she pays taxes in Mexico (she says she does) and who consider her another foreigner lured by life on the cheap and who contribute to the gentrification of parts of the country at the expense of Mexican residents.
In a recent video,as she prepared to go home for a visit she showed an ID card that she said was proof of her status as a legal resident. She wanted to dispel any rumors she had to leave the country because she was on a tourist visa.
Ms. Kim declined to discuss her citizenship status with The New York Times, but months ago she posted a video in which she said she'd taken the exam to become a citizen of Mexico.
By many standards, Ms. Kim has made it. But what about her mother's standards?
"I don't think she'll change her mind about success -- that I'm not a success, that's a fact for her," she said following her visit home. "She's still more worried than happy for me."
Still, after meeting Ms. Kim's boyfriend and his family in South Korea, her parents promised to visit her in Mexico.

Survey of U.S. Cities Shows Nearly 10% Drop in Homicides: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a surge during the height of Covid, killings have fallen but remain well above prepandemic levels.
In 2020, amid the disruptions of the pandemic and the social upheaval following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the United States saw the largest increase in its homicide rate in modern history. Now, more than three years after the start of the pandemic, the country is on track to record one of its largest -- if not the largest -- annual declines in homicides, according to a report released on Thursday.
Even so, violent crime is still considerably higher than just before the pandemic, the benchmark that police chiefs and city leaders are striving to return to, as cities remain awash in guns.
In the new report, the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice examined crime data from 30 U.S. cities -- including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Denver -- and found that through the first half of the year there were 202 fewer homicides, a drop of more than 9 percent. Still, homicides across those cities are 24 percent higher than in same period of 2019.
"I would call the result heartening," said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who was the lead author of the report. "Not a cause for celebration. Most cities have not returned to the homicide levels that were prevailing just prior to the height of the pandemic. So we have a ways to go."
The latest data at least offers a hopeful sign that the increases in violent crime during the pandemic were not the start of a new era of steadily rising crime, as many experts have worried. But the data is limited to the cities in which the council could obtain data, and the authors cautioned that for some categories only a few cities released statistics.
Gun assaults, for instance, declined 5.6 percent -- a positive sign for gun violence overall -- but that was based on only the 10 cities in the study that provided gun assault data. Robberies, burglaries and larcenies were also down. Car thefts, which have risen substantially in recent years, partially because of the ease in which teenagers have been able to steal Kia and Hyundai models, rose even further.
The council began tracking crime at the start of the pandemic, seeking to provide a timely snapshot of national trends and fill the void in comprehensive data from government agencies. The F.B.I., which typically releases national statistics in the fall for the prior year, has been hampered by a shift in 2021 to a new reporting system that saw several large cities, such as Chicago and New York, fail to submit data.
Just as criminologists struggle to reach a consensus to explain sudden increases in crime like the United States saw in 2020, concrete explanations for declines in crime are similarly elusive.
"It's like explaining the score at halftime," said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst based in New Orleans who tracks homicides across American cities and levels of law enforcement staffing. "Even if you are up by two touchdowns, it's still halftime. And so understanding that context makes it hard to say, 'Oh it's because it's x, y or z.' We don't have a strong understanding yet. And it'll be a little while until we do have an understanding."
But many agree that the disruptions of the pandemic -- the social isolation, the closure of schools and jobs lost -- likely led to an increase in crime. More contentious is an unproven theory cited by some experts that amid the social unrest that followed the murder of Mr. Floyd, officers in some places pulled back from enforcement and some citizens, distrustful of law enforcement, stopped working with police.
Notably, violent crime has fallen at a time when many police departments are smaller than they were before the pandemic. While the defund the police movement, which grew out of the Floyd protests, lost momentum as crime rose, police staffing levels declined in many cities as officers retired or quit and as many departments struggled to recruit new officers in a competitive U.S. job market. The result for some major cities has been an unintended experiment in what a smaller police department looks like.
Los Angeles, for example, is down about 1,000 officers since 2019 -- it had about 9,200 officers at the end of last year -- and hundreds of civilian workers. And yet homicides are down more than 20 percent this year, and overall gun violence has fallen at a similar clip.
"We are still not done with getting back to crime levels, community safety levels, that we saw just four years ago," Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department said in an interview. He added: "We're not home free because of the persistence of gun violence, and the persistence of too many guns in too many hands."
With fewer officers, Mr. Moore said the department was relying on overtime and on focusing resources on the most serious violent and property crimes. He said that the department was not responding as quickly as it used to for lesser issues, like neighborhood disputes or loud, late-night parties. The department's goal is to hire 700 more officers and 300 more civilians this year.
"The service levels have been impacted," he said, adding that the change has come at the expense of community members who typically interact with the police only on that type of lower level issue. That "gives me concern because it undermines their sense of confidence and their sense of safety in the department, and in government," he said.
A similar dynamic of smaller departments and falling crime has also played out in Philadelphia, which had about 5,800 officers at the end of last year, more than 700 fewer than in 2019. The city saw homicides decline more than 20 percent and has spent millions of dollars in overtime.
In Minneapolis, whose homicide data is not included in the council's report, violent crime is also down substantially, and the department has about 300 fewer officers than in 2019. To maintain the reductions in crime, the department has said it would focus its limited resources this summer on crime hot spots in the city.
Even with the increases in recent years, violent crime is still far below its historical peaks reached in the early 1990s. In periods of the last century when murders and violent crime surged, policymakers responded with ever harsher criminal justice policies: mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, tough new laws for juvenile offenders and massive increases in policing, all of which led to mass incarceration.
And as crime rose in recent years, some mayors and governors did respond with tough-on-crime rhetoric. But, at least so far, there have not been major policy shifts toward more punitive measures like during the 1980s and 1990s, said Jeffrey A. Fagan, an expert on crime and policing at Columbia Law School. Efforts to overhaul bail systems are continuing and progressive prosecutors are being elected in many cities, which, he said, "showed that you really didn't need these harsh measures that were put in place to have violence rates and murder rates decline."

Lewis Branscomb, 96, Who Championed Science From Space Race to the Internet: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He led scientific advances at IBM and within the federal government during a career that spanned the space race and the dawn of the internet.
As the Cold War was waning, the physicist Lewis Branscomb feared that America's economic and scientific superiority was in jeopardy. Declining scientific literacy and critical thinking in American education, he believed, could have disastrous consequences for the country.
Students, he told "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS in 1986, "don't need to know a lot of facts about science, but they really do need to understand how to think in the way scientists think -- that is, in a problem-solving approach, given a complex environment within which to make decisions."
Whether in academia, private industry or government, Dr. Branscomb made it his job to push for the advancement of science and give it a bigger role in public policy. He held out hope for a brighter future through technology, but only if scientists and policymakers could get the public behind the idea.
Dr. Branscomb, who worked at the nexus of science, technology, policy and business throughout his career, died on May 31 at a care facility in Redwood City, Calif., his son, Harvie, said. He was 96.
Dr. Branscomb led the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology), the federal government's authoritative standards and measurements laboratory, from 1969 to 1972. He later served as IBM's chief scientist, was a professor at Harvard University, wrote hundreds of papers and wrote or contributed to about a dozen books.
Dr. Branscomb started working for the government in the wake of World War II, and almost six decades later advised the Senate on America's vulnerabilities after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
In the interim, he developed basic scientific techniques and refined measurements at the National Bureau of Standards; helped IBM turn its computers from hulking mainframes, which could cost more than an automobile, into something that could fit in a home office; and advised multiple presidents, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, on policy matters, particularly the space program.
Irving Wladawsky-Berger, a former IBM researcher and executive, said in a phone interview that Dr. Branscomb played a major role at the company when it was leading the development of technology like computer memory and storage, networking products and semiconductors. Dr. Branscomb "had the vision of making sure that IBM was a world class research company," he said.
Dr. Branscomb called for technological growth to be driven as much by private industry as by the Defense Department and other government agencies, and expressed concern that the end of the space race with the Soviet Union had led to a diminished NASA.
"Where once NASA challenged industry to go beyond what any had done before," he said in testimony before Congress in 1991, " today, the best commercial firms take more risk, stretch their technology further, reach for levels of performance and reliability that NASA no longer achieves or even expects."
It fell to scientists to rekindle society's enthusiasm for their work, Dr. Branscomb wrote in "Confessions of a Technophile" (1995), arguing that it was up to the scientific community "to acknowledge the legitimacy of the public's desire to participate, however superficially, in the excitement of new discovery."
Lewis McAdory Branscomb was born on Aug. 17, 1926, in Asheville, N.C., to Harvie and Margaret (Vaughan) Branscomb. His father was the dean of the theology school and the library director at Duke University and then the chancellor of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. His mother oversaw the planting of magnolia trees across the Vanderbilt campus and was memorialized with a statue there.
A promising student from a young age, Lewis left high school early and received an accelerated education at Duke as part of a Navy program to train future scientists.
He earned a bachelor's degree in physics by 19, then served as an officer in the Naval Reserve. He left Naval duty in 1946 to enroll at Harvard, where he earned his master's degree a year later and his doctorate in 1949.
In 1951, Dr. Branscomb became a research physicist studying the structure and spectra of molecular and atomic negative ions for the National Bureau of Standards, an arm of the Commerce Department and one of the oldest federal physical science research laboratories.
In the early 1960s he moved from Washington to Boulder, Col., where he helped establish the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, now known as JILA, a collaboration between the Bureau of Standards and the University of Colorado that sought to advance astrophysical research. He later served as the institute's chair.
He joined President Johnson's Science Advisory Committee in the mid-1960s, as the Apollo program was preparing to land astronauts on the moon in 1969. That year, President Nixon named him the Bureau of Standards' director, a position he held until he left for IBM in 1972.
He was IBM's chief scientist until 1986, a period when the company made components for the space shuttle, built computer mainframes and entered the personal computer market against competitors like Apple and Tandy.
In 1980, Dr. Branscomb became the chairman of the National Science Board, which establishes the policies of the National Science Foundation and advises Congress and the president. He held that position until 1984.
Dr. Branscomb left IBM to become a professor and the director of the Science, Technology and Public Policy Program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He also served on boards of corporations like Mobil and General Foods.
Books he wrote and edited include "Empowering Technology: Implementing a U.S. Policy" (1993) and "Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism" (2002, with Richard Klausner and others).
Dr. Branscomb married Margaret Anne Wells, a lawyer and expert on computer communications, in the early 1950s. She died in 1997.
In 2005 he married Constance Hammond Mullin, with whom he lived for many years in the La Jolla section of San Diego. She survives him.
In addition to his wife and son, his survivors include a daughter, K.C. Kelley; three stepchildren, Stephen J. Mullin, Keith Mullin and Laura Thompson; and a granddaughter.
In the preface to "Confessions of a Technophile" Dr. Branscomb described himself as an "incurable optimist" who had been "driven all my life by a deep conviction that bright prospects for humankind depend on the wise and creative uses of technology."
He added in a footnote that he was an optimist not by logic but "by assertion."

Full text: Murders and rapes were also down, part of a nationwide trend after a post-pandemic spike.
Shootings in New York City dropped by about 25 percent through the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, extending a downward trend after a spike in violent crime during the pandemic.
The sharp drop, which mirrored similar decreases across the United States, came amid widespread fears about crime in the city, which officials have blamed for keeping workers and suburbanites cloistered in their homes.
At a briefing on Thursday, Edward Caban, the acting police commissioner, said that shootings had declined for 13 consecutive weeks. The numbers were released at the beginning of summer, when violence historically rises, but he said he was "confident" that the department's positive streak would continue in the summer.
"It is no coincidence," Mr. Caban said. "From the beginning of this administration, we made the fight against gun violence our top priority."
Through Sunday, reports of five of the seven offenses that the Police Department ranks as major felonies had gone down, while two increased, police data show. Murders, rapes and burglaries decreased by about 10 percent each; robberies fell nearly 5 percent. But car thefts increased 18 percent and felony assaults by 6 percent.
Michael Lipetri, chief of crime control strategies, tied the increase in car thefts to the ease of stealing certain models of cars. "You could basically steal a Hyundai or a Kia in seconds," he said on Thursday.
Transit crimes, which have overall fallen by nearly 4 percent this year, increased by about 19 percent over the past month compared to the same period last year, according to Police Department data. Officials did not shed light on the spike at the news conference.
Crime data is a "roller coaster," said Jeffrey A. Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School. Causality, he said, is "almost impossible to prove," though police departments often take credit.
"Crime goes up, crime goes down, people are alarmed and the police department changes its tactics," he said. "Whatever changes they've made, they don't seem able to interrupt this cycle."
"What they're observing in New York is happening all over the country," Mr. Fagan said.
At the beginning of last year, as the pandemic eased and people began returning to their routines, the city struggled to stem an increase in violence.
Mayor Eric Adams, whose tenure began in 2022, made reversing the trend, specifically reining in gun violence, a central goal. Mr. Adams appointed a "gun violence czar." He also expanded a jobs program and Saturday Night Lights, which offers activities for children between the ages of 11 and 18.
But the crime-fighting approaches of Mr. Adams and the Police Department have also been met with criticism.
Last year, the department announced an initiative designed to enforce what they called quality-of-life crimes, focusing on things like public drinking, urination and disorderly groups. Critics said that the enforcement is a return to "broken windows" policing, the enforcement of low-level offenses in an effort to prevent more serious crimes, which they said results in harassment.
In June, a court-appointed monitor found that anti-crime units, then under the leadership of the former commissioner, Keechant Sewell, were still stopping, frisking and searching too many people, despite assurances from Mr. Adams that new policies and training would prevent the problem. A report from The City this week found that there had been a 600 percent increase in police vehicle pursuits in the year's first three months.
For David Caba, vice president at Bronx Rises Against Gun Violence, the drop in gun violence that the department emphasized on Thursday reflects the work of social service organizations such as his.
Since the pandemic disruptions have ebbed, his teams, which operate in six zones within the Bronx, have seen shootings and homicides fall, he said. The zones are each made up of about 12 to 15 blocks that have grappled with high rates of violence. One zone has gone over a year without a single shooting or murder, he said.
"It takes everyone," he said, adding: "It ain't just one entity that's going to come in and provide a remedy."

Ford's U.S. Sales Rose 10% in Second Quarter
Ford Motor said Thursday that its new-vehicle sales rose 10 percent in the three months of April through June, thanks to robust demand for trucks. The automaker sold 531,662 motor vehicles, up from 483,688 in the second quarter last year, as sales of pickups, delivery vans and heavy trucks increased 26 percent. The gain in truck sales more than offset a decline of nearly 3 percent in sales of electric vehicles. Ford sold 14,843 battery-powered cars and trucks in the quarter, down from 15,273 a year earlier. It has had to slow production to upgrade assembly lines. The upgrade work mainly affected the Mustang Mach-E, whose sales declined 21 percent in the second quarter. Ford also sold 4,466 F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks in the quarter. That was more than double the total from a year earlier and the second-highest quarterly total since the truck went on sale. On Wednesday, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai and Kia reported increases of 14 percent or more. Overall, automakers sold more than 4.1 million cars and trucks in the second quarter, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm, an increase of 16 percent from a year earlier. The total, however, was about 400,000 fewer cars than the industry typically sold in the second quarter before the coronavirus pandemic. Sales remain below their prepandemic levels because parts shortages have forced automakers to produce fewer vehicles for much of the last three years. The supply of computer chips, which have been particularly hard to get, has improved in recent months. NEAL E. BOUDETTE

Amazon's iRobot Deal Is in E.U.'s Cross Hairs
Amazon's $ 1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot may reduce competition and strengthen Amazon's position as an online marketplace provider, European Union antitrust regulators warned on Thursday. The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation and will decide by Nov. 15 whether to clear or block the deal for iRobot, the robot vacuum cleaner maker. "We continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage," an Amazon spokesperson said. Antitrust enforcers around the world have increased scrutiny of Big Tech acquiring smaller rivals, concerned about the accumulation of data by a few companies, and big players leveraging their dominance into new markets. The acquisition announced last August that it would add iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum to Amazon's portfolio of smart devices, which include the Alexa voice assistant, smart thermostats, security devices and wall-mounted smart displays. IRobot made its first Roomba robot vacuum in 2002. Amazon has previously said the vacuum cleaner market is very competitive, with lots of Chinese players. "The commission is concerned that the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners and to strengthen its position as online marketplace provider," an E.U. executive said. The Amazon spokesperson also said the company could "offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers." REUTERS

New-Car Sales Take Off As Chip Shortage Eases: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors, Toyota and other automakers sold more trucks and sport utility vehicles as supply chain problems eased and demand remained strong despite rising interest rates.
Some of the country's biggest automakers reported big sales increases for the second quarter on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the auto industry was bouncing back from parts shortages and overcoming the effects of higher interest rates.
General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, said it sold 691,978 vehicles from April to June, up 19 percent from a year earlier. It was the company's highest quarterly total in more than two years.
Automakers have struggled in the last two years with a shortage of computer chips that forced factory shutdowns and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. More recently, rising interest rates have made auto loans more expensive, causing some consumers to defer purchases or opt for used vehicles.
"I'm not saying we are on the cusp of exciting growth here," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a research firm. "But we are now at a turning point where the auto market returns to more balance. It's the beginning of returning to normal."
The easing of chip shortages has allowed automakers to restock dealer lots, making it easier for car buyers to find the models and features they want, Mr. Smoke said. At the end of June, dealers had about 1.8 million vehicles in stock, nearly 800,000 more than at the same point in 2022, according to Cox data.
Sales have also been helped by strong job creation and rising wages, Mr. Smoke said.
At the same time, however, higher interest rates and higher car prices have put new-car purchases out of reach of many consumers. In the first half of the year, the average price paid for a new vehicle was a near-record $ 48,564. The average interest rate paid on car loans in the first six months of 2023 was 7.09 percent, up from 4.86 percent a year earlier, according to Cox. The average monthly payment in the first half was $ 784, up from $ 691.
"Demand will be limited by the level of prices and rates, which are not likely to come down enough to stimulate more demand than the market can bear," Mr. Smoke said.
Cox estimated that total sales of new cars and trucks rose 11.6 percent in the first half of the year, to 7.65 million. The firm now expects full-year sales to top 15 million, which would be a rise of 8 percent.
Several automakers reported solid quarterly sales on Wednesday. Toyota said its U.S. sales rose 7 percent, to 568,962 cars and light trucks. Stellantis, the company that owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other brands, reported a 6 percent rise, to 434,648 vehicles.
Honda, which had been severely hampered by chip shortages, said its sales rose 45 percent to 347,025 cars and trucks. Hyundai and Kia, the South Korean automakers, each sold more than 210,000 vehicles, posting gains of 14 percent and 15 percent.
Electric vehicles remain the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Rivian, a maker of electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, said on Monday that it delivered 12,640 in the second quarter, a 59 percent jump from a year earlier. And on Sunday, Tesla reported an 83 percent jump in global sales in the second quarter.
Cox estimated that more than 500,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the first six months of the year, and that more than one million would be sold in 2023, setting a record for battery-powered cars and trucks in the country.
Tesla, which does not break out its sales by country, remains the largest seller of E.V.s in the U.S. market. Cox estimated that the company sold more than 161,000 electric cars in the second quarter in the United States. Ford Motor, which offers three fully electric models., reports its quarterly sales on Thursday.
G.M. sold more 15,300 battery-powered cars and trucks, but nearly 14,000 were the Chevrolet Bolt, a smaller vehicle that the company will stop making at the end of the year. The company also sold 1,348 Cadillac Lyriq electric S.U.V.s and 47 GMC Hummer pickup trucks. Chevrolet will soon start delivering a new electric Silverado pickup truck, which uses the same battery technology as the Lyriq and Hummer.

Edward Fredkin, 88, an Innovator With a Limitless Imagination, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An influential M.I.T. professor and an outside-the-box scientific theorist, he gained fame with unorthodox views as a pioneer in digital physics.
Edward Fredkin, who despite never having graduated from college became an influential professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a pioneer in artificial intelligence and a maverick theorist who championed the idea that the entire universe might function like one big computer, died on June 13 in Brookline, Mass. He was 88.
His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his son Richard.
Fueled by a seemingly limitless scientific imagination and a blithe indifference to conventional thinking, Professor Fredkin charged through an endlessly mutating career that could appear as mind-warping as the iconoclastic theories that made him a force in both computer science and physics.
"Ed Fredkin had more ideas per day than most people have in a month," Gerald Sussman, a professor of electronic engineering and a longtime colleague at M.I.T., said in a phone interview. "Most of them were bad, and he would have agreed with me on that. But out of those, there were good ideas, too. So he had more good ideas in a lifetime than most people ever have."
After serving as a fighter pilot in the Air Force in the early 1950s, Professor Fredkin became a renowned, if unconventional, scientific thinker. He was a close friend and intellectual sparring partner of the celebrated physicist Richard Feynman and the computer scientist Marvin Minsky, a trailblazer in artificial intelligence.
An autodidact who left college after a year, he nonetheless became a full professor of computer science at M.I.T. at 34. He later taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and at Boston University.
Not content to confine his energies to the ivory tower, Professor Fredkin in 1962 founded a company that built programmable film readers, allowing computers to analyze data captured by cameras, such as Air Force radar information.
That company, Information International Incorporated, went public in 1968, bringing him a fortune. With his new wealth he bought a Caribbean island in the British Virgin Islands, to which he traveled in his Cessna 206 seaplane. The island lacked potable water, so Professor Fredkin developed a reverse-osmosis technology to desalinate seawater, which he turned into another business.
He eventually sold the property, Mosquito Island, to the British billionaire Richard Branson for $ 25 million.
Professor Fredkin's life was filled with paradoxes, so it was only fitting that he was credited with his own. Fredkin's paradox, as it is known, posits that when one is deciding between two options, the more similar they are the more time one spends fretting about the decision, even though the difference in choosing one or the other may be insignificant. Conversely, when the difference is more substantial or meaningful, one is likely to spend less time deciding.
As an early researcher in artificial intelligence a half-century ago, Professor Fredkin foreshadowed the current debates about hyper-intelligent machines.
"It requires a combination of engineering and science, and we already have the engineering," he Fredkin said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. "In order to produce a machine that thinks better than man, we don't have to understand everything about man. We still don't understand feathers, but we can fly."
As a starting point, he helped pave the way for machines to checkmate the Bobby Fischers of the world. A developer of an early processing system for chess, Professor Fredkin in 1980 created the Fredkin Prize, a $ 100,000 award that he offered to whoever could develop the first computer program to win the world chess championship.
In 1997, a team of IBM programmers did just that, taking home the six-figure bounty when their computer, Deep Blue, beat Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion.
"There has never been any doubt in my mind that a computer would ultimately beat a reigning world chess champion," Professor Fredkin said at the time. "The question has always been when."
Edward Fredkin was born on Oct. 2, 1934, in Los Angeles, the youngest of four children of immigrants from Russia. His father, Manuel Fredkin, ran a chain of radio stores that failed during the Great Depression. His mother, Rose (Spiegel) Fredkin, was a pianist.
Cerebral and socially awkward as a youth, Edward avoided sports and school dances, preferring to lose himself in hobbies like building rockets, designing fireworks and dismantling and rebuilding old alarm clocks. "I always got along well with machines," he told The Atlantic Monthly in 1988.
After high school, he enrolled in the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where he studied with the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling. Lured by his desire to fly, however, he left school in his sophomore year to join the Air Force.
During the Korean War, he trained to fly fighter jets. But his prodigious skills with mathematics and technology landed him work on military computer systems instead of in combat. To further his education in computer science, the Air Force eventually sent him to M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory, a wellspring of technological innovation funded by the Pentagon.
It was the start of a long tenure at M.I.T., where in the 1960s he helped develop early versions of multiple access computers as a part of a Pentagon-funded program called Project MAC. The program also explored machine-aided cognition, an early investigation into artificial intelligence.
"He was one of the world's first computer programmers," Professor Sussman said.
Professor Fredkin was chosen to direct the project in 1971 and became a full-time faculty member shortly thereafter.
As his career developed, he continued to challenge mainstream scientific thinking. He made major advances in reversible computing, an esoteric field combining computer science and thermodynamics.
With a pair of innovations -- the billiard-ball computer model, which he developed with Tommaso Toffoli, and the Fredkin Gate -- he demonstrated that computation is not inherently irreversible. Those advances suggest that computation need not consume energy by overwriting the intermediate results of a computation, and that it is theoretically possible to build a computer that does not consume energy or produce heat.
But none of his insights stoked more debate than his famous theories on digital physics, a niche field in which he became a leading theorist.
His universe-as-one-giant-computer theory, as described by the author and science writer Robert Wright in The Atlantic Monthly in 1988, is based on the idea that "information is more fundamental than matter and energy." Professor Fredkin, Mr. Wright said, believed that "atoms, electrons and quarks consist ultimately of bits -- binary units of information, like those that are the currency of computation in a personal computer or a pocket calculator."
As Professor Fredkin was quoted as saying in that article, DNA, the fundamental building block of heredity, is "a good example of digitally encoded information."
"The information that implies what a creature or a plant is going to be is encoded," he said. "It has its representation in the DNA, right? OK, now, there is a process that takes that information and transforms it into the creature."
Even a creature as ordinary as a mouse, he concluded, "is a big, complicated informational process."
Professor Fredkin and his first wife, Dorothy Fredkin, divorced in 1980. In addition to his son Richard, he is survived by his wife, Joycelin; a son, Michael, and two daughters, Sally and Susan, from his first marriage; a brother, Norman; a sister, Joan Entz; six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
By the end of his life, Professor Fredkin's theory of the universe remained fringe, if intriguing. "Most of the physicists don't think it's true," Professor Sussman said. "I'm not sure if Fredkin believed it was true, either. But certainly there's a lot to learn by thinking that way."
His early views on artificial intelligence, by contrast, seem more prescient by the day.
"In the distant future we won't know what computers are doing, or why," he told The Times in 1977. "If two of them converse, they'll say in a second more than all the words spoken during all the lives of all the people who ever lived on this planet."
Even so, unlike many current doomsayers, he did not feel a sense of existential dread. "Once there are clearly intelligent machines," he said, "they won't be interested in stealing our toys or dominating us, any more than they would be interested in dominating chimpanzees or taking nuts away from squirrels."

Higher Tech Raises Cost To Fix Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: More technology and creature comforts, as well as a parade of new electric vehicles, have complicated the job after accidents.
New cars and trucks are packed with sensors and technology that protect and pamper drivers and passengers. But those features are also raising the cost of repairs after accidents.
The average cost of making damaged cars good as new has soared 36 percent since 2018, and may top $ 5,000 by the end of this year, according to Mitchell, a company that provides data and software to insurance companies and auto repair businesses. That big increase is the main reason that insurance premiums have been soaring -- up 17 percent in the 12 months through May.
New sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, including a rapidly growing number of electric models, have become so complex and luxurious that seemingly simple repairs can cost a small fortune, auto experts said. Insurers are often on the hook for much of those costs, leading them to raise their rates.
Materials designed to crumple or deform in a crash to protect pedestrians or passengers, for example, can be hard or impossible to repair. Many bumpers must be replaced after low-speed dings because the safety sensors embedded in them may no longer work properly after repairs. Other systems, even some that do not appear to be damaged, must be inspected or recalibrated.
"The modern digital architecture is so advanced that systems beyond point of impact are being disrupted," said Ryan Mandell, director of claims performance for Mitchell. "Getting a car back to pre-loss condition is harder than at any point in history, and will only become more challenging."
Industry experts have been particularly focused on the cost of repairing electric cars and trucks, which aren't built like gasoline cars and have different parts. In addition, many mechanics aren't trained to work on them. In recent months, news reports and stories shared on social media about astronomical repair bills for electric cars and trucks have captured the attention of car enthusiasts.
Consider the case of Chris Apfelstadt and his Rivian R1T pickup truck, which was rear-ended by a Lexus in February at a stoplight in Columbus, Ohio, while he was driving and his infant son was in the back seat.
The damage was initially deemed relatively minor, and the other driver's insurer offered him $ 1,600. The actual cost to fix the bumper at a business certified to repair Rivian vehicles -- one of just three in Ohio -- was $ 42,000, roughly half the truck's selling price.
"I expected it to be expensive," said Mr. Apfelstadt, who owns a lighting company, "but it was still a shocking number."
A key reason is that the accident damaged a sleek panel that extends from the truck's rear to front roof pillars. Repairing and repainting it set off a cascade of pricey work, including removing the interior ceiling material, known as the headliner, and front windshield.
Some of the cost probably also had to do with Rivian's small size and youth. Like other auto start-ups, the company, which is based in Irvine, Calif., and delivered its first vehicles to customers in 2021, does not sell through franchised dealers and has had to build an independent repair network from scratch.
Ford Motor has 2,800 North American dealers equipped to repair its electric vehicles, along with a vast network of independent shops and aftermarket suppliers. Rivian has certified about 200 North American collision shops.
"It's a challenge that we're newer to market," said Noe Mejia, Rivian's vice president of service operations. But, he added, Rivian's smaller scale and lack of bureaucracy allow it to work directly with customers and shops to ensure repairs meet high standards.
Mr. Apfelstadt's story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they're sometimes less.
"The idea that E.V.s are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night," Mr. Mandell said. "Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between."
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $ 6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $ 2,400 more than the average for all cars. Battery-powered cars tend to require more expensive parts, the company said, and repairing them takes more time and may require work by specialist mechanics.
But a big reason electric cars tend to cost much more to repair, at first glance, is that most of them are newer luxury models. Tesla's cars, which sell for between $ 40,000 and around $ 110,000, account for 75 percent of collision claims for battery-powered models.
Fixing electric vehicles from mainstream brands such as Hyundai or Nissan costs only about $ 800 more than their gasoline counterparts, according to Mitchell. And in the premium segment, typical repair costs for battery-powered and gasoline vehicles are roughly the same, around $ 7,000, for model years 2018 and later.
Other data suggests that electric vehicles fare relatively well. About 18 percent of gasoline cars involved in crashes are totaled, while only about 6 percent of battery-powered vehicles are deemed unrepairable after accidents, according to Mitchell.
Matt Moore, a senior vice president at the Highway Loss Data Institute, a research organization that serves the insurance industry, said insurance and repair data undercut the idea that batteries or electric technology racked up burdensome repair costs. For 11 models that are available in gasoline and electric versions -- including the Hyundai Kona and Volvo XC40 -- repair costs for the electric models are just 2 percent higher, according to the institute's analysis.
Gasoline or electric, Mr. Moore said, more expensive, rare and higher-performing cars tend to be involved in fewer but more severe accidents in part because they are more likely to be driven by people who speed and take other risks.
"They hit fast and hit hard," he said. "Every collision is a mix of man and machine."
But auto experts added that damage to the battery pack of electric cars -- their most expensive part -- could make them harder to repair, requiring special tools and advanced training.
"Right now, if there's serious damage to the pack, nobody is anxious to take a shot at repairing that," said Sandy Munro, an engineer and consultant who hosts a popular YouTube show on which he has interviewed Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, and others in the auto industry.
Automakers say they are aware of rising repair costs and are working to make cars easier to fix, especially electric vehicles, which many executives expect to replace most or all gasoline models in the coming decades.
BMW has equipped its electric vehicles with sensors that provide data on crash-force direction and intensity. That information can guide technicians on which battery modules need replacement. Ford has made it so its dealers can replace a damaged battery tray on the Mustang Mach-E and swap all components into a new tray. General Motors is developing a process to let dealers repair and replace packs, including individual battery modules that are damaged.
Even though repair costs are climbing, Mr. Munro emphasized that newer cars provided significant benefits over older vehicles. They can absorb horrifying crash forces and let occupants walk away. Or they avoid collisions entirely, using the same cameras and sensors that make for trickier repairs.
"If nobody dies but we can't fix that bumper, I don't care about that," he said. "It's only scrap iron. The focus is rightly on the people inside and the efficiency of the car."

Why Car Repairs Have Become So Expensive

New cars and trucks are packed with sensors and technology that protect and pamper drivers and passengers. But those features are also raising the cost of repairs after accidents.
The average cost of making damaged cars good as new has soared 36% since 2018, and may top $5,000 by the end of this year, according to Mitchell, a company that provides data and software to insurance companies and auto repair businesses. That big increase is the main reason that insurance premiums have been soaring — up 17% in the 12 months through May.
New SUVs and pickup trucks, including a rapidly growing number of electric models, have become so complex and luxurious that seemingly simple repairs can cost a small fortune, auto experts said. Insurers are often on the hook for much of those costs, leading them to raise their rates.
Materials designed to crumple or deform in a crash to protect pedestrians or passengers, for example, can be hard or impossible to repair. Many bumpers must be replaced after low-speed dings because the safety sensors embedded in them may no longer work properly after repairs. Other systems, even some that do not appear to be damaged, must be inspected or recalibrated.
“The modern digital architecture is so advanced that systems beyond point of impact are being disrupted,” said Ryan Mandell, director of claims performance for Mitchell. “Getting a car back to pre-loss condition is harder than at any point in history, and will only become more challenging.”
Industry experts have been particularly focused on the cost of repairing electric cars and trucks, which aren’t built like gasoline cars and have different parts. In addition, many mechanics aren’t trained to work on them. In recent months, news reports and stories shared on social media about astronomical repair bills for electric cars and trucks have captured the attention of car enthusiasts.
Consider the case of Chris Apfelstadt and his Rivian R1T pickup truck, which was rear-ended by a Lexus in February at a stoplight in Columbus, Ohio, while he was driving and his infant son was in the back seat.
The damage was initially deemed relatively minor, and the other driver’s insurer offered him $1,600. The actual cost to fix the bumper at a business certified to repair Rivian vehicles — one of just three in Ohio — was $42,000, roughly half the truck’s selling price.
“I expected it to be expensive,” said Apfelstadt, who owns a lighting company, “but it was still a shocking number.”
A key reason is that the accident damaged a sleek panel that extends from the truck’s rear to front roof pillars. Repairing and repainting it set off a cascade of pricey work, including removing the interior ceiling material, known as the headliner, and front windshield.
Some of the cost probably also had to do with Rivian’s small size and youth. Like other auto startups, the company, which is based in Irvine, California, and delivered its first vehicles to customers in 2021, does not sell through franchised dealers and has had to build an independent repair network from scratch.
Ford Motor has 2,800 North American dealers equipped to repair its electric vehicles, along with a vast network of independent shops and aftermarket suppliers. Rivian has certified about 200 North American collision shops.
“It’s a challenge that we’re newer to market,” said Noe Mejia, Rivian’s vice president of service operations. But, he added, Rivian’s smaller scale and lack of bureaucracy allow it to work directly with customers and shops to ensure repairs meet high standards.
Apfelstadt’s story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they’re sometimes less.
“The idea that EVs are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night,” Mandell said. “Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between.”
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $2,400 more than the average for all cars.

Electrify America to Add Tesla Plugs at Its Stations
The second-largest electric vehicle fast-charging network in the U.S. says it will add Tesla's connector to its charging stations, another step toward adopting Tesla's plug as the industry standard. Electrify America, with 800 direct-current fast-charging stations and more than 3,600 plugs nationwide, said Thursday it would work to add Tesla's connector to existing and future chargers by 2025. The company also will keep the Combined Charging System, or CCS, connector at its stations. At present most electric vehicle models in the U.S. use the CCS connector. But Ford, General Motors, Rivian and Volvo have said they would join Tesla's large Supercharger network and adopt its North American Charging Standard connector in new versions of their electric vehicles. Others such as Stellantis and Hyundai are considering joining Tesla's network. ASSOCIATED PRESS
SPACEFLIGHT
Italian Researchers Soar to the Edge of Space
A team of Italian researchers reached the edge of space Thursday, flying aboard a rocket-powered plane piloted by Virgin Galactic as the space tourism company prepares for monthly commercial flights. The flight launched from Spaceport America in the New Mexico desert, with two Italian Air Force officers and an engineer with the National Research Council of Italy focusing on a series of microgravity experiments during their few minutes of weightlessness. One wore a special suit that measured biometric data and physiological responses while another conducted tests using sensors to track heart rate, brain function and other metrics while in microgravity. The third studied how certain liquids and solids mix in that very weak gravity. Virgin Galactic livestreamed the flight, showing the moment when the ship released from its carrier plane and the rocket was ignited. The entire trip took about 90 minutes. The space plane reached a peak altitude of more than 52 miles. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Fall in Jobless Claims is Sign of Resilience
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in 20 months, the latest sign of the economy's resilience that could push the Federal Reserve to resume raising interest rates in July. The unexpected decline in applications reported by the Labor Department on Thursday reversed a recent jump, which had left initial jobless claims over the prior three weeks hovering at levels last seen in October 2021. The elevated readings had led some economists to conclude that layoffs were picking up as the economy begins to feel the heat from the Fed's hefty rate increases. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 last week. The drop was the largest since October 2021. Unadjusted claims dropped 17,843 to 233,048 last week. Claims tumbled 10,108 in California and plunged 9,187 in Texas. They dropped 3,263 in Pennsylvania, while Minnesota reported a 2,387 decline.

Harry Markowitz, Nobel Winner Who Rewrote Stock Strategy, Dies at 95: [Correction]

Full text: He overturned the traditional approach to buying stocks by examining the relationship between risk and reward.
Harry M. Markowitz, an economist who launched a revolution in finance, upending traditional thinking about buying stocks and earning the Nobel in economic science in 1990 for his breakthrough, died on Thursday in San Diego. He was 95.
The death, at a hospital, was caused by pneumonia and sepsis, Mary McDonald, a longtime assistant to Dr. Markowitz, said.
Until Dr. Markowitz came along, the investment world assumed that the best stock-market strategy was simply to choose the shares of a group of companies that were thought to have the best prospects.
But in 1952, he published his dissertation, "Portfolio Selection," which overturned this common sense approach with what became known as modern portfolio theory, widely referred to as M.P.T.
The heart of his research was grounded in the basic relationship between risk and reward. He showed that the risk in any portfolio is less dependent on the riskiness of its component stocks and other assets than how they relate to one another. It was the first time that the benefits of diversification had been codified and quantified, using advanced mathematics to calculate correlations and variations from the mean.
This breakthrough insight and its corollaries have now permeated all aspects of money management, with few professionals unfamiliar with his work.
"Modern portfolio theory has gone from the halls of academia to investment management mainstream, or from gown to town," Robert Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, a large investment manager in Newport Beach, Calif., said in a videotaped interview with Dr. Markowitz.
When Dr. Markowitz heard one of his peers describe how his work had brought "a process" to what had been, until the 1950s, the "haphazard" creation of institutional portfolios, he knew he deserved his reputation as the father of modern portfolio theory, he said.
"That moment was one of these things where you feel a chill run up your spine," he said. "I understood what I had started."
In 1999, the financial newspaper Pensions & Investments named him "man of the century."
Related work on investments led Dr. Markowitz to be regarded as a pioneer of behavioral finance, the study of how people make choices in practical situations, as in buying insurance or lottery tickets.
Recognizing that the pain of loss typically exceeds the joy of comparable gain, he found it crucial to know how a gamble is framed in terms of possible outcomes and the size of the stakes.
Dr. Markowitz won renown in two other fields. He developed "sparse matrix" techniques for solving very large mathematical optimization problems -- techniques that are now standard in production software for optimization programs. And he designed and supervised the development of Simscript, which is used for programming computer simulations of systems like factories, transportation and communications networks.
In 1989 Dr. Markowitz received the John von Neumann Theory Prize from the Operations Research Society of America for his work in portfolio theory, sparse matrix techniques and Simscript.
His focus was always on applying mathematics and computers to practical problems, particularly involving business in uncertain conditions.
"I'm not a one-shot Nobel laureate -- only doing one thing," Dr. Markowitz said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. Although he was 87 at the time, he was embarked on a monumental analysis of securities risk and return.
The seminal 1952 paper, in The Journal of Finance, was expanded into his best-known work, "Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments," in 1959.
Harry Max Markowitz was born on Aug. 24, 1927, in Chicago, the only child of Morris and Mildred Markowitz, who owned a small grocery store. In high school he began to read the original works of Darwin and such classical philosophers as René Descartes and David Hume. In financial terms, Hume's work lay behind the maxim that past performance is not a guide to the future.
He continued on this track in a two-year bachelor's program at the University of Chicago, where, inspired in part by Hume's focus on the uncertainty of knowledge, he decided to pursue economics.
It was in graduate school, where he studied under Milton Friedman and other eminent economists, that a chance conversation on possible dissertation topics led to his work applying mathematical methods to the stock market.
The basic concepts of portfolio theory came to Dr. Markowitz one afternoon in the library while reading an investment book by the economist John Burr Williams.
"Williams proposed that the value of a stock should equal the present value of its future dividends," Dr. Markowitz wrote in a brief autobiography for the Nobel committee. "Since future dividends are uncertain, I interpreted Williams's proposal to be to value a stock by its expected future dividends."
But if investors were interested only in the expected values of securities, he figured, then that implied that the best, or maximized, portfolio would consist of the single most appealing stock.
"This, I knew, was not the way investors did or should act," he concluded. "Investors diversify because they are concerned with risk as well as return."
He set out to measure the relationships among a diverse assortment of stocks to construct the most efficient portfolio, and to chart what he called a "frontier," where no additional return can be obtained without also increasing risk.
At the RAND Corporation, during stints in the 1950s and '60s, Dr. Markowitz worked on practical problems in American industry that required the development of simulation methods; he created the Simscript language to reduce their programming time.
He went on to work for IBM and General Electric, where he built models of manufacturing plants. In 1962 he co-founded the California Analysis Center Incorporated, a computer-software company that would become CACI International.
Dr. Markowitz's first two marriages, to Luella Johnson and Gloria Hardt, ended in divorce. In 1970 he married Barbara Gay. She died in 2021.
Dr. Markowitz is survived by two children from his first marriage, Susan Ulvestad and David Markowitz; two from his second, Laurie Raskin and Steven Markowitz; his wife's son from a previous marriage, James Marks; 13 grandchildren; and more than a dozen great-grandchildren. He lived in San Diego.
In 1968 Dr. Markowitz began to manage a successful hedge fund, Arbitrage Management Company, based on M.P.T., that is believed to have been the first to engage in computerized arbitrage trading.
Dr. Markowitz was a professor at Baruch College of the City University of New York when he was awarded the Nobel in economic science, sharing it with Merton H. Miller and William F. Sharpe.
He also served on the faculties of Rutgers University, the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, the University of California at Los Angeles and finally at the Rady School of Management at the University of California, San Diego.
After submitting his landmark dissertation, Dr. Markowitz took a job at RAND and was fully confident that "I know this stuff cold" when he returned to Chicago in 1955 to defend it.
Within a few minutes, however, Professor Friedman told him that while he could find no mistakes, the topic was extremely novel. "We cannot award you a Ph.D. in economics for a dissertation that is not economics," he said.
At this point, Dr. Markowitz recounted, "my palms began to sweat" and he was sent into a hallway, where he waited for about five minutes.
Finally, a panel member emerged and said, "Congratulations, Dr. Markowitz."
Dr. Markowitz insisted that he had not suspected the joke.

The Growing Industry Of 'Adventure Tourism' Inspires New Insurance: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some offer evacuations and others provide coverage for accidental death or injury to cater to the growing adventure tourism market.
The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $ 1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $ 316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. "Whether it's space or Everest, every person deserves to be found," she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.
Traditional travel insurance won't swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $ 360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises "military special operations veterans" will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $ 1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $ 3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd's of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. "But that's just the definition of their mission," Ms. Hastings argues. "We don't encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status."
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can't really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, "If there's an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people." -- Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Saudi Arabia goes shopping in Europe. Executives and government officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, blitzed Paris this week as part of a road show to attract investment and make its case to host the World Expo in 2030. The oil-rich kingdom has been on a push to diversify its economy and expand its global presence, through investments in a range of sectors including sports.
Lina Khan finally takes on Amazon. The F.T.C. chair shot to fame at the age of 29, when she wrote an academic article criticizing the tech company's dominance of large parts of the American economy. Three years later, her agency has sued Amazon over a different issue: the F.T.C. accused the company of tricking customers into signing up for Prime, its streaming and subscription shopping service.
Musk vs. Zuck? The tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have apparently agreed to a cage fight, after goading each other on social media. Mr. Musk admitted he almost never works out but the Facebook founder has recently taken up Brazilian jujitsu and competed in tournaments and endurance contests.
Prandial Peru. Central, a restaurant in Lima, was crowned the best eatery anywhere by the World's 50 Best Restaurants, one of the most prestigious lists. The venue is known for its creative approach to using domestically produced ingredients and trying to adhere to the traditions and culture of the country.
India's soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country's diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power -- and helped boost the country's image.
The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix's chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 -- at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 -- and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $ 150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $ 100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.
And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India's reputation, but "if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country."
The greatest hits of Masa Son's wild PowerPoint presentations
SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate's struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank's annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.
His presentation featured slides that asked big questions -- including "What is Mankind?" -- and the billionaire's story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it's tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook's favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as "producer of golden eggs," whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The "valley of coronavirus," a classic, shows SoftBank's winged unicorns -- that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in -- flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers "vision capital," not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies' market caps so much that those numbers ... simply couldn't be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork's fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank's profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In addition to playing with the audacious Texas band, she helped define the image of an aimless generation with her role in the 1990 film "Slacker."
Teresa Taylor, a drummer for the Texas acid-punk band Butthole Surfers who became an emblem of Generation X aimlessness and anomie with a memorable appearance in Richard Linklater's 1990 film "Slacker," died on Sunday. She was 60.
Her death was announced on Monday in a Twitter post by the band. The post said the cause was lung disease but did not say where she died.
Cheryl Curtice, her partner and caregiver, wrote on Facebook that Ms. Taylor "passed away clean and sober, peacefully in her sleep, this weekend."
Ms. Taylor, also known as Teresa Nervosa, addressed her long battle with what she called an "end stage" lung condition, which she did not identify, in a 2021 Facebook post.
"I don't have cancer or any harsh treatments," she wrote, detailing her daily use of an oxygen tank in a small apartment that had a television set mounted on a swivel fed by "mega cable," where she said she lived with her cat, Snoopy. "I know I smoked like a chimney and this is to be expected," she added. "My spirits are up."
As an irony-suffused iconoclast playing with one of the most irony-suffused and iconoclastic bands of its era, Ms. Taylor might have served as a handy mascot for a famously disaffected cohort even if she had not made a mark in the movie that gave a nickname to a generation.
She was born on Nov. 10, 1962, in Arlington, Texas, to Mickey and Helen Taylor. Her father worked for IBM as a mechanical engineer.
In her youth, she honed her skills with the drumsticks performing with marching bands in Austin and Fort Worth alongside King Coffey, who would later join her as part of Butthole Surfers' distinctive twin-drummer approach, playing in unison on separate kits.
She never considered drumming as a career. "It was like, because you were a girl, you didn't think of having any future in it," she was quoted as saying in the 2007 book "Women of the Underground: Music," by Zora von Burden.
She eventually dropped out of high school and met the singer Gibby Haynes and the guitarist Paul Leary, who had founded Butthole Surfers in San Antonio in 1981, while renting them space in the downtown Austin warehouse where she was living. In 1983, they invited her to join the band on a tour of California.
During Ms. Taylor's tenure, which lasted much of the 1980s, the band never scored a hit record. although it eventually found success atop Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart with the song "Pepper" in 1996. But mainstream acceptance was very much not the point -- as their name made clear.
Mixing a taste for Dadaism and Nietzsche with a cyclone-force howl, Butthole Surfers proved audacious even by punk standards. Concerts featured transgressive elements like naked dancers, bullhorns, garbage fires and morbid films of surgeries. "Their live shows were an assault on the senses," the music site Rock and Roll True Stories observed in a 2021 retrospective.
With its hand-grenade musical approach and black humor (the band's 1987 album, "Locust Abortion Technician," featured a cover image of eerily joyful clowns in greasepaint inspired by the costumes of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy), the band attracted an ardent cult following among Gen X ironists and hollow-eyed nihilists (not to mention Kurt Cobain of Nirvana).
As the decade drew to a close, Ms. Taylor left the band after experiencing seizures, which she attributed to the strobe lights the band used onstage. In 1993, she had surgery for a brain aneurysm.
Despite her exit from the band she had made her name with, her biggest taste of fame was yet to come.
In "Slacker," she made a memorable appearance playing an addlebrained opportunist wandering the streets trying to sell a jar from a medical laboratory with purported pop-culture significance. "I know it's kind of cloudy," her character insists, "but it's a Madonna Pap smear."
The film was an artfully ragged series of vignettes about young eccentrics, played largely by nonprofessionals, knocking around Austin. Premiering in the early days of "Seinfeld," it was a movie about nothing that captured the spirit of twentysomethings who, according to the clichés of the day, cared about nothing and aspired to nothing.
With her indelible appearance on the movie's poster and other packaging materials, Ms. Taylor became a face of her generation -- a slack-jawed youth, her skinny arms thrust into her pockets in a gesture both bored and rebellious.
"We talked about doing a drugged-out freak kind of character going on about Madonna," Ms. Taylor said in a 2001 interview with The Austin American-Statesman, recalling her experiences on set. "I had a rock-star attitude and a big ego. I demanded a hat and sunglasses for the scene. I did not want my face to be seen. And it became an image."
Ms. Taylor would go on to work at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired in Austin, according to The Austin Chronicle, and was writing a memoir about her time with the band.
Information about survivors was not immediately available.
As the years rolled by, her rock-star swagger may have faded, but not, it seemed, her sense of irony. "I am the ultimate slacker," she told The American-Statesman. "I'm on disability for depression, I get a check every month and I watch a lot of TV."

Western Allies Pledge Billions Toward the Reconstruction of Ukraine: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The price tag for reconstruction has soared, driving debate among U.S. and European officials, legal experts and others about using frozen Russian assets to pay for it.
Western countries pledged tens of billions of dollars to rebuild war-torn Ukraine on Wednesday, as leaders gathered at a two-day conference convened by the British government in the shadow of Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia.
But with the total cost of reconstruction projected to spiral into the hundreds of billions of dollars, the prospect of using confiscated Russian assets to pay for it emerged as a potent, if problematic, theme at the gathering.
Britain and the European Union are both exploring legal mechanisms to divert frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. Globally, these public and private assets are estimated to be worth at least $ 300 billion, a sizable chunk of the total reconstruction cost, which the World Bank currently estimates at more than $ 411 billion.
While few legal experts question the right of countries to freeze foreign assets, some warn that confiscating a large amount of Russian funds could set a troublesome legal precedent and undermine confidence in financial markets.
The pledges, rolled out by Britain, the United States, and the European Union, sought to shift public attention, at least for the moment, from the battlefield to the yearslong reconstruction of Ukraine that will follow the war.
"It's clear Russia must pay for the destruction it inflicted," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain said in opening the conference.
"As we've seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take it will seek to destroy," Mr. Sunak added. "They want to do the same to Ukraine's economy."
Speaking to the participants by video link, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine argued that there was economic opportunity in the ruins of his country. He thanked the donors but pleaded with them to start investing immediately.
"We must move from vision to agreements, and from agreements to real projects," Mr. Zelensky said.
Britain announced assistance that includes 240 million pounds ( $ 305 million) of direct economic assistance and $ 3 billion in World Bank loan guarantees. The loans are intended to encourage an influx of private investment to rebuild Ukrainian cities and towns destroyed by Russian forces.
The European Union laid out an ambitious package that would include 50 billion euros (about $ 55 billion) from 2024 to 2027. About €17 billion would come in grants, and the rest in the form of low-interest loans. The package must be approved by all 27 members of the bloc, however, and it may face hurdles.
"This plan could become an anchor for all international donors," said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. "This is what I mean when I say we are with Ukraine for as long as it takes."
The United States announced $ 1.3 billion in additional economic aid, roughly split between funds to overhaul Ukraine's heavily damaged energy infrastructure and to modernize ports, railways and border crossings.
"As Russia continues to destroy, we are here to help Ukraine rebuild," said Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, noting that the package had bipartisan support in Congress. "Recovery is about laying the foundation for Ukraine to thrive."
The United States has delivered more than $ 20 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine, Mr. Blinken said, as well as $ 2.1 billion in humanitarian aid. It is also the largest provider of military aid to the Ukrainian military.
Britain, which is also one of Ukraine's largest military suppliers, is leveraging London's status as a global center of finance and insurance to stimulate foreign investment, in part by trying to reduce the risks to investors.
The $ 3 billion in loan guarantees to the World Bank extends over three years, Mr. Sunak said, and is backed by more than 400 companies from 38 countries, including Virgin, Sanofi, Phillips and Hyundai Engineering.
The World Bank's estimate of the reconstruction costs doesn't cover the far-flung damage caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine this month. The price tag is so enormous -- and is rising so rapidly -- that it has renewed calls to confiscate Russian assets to pay for it.
"The Russian assets issue is the elephant in the room at the conference," said Philip D. Zelikow, a historian at the University of Virginia and Stanford University who has written about Ukraine's long-term recovery. "If we don't use Russian assets, we simply won't have nearly enough money to do it."
Mr. Zelikow said reconstruction without Russian assets would require massive state outlays, which will be politically untenable in several countries, not least the United States. But for now, he said, the intense focus on private investment is postponing harder questions about the role of Russian money.
Ukraine's government is already using confiscated Russian assets in its country to pay for rebuilding, according to its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Appearing at the conference Wednesday, he encouraged Western countries to develop legal mechanisms to allow them to confiscate assets frozen in their countries for similar purposes.
"Russia must pay for what it has destroyed," Mr. Shmyhal said.
But the issue remains sensitive. The European Central Bank has privately warned Brussels that confiscating Russian funds or giving the interest earned on those accounts to Ukraine could undermine confidence in the euro and shake financial stability.
If the United States were to do it, some say it would unnerve countries that hold large foreign exchange reserves in dollars. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned last February of "significant legal obstacles" to it.
Britain announced legislation this week that would allow it to leave sanctions in place until Russia pays reparations to its neighbor. Britain has frozen roughly $ 23 billion in assets and imposed sanctions on 1,550 individuals.
"It is absolutely right that we explore all legal paths, both domestically and internationally, to send a message," said James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary. "I'm confident we will unlock the funds necessary to Ukraine's recovery."
But Mr. Cleverly, like other Western officials, sidestepped questions about how, and when, that might be accomplished.
Mr. Zelikow argued there was ample precedent. In a recent essay in Foreign Affairs that he co-wrote with Lawrence H. Summers and Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Zelikow noted that after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, France, Britain, and the United States transferred frozen Iraqi state funds into an international escrow account to pay compensation.
Although fighting is still raging in Ukraine, analysts said it was important to start planning the postwar rebuilding process, to avoid the kind of delays that dogged the reconstruction of Europe after World War II.
"Without any kind of planning, these delays can mount, and they can lead to human misery and to failure of economies and to basically foreign policy failures," Howard Shatz, a senior economist at RAND Corporation, told reporters last week. "So, it is important to start planning now."

Quantum Computing Could Begin a New Era: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Quantum computers today are small in computational scope -- the chip inside your smartphone contains billions of transistors while the most powerful quantum computer contains a few hundred of the quantum equivalent of a transistor. They are also unreliable. If you run the same calculation over and over, they will most likely churn out different answers each time.
But with their intrinsic ability to consider many possibilities at once, quantum computers do not have to be very large to tackle certain prickly problems of computation, and on Wednesday, IBM researchers announced that they had devised a method to manage the unreliability in a way that would lead to reliable, useful answers.
"What IBM showed here is really an amazingly important step in that direction of making progress towards serious quantum algorithmic design," said Dorit Aharonov, a professor of computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who was not involved with the research.
While researchers at Google in 2019 claimed that they had achieved "quantum supremacy" -- a task performed much more quickly on a quantum computer than a conventional one -- IBM's researchers say they have achieved something new and more useful, albeit more modestly named.
"We're entering this phase of quantum computing that I call utility," said Jay Gambetta, a vice president of IBM Quantum. "The era of utility."
A team of IBM scientists who work for Dr. Gambetta described their results in a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Present-day computers are called digital, or classical, because they deal with bits of information that are either 1 or 0, on or off. A quantum computer performs calculations on quantum bits, or qubits, that capture a more complex state of information. Just as a thought experiment by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger postulated that a cat could be in a quantum state that is both dead and alive, a qubit can be both 1 and 0 simultaneously.
That allows quantum computers to make many calculations in one pass, while digital ones have to perform each calculation separately. By speeding up computation, quantum computers could potentially solve big, complex problems in fields like chemistry and materials science that are out of reach today. Quantum computers could also have a darker side by threatening privacy through algorithms that break the protections used for passwords and encrypted communications.
When Google researchers made their supremacy claim in 2019, they said their quantum computer performed a calculation in 3 minutes 20 seconds that would take about 10,000 years on a state-of-the-art conventional supercomputer.
But some other researchers, including those at IBM, discounted the claim, saying the problem was contrived. "Google's experiment, as impressive it was, and it was really impressive, is doing something which is not interesting for any applications," said Dr. Aharonov, who also works as the chief scientific officer of Qedma, a quantum computing company.
The Google computation also turned out to be less impressive than it first appeared. A team of Chinese researchers was able to perform the same calculation on a non-quantum supercomputer in just over five minutes, far quicker than the 10,000 years the Google team had estimated.
The IBM researchers in the new study performed a different task, one that interests physicists. They used a quantum processor with 127 qubits to simulate the behavior of 127 atom-scale bar magnets -- tiny enough to be governed by the spooky rules of quantum mechanics -- in a magnetic field. That is a simple system known as the Ising model, which is often used to study magnetism.
This problem is too complex for a precise answer to be calculated even on the largest, fastest supercomputers.
On the quantum computer, the calculation took less than a thousandth of a second to complete. Each quantum calculation was unreliable -- fluctuations of quantum noise inevitably intrude and induce errors -- but each calculation was quick, so it could be performed repeatedly.
Indeed, for many of the calculations, additional noise was deliberately added, making the answers even more unreliable. But by varying the amount of noise, the researchers could tease out the specific characteristics of the noise and its effects at each step of the calculation.
"We can amplify the noise very precisely, and then we can rerun that same circuit," said Abhinav Kandala, the manager of quantum capabilities and demonstrations at IBM Quantum and an author of the Nature paper. "And once we have results of these different noise levels, we can extrapolate back to what the result would have been in the absence of noise."
In essence, the researchers were able to subtract the effects of noise from the unreliable quantum calculations, a process they call error mitigation.
"You have to bypass that by inventing very clever ways to mitigate the noise," Dr. Aharonov said. "And this is what they do."
Altogether, the computer performed the calculation 600,000 times, converging on an answer for the overall magnetization produced by the 127 bar magnets.
But how good was the answer?
For help, the IBM team turned to physicists at the University of California, Berkeley. Although an Ising model with 127 bar magnets is too big, with far too many possible configurations, to fit in a conventional computer, classical algorithms can produce approximate answers, a technique similar to how compression in JPEG images throws away less crucial data to reduce the size of the file while preserving most of the image's details.
Michael Zaletel, a physics professor at Berkeley and an author of the Nature paper, said that when he started working with IBM, he thought his classical algorithms would do better than the quantum ones.
"It turned out a little bit differently than I expected," Dr. Zaletel said.
Certain configurations of the Ising model can be solved exactly, and both the classical and quantum algorithms agreed on the simpler examples. For more complex but solvable instances, the quantum and classical algorithms produced different answers, and it was the quantum one that was correct.
Thus, for other cases where the quantum and classical calculations diverged and no exact solutions are known, "there is reason to believe that the quantum result is more accurate," said Sajant Anand, a graduate student at Berkeley who did much of the work on the classical approximations.
It is not clear that quantum computing is indisputably the winner over classical techniques for the Ising model.
Mr. Anand is currently trying to add a version of error mitigation for the classical algorithm, and it is possible that could match or surpass the performance of the quantum calculations.
"It's not obvious that they've achieved quantum supremacy here," Dr. Zaletel said.
In the long run, quantum scientists expect that a different approach, error correction, will be able to detect and correct calculation mistakes, and that will open the door for quantum computers to speed ahead for many uses.
Error correction is already used in conventional computers and data transmission to fix garbles. But for quantum computers, error correction is likely years away, requiring better processors able to process many more qubits.
Error mitigation, the IBM scientists believe, is an interim solution that can be used now for increasingly complex problems beyond the Ising model.
"This is one of the simplest natural science problems that exists," Dr. Gambetta said. "So it's a good one to start with. But now the question is, how do you generalize it and go to more interesting natural science problems?"
Those might include figuring out the properties of exotic materials, accelerating drug discovery and modeling fusion reactions.

Full text: The finer details of what happened to the RMS Titanic differ depending on who is telling the story.
The iceberg that collided with the luxury liner was spotted at 11:40 p.m., according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, or 11:35 p.m., which is what an exhibition about the ship in New York claims. The Royal Museums Greenwich in Britain says the doomed vessel cost 1,503 people their lives, while the Smithsonian in the United States claims that 1,522 passengers and crew died.
Historians have attributed the variance to factors like imperfect ticketing lists and rushed head counts transmitted using weak signals. The broad strokes, however, are not in question. All credible experts agree that on April 15, 1912, less than a week into its maiden voyage, the Titanic ended up at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean.
More than a century later, on TikTok, a far different version has been circulating. In a post that garnered more than 11 million views before it was removed earlier this year, one user wrote: "the titanic never sank!!!"
On the short-form video app, long-established facts about the crash are being newly litigated as musty rumors merge with fresh misinformation and manipulated content -- a demonstration of TikTok's potent ability to seed historical revisionism about even the most deeply studied cases.
One 32-second post opens with a dramatic black-and-white drawing of the Titanic, its stern straining above waves studded with people, set to a spooky synthesizer tune. A man in a hoodie and a backward baseball cap, crudely green-screened into the frame, makes a familiar argument (accompanied by an emoji of a screaming face): "The Titanic NEVER actually sank." Looking into the camera, he repeats the so-called and exhaustively disproved "swap" theory -- that the ruins on the seabed belong to the Titanic's older and decrepit sister ship, the Olympic, scuttled in an attempt at insurance fraud.
Another video presents a conspiracy theory that the wreck was a "hit job" ordered by the financier J.P. Morgan -- whose real name was John Pierpont Sr. -- to eliminate opponents of the Federal Reserve.
Titanic skepticism has irritated scholars of the ship since it sank. Then, in December, came the 25th anniversary of the 1997 film "Titanic," the costly and heartthrob-minting epic that laid a swooning romance over a fictionalized depiction of the disaster.
The celebration included a rerelease of the film in theaters just before Valentine's Day. There was also a flurry of news reports about James Cameron, the director, working with scientists and stunt people to resolve a persistent debate about a pivotal scene in the movie, which centered on how many star-crossed lovers could survive on a door floating in freezing ocean water. (Tests showed that two could have, in fact, managed.)
Mr. Cameron's experiments seemed to add fuel to a raft of TikTok conspiracy theories about the actual Titanic -- many of them patched together from a grab bag of suppositions and misinterpreted evidence and posted in quippy online installments.
"It becomes kind of deflating to see a lot of this junk coming out," said Charles A. Haas, a founder of the Titanic International Society who has spent six decades studying the ill-fated vessel. He co-wrote five books on the topic, dived down to the wreck site twice and debunked more conspiracy theories than he cares to count. "I feel like one of the very few voices crying out against the sound of a hurricane."
The Titanic International Society, one of several historical organizations worldwide dedicated to Titanic study, has Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts but no presence on TikTok. Mr. Haas attributed the decision in part to the fear that TikTok's reputation as "kind of a wild and woolly place" would taint any serious research shared on the platform.
"If you have a wonderful piece of filet mignon and you wrap it in smelly fish, the filet mignon after a while doesn't smell so good either," he said.
TikTok is just the latest recycling bin for false narratives about the Titanic, which began circulating almost as soon as the ship had sunk.
A month after the wreck, The Washington Post raised the possibility that the tragedy stemmed from the "ancient malice" of a mummified Egyptian priestess, who cursed an editor after he dared to tell her story to fellow Titanic passengers. Others have tried, unconvincingly, to pin the high death toll on Winston Churchill, a German submarine, sabotage-minded Catholic shipbuilders or decks that could be electromagnetically sealed to prevent passengers below from escaping. The Freemasons were accused of orchestrating a cover-up.
Such conspiracy theories are a fount of deep and familiar exasperation for Mr. Haas, fueled by years of weary disbelief that tall tales about an extensively documented disaster can continue to find audiences through books, so-called documentaries and now, a video app.
"The sad part is that many of the people following this sort of thing are teenagers, and they are woefully unwilling to do digging," he said.
TikTok, which claims to have 150 million American users and is particularly popular with youths, has become an especially powerful vector for misinformation, past and present. A period of violent dictatorship in the Philippines decades ago was recently recast on TikTok as a rosy time of economic growth. A pawnshop owner on the app claimed last year to have an album of previously unseen images of the Rape of Nanjing in 1937, but later said that the disturbing photos, which drew nearly 52 million views, were actually "reproduction souvenirs" from Shanghai.
Like other social media platforms, TikTok has tried to tamp down some harmful historical falsehoods, such as efforts to deny the Holocaust, while working to combat more modern lies about elections, health hacks and other topics. (The company, which is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, has also been fighting for its future in the United States amid national security concerns.)
"Our priority is to protect our community, which is why we remove misinformation that will cause significant harm and work with independent fact checkers to help assess the accuracy of content on our platform," said Ben Rathe, a spokesman for TikTok. According to its guidelines, the company prevents some videos with conspiracy theories from showing up in feeds, like those that claim "covert or powerful groups" carried out events. But the app doesn't block these videos altogether.
While many of the young users on TikTok can recognize and poke fun at conspiracy theories, the generation also struggles with understanding the past. Proficiency in U.S. history among eighth graders has declined every year since 2014, according to one federal gauge. Another poll last year asked whether NASA astronauts had landed on the moon -- nearly half of the participants who were born after 1997 said they had not or that they were unsure.
In a recent survey of young Americans who use TikTok for more than an hour a day, 17 percent "couldn't say definitively that the Earth is round," according to the Reboot Foundation, a Paris-based nonprofit that promotes media literacy and critical thinking.
"Fundamentally, a 14-year-old is probably taught at school that the Earth is round and probably believes it, but with the frequency of watching videos over and over, they start questioning it," said Helen Lee Bouygues, who started the Reboot Foundation to help fight misinformation. She said the group saw that "the longer young adults were on TikTok, the more that they believe what they see."
Misinformation experts say that TikTok's algorithm and the personalized feeds it creates for users can make it particularly powerful for spreading conspiracy theories. To show content to users, the system relies less on social connections and followers, like on Twitter and Facebook, and more on engagement, said Megan Brown, a senior research engineer at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics.
"If someone is spending time on a video, it doesn't matter if they really believe J.P. Morgan sank the Titanic, or if they believe, hey, this is a funny video, someone is talking about J.P. Morgan sinking the Titanic," Ms. Brown said. "This is the same signal as far as TikTok is concerned, so they recommend more of that content."
Mr. Morgan, whose White Star Line owned the Titanic, figures prominently in Titanic lore. TikTok videos repeat decades-old claims that the millionaire backed out of a planned trip on the Titanic minutes or hours before it set sail because he intended to use the ship to assassinate powerful enemies onboard who opposed his efforts to create a centralized banking system. (In some tellings, TikTok creators have recast the villains as the wealthy Rothschild family or even the Catholic order of the Jesuits.)
Experts point out that the historical record and common sense do not support such assertions. Evidence suggests that Mr. Morgan failed to make his date with the Titanic because he was dealing with an unexpected situation involving his European art collection. The businessman would also have had to ensure that the Titanic would strike an iceberg with catastrophic force, and that his opponents were not among the more than 700 people who survived the crash.
Of course, history is not set in stone -- especially when record-keeping was less technologically advanced -- and experts often disagree. Parks Stephenson, a Navy veteran who has visited the wreckage multiple times and advised Mr. Cameron on a 2003 documentary about the ship, conflicts with many fellow Titanic scholars in his belief that the iceberg damaged the ship's bottom rather than its side.
The consensus, though, is this: The Titanic sank in a terrible accident and many people died. Acknowledging the ship's true fate allows the tragedy to become a valuable tool, Mr. Stephenson said: a way to understand communications failures, improvements in safety regulations, oceanic science, underwater forensics and hubris and heroism in times of crisis.
"On a grand scale, the study of history keeps you from repeating the mistakes that were made in the past and, continually, moving forward," said Mr. Stephenson, who is now the executive director of the USS Kidd Veterans Museum.
Titanic conspiracy theories may seem relatively harmless, especially in a modern environment where online lies have enabled real-world harm, such as an attack on the Capitol or a gunman in a pizzeria. Untrue rumors about a 111-year-old shipwreck fall into something of a gap for social media companies, which are already struggling to address contemporary falsehoods with content moderators.
Ms. Brown said that the concern was a longer-term erosion of the truth and the idea that "people who believe in at least one conspiracy theory tend to believe in at least more than one."
Hooking someone with one false narrative makes it easier to snare them with another, she said: "Hey, if you heard this about the Titanic, then you won't believe this other cover-up."
In the absence of TikTok intervention, some users have taken matters into their own hands.
Rafael Avila, 33, a tech consultant for IBM, is known in his spare time as "Titanic Guy" on TikTok, where he has amassed more than 600,000 followers since 2020 and frequently posts videos debunking conspiracy theories about the shipwreck.
"These theories have always been around inside the Titanic community, but they've sort of been on the fringe," said Mr. Avila, who lives in Toronto and has been obsessed with the Titanic since childhood. TikTok changed that, he said. "When the first couple of videos were made about the Olympic theory, the Federal Reserve theory, the algorithm picked up on that, seeing that people were engaging with that, and then it started exploding."
While Mr. Avila had joined the app to share his passion for the Titanic story, he quickly added debunking videos to his repertoire, using TikTok's easy-to-use editing tools -- like the ability to "stitch" or "duet" videos that promote bogus ideas to fact-check them. Now, his followers often tag him whenever a Titanic conspiracy theory video goes viral, so he can roll up his sleeves and film the facts. The TikTok videos with the truth don't receive as many views as the intrigue-filled conspiracy theories, but they can still attract millions of eyeballs, he said.
"My community of Titanic nerds look to me to correct the record, so I've taken it on as my responsibility," he said. "It's the internet, people can say whatever they want."

Silicon Valley Has a New Style Star: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jensen Huang, the C.E.O. of Nvidia, is transforming a black leather jacket into a symbol of the A.I. paradigm shift.
There's a new tech titan in town and he's preparing to enter the pantheon. How do we know?
Well, Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, has the company: He co-founded Nvidia in 1993, and the market cap is now about $ 950 billion, though at the end of May it was briefly in the $ 1 trillion club, putting it in a similar league to Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.
He has the product: a data processing chip that is key to A.I. development, which is to say, the life of ChatGPT and Bard, which is to say, the current paradigm shift.
And he has the look: a black leather jacket he wears every time he is in the public eye, most often with a black T-shirt and black jeans.
Mr. Huang wore a black leather jacket when he was on the cover of Time as one of its men of the year in 2021. A black leather jacket during his keynote speeches at multiple GTC developer conferences since 2018. To deliver the 2023 World ITF keynote and the 2023 Computex 2023 keynote. He even identified himself, back in a Reddit AMA in 2016, as "the guy in the leather jacket."
Sometimes his leather jackets have collars, sometimes they look more like motorcycle jackets; sometime a lot of zips are involved, sometimes not. But the jackets are always black. He has been wearing them, a spokesman said, "for at least 20 years." The point is that he always looks the same.
There hasn't been a popularly identifiable face of A.I. yet. ChatGPT and Bard are anonymous brains. That's part of what makes A.I. so eerie -- its disembodied nature. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, is ubiquitous, but looks kind of generic. Mr. Huang and his leather jacket are poised to step neatly into that gap.
The jacket is an object that has become a signifier -- of a person but also the great leap forward that person represents. And that association puts Mr. Huang in the same club as Steve "black turtleneck" Jobs, Mark "gray T-shirt" Zuckerberg and Jeff "Pitbull" Bezos as a chief executive who understands that the difference between a company that is a world-changing success and a company that is a world-changing success that becomes a part of pop culture may be the image of its figurehead. One that's just enough of a caricature to work its way into the public imagination and become the avatar of a movement.
"It makes a person instantly recognizable, sort of like a cartoon character or superhero," said Richard Thompson Ford, the author of "Dress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History" and a professor at Stanford Law School. It signals "a down-to-earth rejection of fashionable artifice, while still using the power of fashion."
Not that the people involved would put it that way exactly.
Power Uniforms (or the Power of Uniforms)
When asked why they wear the same thing day in and day out, most powerful people who are willing to address the question say it saves time, allowing them to think about whatever pressing issue is at hand, not about what they are going to wear that day.
This is what Barack Obama, who copped to wearing only gray or dark blue suits as president, aside from that one unfortunate tan suit moment, said, as did Mr. Zuckerberg. According to Mr. Huang's spokesman, "he's said before that he dresses in the same style of black pants and shirt because it presents one fewer set of decisions to be made each day." (Mr. Huang himself was "taking a break from speaking to the media," the spokesman said. )
That's unquestionably true. Wearing the same uniform every day also communicates discipline (no flights of fashion here), focus and, Mr. Ford said, "reliability" -- all qualities that are desirable in any chief executive.
But to think that's all that this is about is to miss part of the picture. Anyone with aspirations to global domination, especially in the era of visual communication, would know enough about history to know that.
After all, wearing the same thing every day is a shortcut to crafting a Pavlovian identity in the hive mind -- not just in Silicon Valley but in pretty much any arena. When you think of magazine editors, for example, who comes to mind? Anna Wintour, with her severe bob and dark glasses. When you think of the Supreme Court? Black robes (and maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg's lace collar).
History is littered with figures who understood the power of a consistent visual signature -- so much so that they often had garment styles named after them. Nelson Mandela had the Madiba shirt; Narendra Modi, the Modi Kurta; Jawaharlal Nehru, the Nehru jacket. These associations become impossible to forget, embedded deep in our cerebral cortex, shaping assumptions and opinions. See Elizabeth Holmes and her black turtleneck, which, with its direct link to Steve Jobs, implied brilliance to the watching world, whether we were aware of it or not.
And when it comes to cultural associations, there are few garments as rich in adjectives as a black leather jacket. It is effectively a personality ready-made -- as Mr. Huang is clearly aware.
According to one observer, when the Nvidia chief was walking around Computex in Taipei last month in his leather jacket, he was asked how he could stand the heat. (The temperature on the day of his keynote was between 79 and 90 degrees.)
"I'm always cool," Mr. Huang responded.
The Man in Black
The black leather jacket "connects 1950s Hollywood to a sense of independence, the open road, rebellion and sex appeal," said Joseph Rosenfeld, an image consultant and stylist in Silicon Valley.
It is the uniform of Marlon Brando in "The Wild One" and James Dean in photos almost everywhere. Of the Beats and the Beatles; Elvis and David Bowie (in his Berlin period). It is the opposite of what we think of when we think of a tech nerd, which is why the fact that Mr. Huang chose it as his uniform was so smart. It stands out. It causes a reassessment.
Especially on a 60-year-old man like Mr. Huang. Imagine "if Huang were wearing a suit or even a polo shirt and khakis," Mr. Ford said. "He would look like a boring, conventional middle manager." Instead, he said, the leather jacket "signals that he's a creative type and a high status person who can wear whatever he wants."
When I asked ChatGPT, "Why does Jensen Huang wear the same black leather jacket all the time?" it responded with four options, including the suggestion that "Leather jackets, particularly black ones, are often associated with a sense of confidence, authority and professionalism." Also motorcycles, which are about speed.
The jacket also connects to a founding myth of Silicon Valley and Mr. Jobs, the man who was the antithesis of the men in gray suits at IBM, and "almost a spiritual leader for some," as Mr. Ford said. Someone, he said, "who represents a sort of golden age, when everything seemed possible and people still thought tech would be a force for good in the world" -- a particularly salient reminder at a time when the public conversation is centered in part on the potential threat of A.I.
And the jacket strategy is adding up. According to Mr. Rosenfeld, "Clients have asked me about the leather jacket, wanting to know if they can wear the same." (He said he told them Mr. Huang already owned the look and advised that they develop another signature.)
For those who want to know what brand Mr. Huang wears, his spokesman said he did not know. Unlike Mr. Jobs, who owned many versions of the same Issey Miyake turtleneck (or Mr. Zuckerberg, who wears Brunello Cucinelli T-shirts), Mr. Huang appears to vary his jackets. But Mr. Rosenfeld guessed that "they don't appear to be Tom Ford level, which we know he could well afford. At least some that I've seen look to be Theory."
For those who want to get the look, however, at least seven different e-tailers currently offer "Jensen Huang leather jackets" at prices from $ 109 (Jacketpop) to $ 149.99 (the Genuine Leather).
To put this in context, Superstar Jacket sells two versions of a "Jensen Huang leather jacket," alongside a "Fast & Furious 10 Vin Diesel jacket," a "Snoop Dogg leather jacket" and an "Indiana Jones leather jacket."
But Mr. Huang is the only C.E.O. to have a jacket named after him.

A.I. Leader Is Courting Washington: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chief executive of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, has met with at least 100 U.S. lawmakers in recent months. He has also taken his show abroad.
Weeks after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot last year, Sam Altman, the chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up, launched a lobbying blitz in Washington.
He demonstrated ChatGPT at a breakfast with more than 20 lawmakers in the Capitol. He called for A.I. to be regulated in private meetings with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders. In all, Mr. Altman has discussed the rapidly evolving technology with at least 100 members of Congress, as well as with Vice President Kamala Harris and cabinet members at the White House, according to lawmakers and the Biden administration.
"It's so refreshing," said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and the chair of a panel that held an A.I. hearing last month featuring Mr. Altman. "He was willing, able and eager."
Technology chief executives have typically avoided the spotlight of government regulators and lawmakers. It took threats of subpoenas and public humiliation to persuade Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google to testify before Congress in recent years.
But Mr. Altman, 38, has run toward the spotlight, seeking the attention of lawmakers in a way that has thawed icy attitudes toward Silicon Valley companies. He has initiated meetings and jumped at the opportunity to testify in last month's Senate hearing. And instead of protesting regulations, he has invited lawmakers to impose sweeping rules to hold the technology to account.
Mr. Altman has also taken his show on the road, delivering a similar message about A.I. on a 17-city tour of South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. In recent weeks, he has met with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.
"We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models," Mr. Altman said in last month's Senate hearing.
His charm offensive has put him in an important seat of influence. By engaging with lawmakers early, Mr. Altman is shaping the debate on governing A.I. and educating Washington on the complexities of the technology, especially as fears of it grow. Taking a page out of recent history, he is also working to sidestep the pitfalls that befell social media companies, which are a constant target of lawmakers, and to pave the way for A.I.
His actions may help cement OpenAI's position at the forefront of a debate on A.I. regulation. Microsoft, Google, IBM and A.I. start-ups have drawn battle lines on proposed rules and differ on how much government interference they want in their industry. The fissures have led other tech chiefs to plead their cases with the Biden administration, members of Congress and global regulators.
So far, Mr. Altman's strategy appears to be working. U.S. lawmakers have turned to him as an educator and adviser. Last month, he gave a briefing on ChatGPT to dozens of members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House A.I. caucus. He has proposed the creation of an independent regulatory agency for A.I., licensing of the technology and safety standards.
"I have a lot of respect for Sam," said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who hosted Mr. Altman for dinner with more than a dozen other senators last month.
But how long such good will can last is uncertain. Some lawmakers cautioned against becoming overly reliant on Mr. Altman and other tech leaders to educate them on the explosion of new A.I. technologies.
"He does seem different, and it was nice for him to testify," said Senator Josh Hawley, the ranking Republican in the Senate hearing. "But I don't think we ought to be too laudatory of his company just yet."
OpenAI said that with the benefit of learning from the tech industry's past mistakes, it wanted to bridge the knowledge gap between Silicon Valley and Washington on A.I. and help shape regulations.
"We don't want this to be like previous technological revolutions," said Anna Makanju, OpenAI's head of public policy, who leads a small team of five policy experts. Mr. Altman, she said, "knows that this is an important period, so he tries to say yes to as many of these kinds of meetings as possible."
Mr. Altman has been sounding the alarm over A.I.'s potential risks for years while also talking up the technology. In 2015, while leading the start-up incubator Y Combinator, he co-founded OpenAI with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and others. He wrote in a blog post at the time that governments should regulate the most powerful tools of A.I.
"In an ideal world, regulation would slow down the bad guys and speed up the good guys," he wrote.
Mr. Altman has long held the view that it is better to engage early with regulators, Ms. Makanju said.
In 2018, when OpenAI published a statement on its mission, it promised to put a priority on safety, which implied the involvement of regulators, Ms. Makanju said. In 2021, when the company released DALL-E, an A.I. tool that creates images from text commands, the company sent its chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, to showcase the technology for lawmakers.
In January, Mr. Altman traveled to Washington to speak at an off-the-record breakfast with members of Congress organized by the Aspen Institute. He answered questions and previewed GPT-4, OpenAI's new A.I. engine, which he said was built with better security features.
Mr. Altman has surprised some lawmakers with his candor about A.I.'s risks. In a meeting with Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, at OpenAI's San Francisco offices in March, Mr. Altman said A.I. could have a devastating effect on labor, reducing the workweek from five days to one.
"He's very direct," said Mr. Lieu, who holds a degree in computer science.
Mr. Altman visited Washington again in early May for a White House meeting with Ms. Harris and the chief executives of Microsoft, Google and the A.I. start-up Anthropic. During the trip, he also discussed regulatory ideas and concerns about China's development of A.I. with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader.
In mid-May, Mr. Altman returned for a two-day marathon of public and private appearances with lawmakers, starting with a dinner hosted by Mr. Lieu and Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, with 60 House members at the Capitol. Over a buffet of roast chicken, potatoes and salad, he wowed the crowd for two and a half hours by showing ChatGPT and answering questions.
"Write a bill about naming a post office after Representative Ted Lieu," he typed into the ChatGPT prompt that appeared on a big screen, according to Mr. Lieu. "Write a speech for Representative Mike Johnson introducing the bill," he wrote as a second prompt.
The answers were convincing, Mr. Lieu said, and elicited chuckles and raised eyebrows from the audience.
The next morning, Mr. Altman testified at the Senate hearing about A.I.'s risks. He presented a list of regulatory ideas and supported proposals by lawmakers, including Mr. Blumenthal's idea of consumer risk labels on A.I. tools that would be akin to nutrition labels for food.
"I'm so used to witnesses coming in and trying to persuade us with talking points," Mr. Blumenthal said. "The difference with Sam Altman is that he is having a conversation."
After the hearing, which lasted three hours, Mr. Altman briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee on A.I.'s security risks. That evening, he spoke at Mr. Warner's dinner at the Harvest Tide Steakhouse on Capitol Hill. (Mr. Altman is vegetarian.)
He has also benefited from a partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in the start-up. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said he and Mr. Altman provided each other feedback on drafts of memos and blog posts. The companies also coordinated messaging ahead of the White House meeting, Mr. Smith said.
"Any day that we can actually support each other is a good day because we're trying to do something together," he said.
Some researchers and competitors said OpenAI had too much influence over debates on A.I. regulations. Mr. Altman's proposals on licensing and testing could benefit more established A.I. companies like his, said Marietje Schaake, a fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford and a former member of the European Parliament.
"He's not only an expert, he's a stakeholder," Ms. Schaake said.

WASHINGTON — Weeks after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot last year, Sam Altman, the CEO of the artificial intelligence startup, launched a lobbying blitz in Washington.
He demonstrated ChatGPT at a breakfast with more than 20 lawmakers in the Capitol. He called for AI to be regulated in private meetings with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders. In all, Altman has discussed the rapidly evolving technology with at least 100 members of Congress, as well as with Vice President Kamala Harris and Cabinet members at the White House, according to lawmakers and the Biden administration.
“It’s so refreshing,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is also the chair of a panel that held an AI hearing last month featuring Altman. “He was willing, able and eager.”
Technology chief executives have typically avoided the spotlight of government regulators and lawmakers. It took threats of subpoenas and public humiliation to persuade Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google to testify before Congress in recent years.
But Altman, 38, has run toward the spotlight, seeking the attention of lawmakers in a way that has thawed icy attitudes toward Silicon Valley companies. He has initiated meetings and jumped at the opportunity to testify in last month’s Senate hearing. And instead of protesting regulations, he has invited lawmakers to impose sweeping rules to hold the technology to account.
Altman has also taken his show on the road, delivering a similar message about AI on a 17-city tour of South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. In recent weeks, he has met with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.
“We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” Altman said in last month’s Senate hearing.
His charm offensive has put him in an important seat of influence. By engaging with lawmakers early, Altman is shaping the debate on governing AI and educating Washington on the complexities of the technology, especially as fears of it grow. Taking a page out of recent history, he is also working to sidestep the pitfalls that befell social media companies, which are a constant target of lawmakers, and to pave the way for AI.
His actions may help cement OpenAI’s position at the forefront of a debate on AI regulation. Microsoft, Google, IBM and AI startups have drawn battle lines on proposed rules and differ on how much government interference they want in their industry. The fissures have led other tech chiefs to plead their cases with the Biden administration, members of Congress and global regulators.
So far, Altman’s strategy appears to be working. U.S. lawmakers have turned to him as an educator and adviser. Last month, he gave a briefing on ChatGPT to dozens of members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House AI caucus. He has proposed the creation of an independent regulatory agency for AI, licensing of the technology and safety standards.
“I have a lot of respect for Sam,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who hosted Altman for dinner with more than a dozen other senators last month.
But how long such good will can last is uncertain. Some lawmakers cautioned against becoming overly reliant on Altman and other tech leaders to educate them on the explosion of new AI technologies.
“He does seem different, and it was nice for him to testify,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, the ranking Republican in the Senate hearing. “But I don’t think we ought to be too laudatory of his company just yet.”
OpenAI said that with the benefit of learning from the tech industry’s past mistakes, it wanted to bridge the knowledge gap between Silicon Valley and Washington on AI and help shape regulations.
“We don’t want this to be like previous technological revolutions,” said Anna Makanju, OpenAI’s head of public policy, who leads a small team of five policy experts. Altman, she said, “knows that this is an important period, so he tries to say yes to as many of these kinds of meetings as possible.”
Altman has been sounding the alarm over AI’s potential risks for years while also talking up the technology. In 2015, while leading the startup incubator Y Combinator, he co-founded OpenAI with Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, and others. He wrote in a blog post at the time that governments should regulate the most powerful tools of AI.
“In an ideal world, regulation would slow down the bad guys and speed up the good guys,” he wrote.
Altman has long held the view that it is better to engage early with regulators, Makanju said.
In 2018, when OpenAI published a statement on its mission, it promised to put a priority on safety, which implied the involvement of regulators, Makanju said. In 2021, when the company released DALL-E, an AI tool that creates images from text commands, the company sent its chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, to showcase the technology for lawmakers.
In January, Altman traveled to Washington to speak at an off-the-record breakfast with members of Congress organized by the Aspen Institute. He answered questions and previewed GPT-4, OpenAI’s new AI engine, which he said was built with better security features.
Altman has surprised some lawmakers with his candor about AI’s risks. In a meeting with Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., at OpenAI’s San Francisco offices in March, Altman said AI could have a devastating effect on labor, reducing the workweek from five days to one.
“He’s very direct,” said Lieu, who holds a degree in computer science.
Altman visited Washington again in early May for a White House meeting with Harris and the CEOs of Microsoft, Google and the AI startup Anthropic. During the trip, he also discussed regulatory ideas and concerns about China’s development of AI with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader.
In mid-May, Altman returned for a two-day marathon of public and private appearances with lawmakers, starting with a dinner hosted by Lieu and Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., with 60 House members at the Capitol. Over a buffet of roast chicken, potatoes and salad, he wowed the crowd for 2 1/2 hours by showing ChatGPT and answering questions.
“Write a bill about naming a post office after Representative Ted Lieu,” he typed into the ChatGPT prompt that appeared on a big screen, according to Lieu. “Write a speech for Representative Mike Johnson introducing the bill,” he wrote as a second prompt.
The answers were convincing, Lieu said, and elicited chuckles and raised eyebrows from the audience.
The next morning, Altman testified at the Senate hearing about AI’s risks. He presented a list of regulatory ideas and supported proposals by lawmakers, including Blumenthal’s idea of consumer risk labels on AI tools that would be akin to nutrition labels for food.
“I’m so used to witnesses coming in and trying to persuade us with talking points,” Blumenthal said. “The difference with Sam Altman is that he is having a conversation.”
After the hearing, which lasted three hours, Altman briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee on AI’s security risks. That evening, he spoke at Warner’s dinner at the Harvest Tide Steakhouse on Capitol Hill. (Altman is vegetarian.)
He has also benefited from a partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in the startup. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said he and Altman provided each other feedback on drafts of memos and blog posts. The companies also coordinated messaging ahead of the White House meeting, Smith said.

Altman’s proposals on licensing and testing could benefit more established AI companies like his, said Marietje Schaake, a fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford and a former member of the European Parliament.
“He’s not only an expert, he’s a stakeholder,” Schaake said.

Fears About A.I. Could Be Warranted, or Not: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The tally of how many jobs will be "affected by" world-changing technology is different depending on who you ask.
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University published a startling number about the future of work: 47 percent of all United States jobs, they estimated, were "at risk" of automation "over some unspecified number of years, perhaps a decade or two."
But a decade later, unemployment in the country is at record low levels. The tsunami of grim headlines back then -- like "The Rich and Their Robots Are About to Make Half the World's Jobs Disappear" -- look wildly off the mark.
But the study's authors say they didn't actually mean to suggest doomsday was near. Instead, they were trying to describe what technology was capable of.
It was the first stab at what has become a long-running thought experiment, with think tanks, corporate research groups and economists publishing paper after paper to pinpoint how much work is "affected by" or "exposed to" technology.
In other words: If cost of the tools weren't a factor, and the only goal was to automate as much human labor as possible, how much work could technology take over?
When the Oxford researchers, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne, were conducting their study, IBM Watson, a question-answering system powered by artificial intelligence, had just shocked the world by winning "Jeopardy!" Test versions of autonomous vehicles were circling roads for the first time. Now, a new wave of studies follows the rise of tools that use generative A.I.
In March, Goldman Sachs estimated that the technology behind popular A.I. tools such as DALL-E and ChatGPT could automate the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. Researchers at Open AI, the maker of those tools, and the University of Pennsylvania found that 80 percent of the U.S. work force could see an effect on at least 10 percent of their tasks.
"There's tremendous uncertainty," said David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been studying technological change and the labor market for more than 20 years. "And people want to provide those answers."
But what exactly does it mean to say that, for instance, the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs could be affected by A. I.?
It depends, Mr. Autor said. "Affected could mean made better, made worse, disappeared, doubled."
One complicating factor is that technology tends to automate tasks, not entire occupations. In 2016, for instance, the artificial intelligence pioneer Geoffrey Hinton considered new "deep learning" technology capable of reading medical images. He concluded that "if you work as a radiologist, you are like the coyote that's already over the edge of the cliff but hasn't yet looked down."
He gave it five years, maybe ten, before algorithms would "do better" than humans. What he probably overlooked was that reading the images is just one of many tasks (30 of them, according to the U.S. government) that radiologists do. They also do things like "confer with medical professionals" and "provide counseling." Today, some in the field worry about an impending shortage of radiologists. And Mr. Hinton has since become a vocal public critic of the same technology he helped create.
Mr. Frey and Mr. Osborne calculated their 47 percent number in part by asking technology experts to rate how likely entire occupations like "telemarketer" or "accountant" were to be automated. But three years after their paper published, a group of researchers at the ZEW Center for European Economic Research, based in Mannheim, Germany, published a similar study that assessed tasks -- like "explain products or services" -- and found that just 9 percent of occupations across 21 countries could be automated.
"People like numbers," said Melanie Arntz, the lead author of the ZEW paper. "People always think that the number must be somehow solid, you know, because it's a number. But numbers can really be very misleading."
In some scenarios, A.I. has essentially created a tool, not a full job replacement. You're now a digger who can use an excavator instead of a shovel. Or a nurse practitioner with access to better information for diagnosing a patient. It's possible that you should charge more per hour, because you're going to get a lot more done.
In other scenarios, the technology is replacing your labor rather complementing it. Or turning your job from one that requires special skills to one that doesn't. That is not likely to go well for you.
In either case, says Mr. Autor, technological developments throughout history have tended to mostly affect wages and wealth distribution -- not how many jobs are available. "This kind of exercise risks missing the forest by focusing on one very prominent tree," he said of studies that look at how much human work could be replaced by A.I.
What he considers to be another key focus -- how artificial intelligence will change the value of skills -- is difficult to predict, because the answer depends partly on how new tools are designed, regulated and used.
Take customer service. Many companies have handed the task of answering phones to an automated decision tree, bringing in the human operator only to troubleshoot. But one Fortune 500 enterprise software company has approached the problem differently. It created a generative A.I. tool to provide the agents with suggestions for what to say -- keeping humans, and their ability to read social cues, in the loop. When researchers at Stanford and M.I.T. compared the performance of groups who were given the tool with those who weren't, they found the tool significantly improved the performance of lower-skilled agents.
Even if a job becomes completely automated, how displaced workers fare will depend on how companies decide to use technology in new kinds of work, especially work we can't yet imagine, said Daron Acemoglu, a professor at M.I.T. and an author of "Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity." These choices will include whether to automate work entirely or use technology to augment human expertise.
He said that the seemingly scary numbers predicting how many jobs A.I. could eliminate, even if it's not clear how, were a "wake up call."
He believes that people could "steer in a better direction," he said, but he is not optimistic. He does not think we are on a "pro-human" path.
All estimates for how much work A.I. could take over are very dependent on humans: the researchers making the assumptions about what technology can do. Mr. Frey and Mr. Osborne invited experts to a workshop to score the likelihood of occupations becoming automated. More recent studies rely on information such as a database tracking A.I. capabilities, created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group. Or they rely on workers using platforms like CrowdFlower, where people complete small tasks for money. The workers score tasks on factors that make them prone to automation. For instance, if it's something with a high tolerance for error, it's a better candidate for a technology like ChatGPT to automate.
The exact numbers are not the point, say many researchers involved in this type of analysis.
"I would describe our methodology as almost certainly precisely wrong, but hopefully directionally correct," said Michael Chui, an A.I. expert at McKinsey who co-authored a 2017 white paper suggesting that about half of work, and 5 percent of occupations, could be automated.
What the data describes is, in some ways, more mundane than often assumed: Big changes are coming, and it's worth paying attention.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, the authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Mr. Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that the accused killer had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took over six weeks -- weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the murders. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as "targeted" and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, the authorities eventually backtracked.
"We cannot say that there is no threat to the community," the police chief, James Fry, said at a news conference on Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the F.B.I. to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home's back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners' addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 the police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Mr. Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a Ph.D. in criminology.
They checked Mr. Kohberger's car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Ms. Goncalves's car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims' house from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims' bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on U.P.S. delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Ms. Goncalves's account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account-holders, including their locations, credit card information and any "private images, pictures or videos" associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 different people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"You couldn't get one warrant to search 19 houses," he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area -- including one in Idaho and two in Washington State -- while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Mr. Kohberger's name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for bread crumbs.
"You could say this is uncharted territory," Mr. Kerr said. "They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there."
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the F.B.I.'s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites' data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
"That is why the Idaho case is so interesting," she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
F.B.I. personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university eight miles from the murder scene.
Mr. Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by the police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Mr. Kohberger's cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps turned off -- in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Mr. Kohberger's family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against their original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whoever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Mr. Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30.
"We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe," the police chief, Mr. Fry, announced. "But we still do need to be vigilant, right?"

MOSCOW, Idaho — In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a doctorate student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that Kohberger had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took more than six weeks — weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the killings. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as “targeted” and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, authorities eventually backtracked.
“We cannot say that there is no threat to the community,” police Chief James Fry said at a news conference Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the FBI to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home’s back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners’ addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a doctorate in criminology.
They checked Kohberger’s car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Goncalves’ car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims’ house from 3 to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims’ bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on UPS delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Goncalves’ account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account holders, including their locations, credit card information and any “private images, pictures or videos” associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“You couldn’t get one warrant to search 19 houses,” he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area — including one in Idaho and two in Washington state — while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Kohberger’s name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for breadcrumbs.
“You could say this is uncharted territory,” Kerr said. “They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there.”
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the FBI’s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites’ data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
“That is why the Idaho case is so interesting,” she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
FBI personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university 8 miles from the scene of the killings.
Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Kohberger’s cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks — perhaps turned off — in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Kohberger’s family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against the original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whomever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30.
“We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe,” the police chief, Fry, announced. “But we still do need to be vigilant, right?”

How a Novel About Video Games Became a Surprise Bestseller

Five and a half years ago, Gabrielle Zevin was in a slump. She had recently published her ninth novel, and sales were sluggish.
She needed a distraction, so she turned, as she often does, to video games. But when she tried to play the adventure game Gold Rush, she discovered that the version she had played obsessively as a kid no longer existed. It felt like a chapter of her childhood had been erased. “This part of my life was gone,” she said.
The feeling of loss yielded a kernel of an idea, which Zevin jotted in a notebook: “Story of two game designers. The games they make are their lives."
Those two sentences eventually grew into her latest novel, “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,” which follows two video game developers who endure creative highs and lows that parallel Zevin’s own meandering path as a novelist.
Zevin had initially figured that there wouldn’t be much of an audience for a literary novel set in the world of game development. So she was elated last summer when the novel became a word-of-mouth phenomenon, fueled by passionate independent booksellers, book clubs and zealous fans posting on social media.
Even more surprising than the novel’s breakout success is its staying power. “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,” which came out in July, has remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 33 weeks and sold more than 1 million copies globally. So far this year, it has sold some 575,000 copies in the United States, outpacing last year’s sales of 300,000. It has racked up around 175,000 five-star ratings on Goodreads and roughly 28,000 on Amazon. It is currently the No. 3 bestselling adult hardcover fiction title of 2023, according to Circana BookScan.
The relentless buzz has put Zevin in an odd position as a midcareer novelist. Even though “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” is not her first book, or even her first to be a bestseller, many readers are coming to her work for the first time. (Oprah Daily mistakenly called it “one of the year’s most ingenious debuts.”)
“When someone has a breakout moment like this, people are always like, ‘Oh, you appeared out of nowhere’,” said novelist Celeste Ng, who praised the book as “a page turner but also, really, this technical marvel.”
“She didn’t come out of nowhere,” Ng said.
Zevin has been publishing at a frenetic pace for nearly two decades, and yet she has rarely repeated herself. Since her debut in 2005, she has written a family drama about war and capitalism, a futuristic dystopian series for young adults, a fablelike YA novel about the afterlife, a quirky novel about a cranky bookseller who unexpectedly finds love and a bitingly funny one about politics, sexism and the double standards women face for sexual indiscretions.
“She has had it all in her career, she’s had a global smash, but she’s also had books that absolutely failed to connect for whatever reason,” said Emma Straub, a novelist and an owner of the independent New York City store Books Are Magic, where “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” has been the top-selling title this year. “For those of us on the backside of 40 who have half a dozen books under our belts, this is so beautiful to watch. She is operating at the height of her powers, and people are noticing.”
Growing up in Boca Raton, Florida, where both of her parents worked for IBM, Zevin was lonely most of the time. The only child of a Korean American mother and a Jewish father, she often felt culturally adrift and out of place. One day, her father, a programmer, brought home a computer loaded with games, including Alley Cat, in which the player is a mischievous cat who jumps through windows into different apartments. “I remember thinking that the game solved a very particular problem for me, which was the problem of solitude,” she said. “It became like an instant friend.”
From there, she discovered games such as King’s Quest IV and Oregon Trail, which felt like immersive worlds she could disappear into. “These were really formative stories for me,” she said.
She majored in English at Harvard University, where she met her partner, director Hans Canosa. After graduating, they moved to New York. Zevin worked furiously on film scripts and plays. One day, she had an idea that didn’t seem right for any of those formats. It became her novel “Elsewhere,” about a teenage girl who dies in a bike accident and wakes up in an afterlife where people age backward until they are reborn. Around the same time, she had the idea for “Margarettown,” a surreal novel about a young man whose love for a woman named Margaret draws him into an alternate world.
Both novels were published in 2005, when Zevin was 27, but they had wildly different trajectories. Critics praised “Margarettown,” which Miramax Books published as an adult novel, but it failed commercially, selling around 4,200 print copies, according to Circana BookScan. “Elsewhere,” a young adult novel that Farrar, Straus and Giroux released several months later, went on to sell more than 350,000 copies.
Over the next eight years, Zevin wrote at a frenetic pace. She published another young-adult novel and a futuristic YA trilogy, and she spent years working on another literary novel, “The Hole We’re In,” about a family struggling with financial debt. But nothing matched the commercial success of “Elsewhere.”
Then, in 2014, Zevin released “The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry,” a love letter to literary culture that centers on an ornery bookstore owner with narrow taste whose horizons are expanded when he falls in love. For reasons that still mystify Zevin, it became a global blockbuster, selling more than 850,000 copies in the United States and more than 4 million worldwide. It was adapted into a feature film in 2022 that was based on a screenplay Zevin wrote, with Canosa, her partner, as the director.
Again, it seemed like Zevin’s breakout moment, and again, success proved fleeting. Three years later, when she published “Young Jane Young,” about a congressional intern who is publicly shamed for having an affair with her boss, it drew strong reviews but sold fewer than 10,000 hardcover copies.
Zevin wallowed for a bit, unsure of what to do next. When she had the idea for a novel about game designers in late 2017, she worried that she wouldn’t be able to pull it off. Even though she had played video games all her life, she knew next to nothing about how they were made.
“It seemed that the subject was so vast, and I knew that if it were to work, it would have to be probably better than anything I had done before,” she said.
She spent years researching the novel, which spans some three decades in the lives of Sam and Sadie. They bond over video games as children and then build a successful company together, making increasingly sophisticated games as technology improves.
Zevin read books about gaming culture and design and watched gamers on YouTube and the livestreaming service Twitch. She played old video games like the original Super Mario Bros. and newer ones that she wouldn’t normally be drawn to, like first-person shooter games, and immersed herself in cinematic-quality ones like The Last of Us. During the hours she spent playing, she was often struck by the games’ narrative complexity and ability to conjure empathy.
A few times, Zevin almost abandoned the book, worried that the subject wouldn’t resonate with a wide audience.
When her literary agent, Douglas Stewart, sent out the manuscript in January 2021, he felt in some ways as if he were introducing her for the first time. “Despite the fact that Gabrielle had several big successes before, there are people who had never heard of her before this,” he said.
A frenzied bidding war with 10 publishers broke out, and Knopf won, paying a seven-figure advance. Shortly after, an auction for screen rights drew 25 bidders, and Paramount Pictures bought them for $2 million. Foreign rights sold in 37 territories. Zevin went on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon.
The novel landed on the New York Times bestseller list at No. 3 in July and stayed for eight weeks before dropping off. Then, in December, critics’ best-of-2022 lists gave the novel a second life, and it sailed back onto the bestseller lists. Knopf, which initially printed 60,000 copies, has reprinted the book 21 times to keep up with runaway sales. This spring, big stores like Walmart and Target, as well as some grocery chains, started carrying it for the first time.
Zevin, who lives in Los Angeles with Canosa and their dogs, Frank, a pug mix, and Leia, a dachshund mix, is writing the screenplay for “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,” a project that presents new narrative challenges.
Looking back, Zevin said she felt fortunate that she was able to carve such an eclectic path, without confining herself to a particular niche.
“I’ve had enough successes,” she said, “to balance out the failures over the years.”

Hyundai Plans Georgia Plant Along With LG: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The facility is the second battery project under development in the state by Hyundai Motor Group and may bring 3,000 jobs.
Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solutions announced plans on Thursday to build a $ 4.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, the latest clean energy facility to come to the state.
The project is expected to bring 3,000 new jobs to southeast Georgia by the end of 2025. It is the second battery manufacturing plant that Hyundai is developing in the state, which has used incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act to open new facilities. Hyundai announced in December that it had teamed up with SK On, a South Korean electric vehicle battery developer, to build a plant in Bartow County.
"Hyundai Motor Group is focusing on its electrification efforts to secure a leadership position in the global auto industry," Jaehoon Chang, president and chief executive of Hyundai Motor Company, said in a statement.
The facility is planned for Bryan County, Ga., near the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, which is under construction, the company said. The Metaplant facility will produce Hyundai, Genesis and Kia electric vehicles.
Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, said in an interview that incentives for clean energy manufacturing in the Inflation Reduction Act made the plant possible.
"This is yet another huge win for Georgia," he said.
In April, Mr. Ossoff led a trade mission to South Korea, where he met with senior executives from both companies.
The announcement followed a decision in January by Hanwha QCells to tap the federal climate and tax measure to expand its operations with a $ 2.5 billion Georgia facility that will produce solar panels and their components.

Full text: MAKENI, Sierra Leone -- Any exasperated parent might be forgiven for wanting a daughter like Alimatu Sesay, a highly motivated 16-year-old who can't afford schoolbooks but borrows them from wealthier classmates and studies the texts outside every night with a flashlight because her tiny home is crowded and has no electricity.
Alimatu is one of seven children, her dad died years ago, her mom is illiterate and she herself sometimes must go without eating all day when money is tight. But she is a brilliant student on a path to fulfill her dream of becoming a lawyer because of an education revolution underway here in Sierra Leone. (And when she becomes a lawyer, she says, she's going to buy her mom a house.)
In 2018, the government here banned school fees, which had kept Alimatu's parents and millions of others from attending any school at all. The authorities have also outlawed corporal punishment in schools and ramped up investment in education, with more than 20 percent of the national budget allocated to teacher pay, school renovation and other education expenses. The result has been a 50 percent increase in enrollment and also an apparent improvement in the quality of education, with impoverished children benefiting the most.
Sierra Leone may offer a model for how even a very poor country, still recovering from an Ebola outbreak in 2014-16 that followed a particularly brutal 11-year civil war, can by sheer determination and leadership make schooling more equal. The United States and other countries could learn a thing or two in the ramshackle schools of Sierra Leone.
Yet Sierra Leone's grand experiment in promising "free quality school" is also maddeningly incomplete.
Alongside a rural road in northern Sierra Leone, I spotted several children doing farm work on a school day. I chatted with them, and it appeared that one reason they skip school is that they are regularly caned on the behind in front of the class for failing to pay the fees.
Caned? For failing to pay school fees in the public school system? Isn't that all illegal?
Issa, 16, shrugged. "I'm afraid to tell the teacher it's illegal," he said. "I'd be thrown out of school."
I'm on my annual win-a-trip journey, on which I take a student -- this year it's Maddie Bender, a recent graduate of Yale -- to look at global problems and fixes. Education has been a focus this time, for some 60 million children worldwide should be in primary school but aren't, and even more miss high school.
Sierra Leone is tackling educational problems in ways that are bold and promising, but the pronouncements in the capital haven't reached Issa's village. A school official will come to the classroom, he said, call the children who are behind on fees to come forward and whip each of them in front of the entire class with six strokes of a stick.
Of the 52 students in his class, 24 or 25 are beaten each week for being behind, he said, girls and boys alike. "Some kids cry," he said, adding, "The beating is to make them persuade their parents to pay the school fees."
Issa's younger brother, a primary school student, said he too was beaten regularly for not having money for school fees. Of the 35 students in his class, about 15 are routinely whipped for being late in paying, he said.
Next I visited that boy's primary school, where officials denied they charged school fees or beat pupils. The denials were unconvincing, partly because each teacher had a cane on the desk. (Stay tuned for a Times Opinion video about Sierra Leone's education revolution, which will include footage of these officials trying to explain away the unexplainable.)
At Issa's high school, I ran into the same implausible denials undermined by more canes in plain sight. I talked my way into the administrative office and was allowed to examine a register that the children had told me was used to determine who would be flogged. Sure enough: The book listed each child and whether he or she had paid fees of a bit more than $ 3 a term.
In my conversations with perhaps a dozen teachers, a couple did admit in a roundabout way to charging students, presenting it as the only way to pay staff when government funding is grossly inadequate.
Over several days of interviews in a half-dozen randomly chosen villages, almost all the children and parents I spoke to said that they were subjected to some kind of fee: school fees, book fees, lunch fees or admission fees. At nearly every rural school, students said they were flogged for falling short on fees.
My heart broke for a girl, Adamasay, 13, whose mother died this school year. As a result, she can't pay the fees -- so she is flogged in front of the class, five strokes each time on the behind.
I sat down with Sierra Leone's president, Julius Maada Bio, the architect of the education program, to ask about what I had seen. He looked pained -- but didn't deny it. "Flogged for being poor," he lamented. He emphasized that change takes time and that the government is committed to ending these abuses.
A pivotal figure in Sierra Leone's revolution in the schools is Moinina David Sengeh, 36, the dynamic minister of education, who attended Harvard as an undergraduate and then earned a Ph.D from the M.I.T. Media Lab while working in biomechatronics, the field where human bodies integrate with machines. Sengeh holds several patents in data science and in prosthetics; in his spare time, he helps designs sockets for prosthetic limbs.
Sengeh was working for IBM Research when President Bio summoned him home in 2018 to become the country's chief innovation officer and then minister of education. Sengeh has just published a book, "Radical Inclusion," that has been lavishly praised by Bill Gates as a "must-read," and he brings star power and attention to Sierra Leone's efforts.
Yet history is full of failed attempts to improve access to education in poor countries; it's easy to ban fees, but harder for the government to find new ways to pay for the public school system. Some African countries moved earlier to end fees, beginning with Ghana in 1961, and the result was an expansion in enrollment -- and often a decline in quality, as schools lost revenue but had more students to teach.
Quality of education remains a huge problem worldwide. The World Bank estimates that 70 percent of 10-year-olds in poor and middle-income countries can't read a simple text. In Nigeria, three-quarters of children age 7 to 14 can't read a simple sentence.
Sierra Leone is trying to break out of that trap with investments in more and better teachers who earn more, along with careful research and improved methods and accountability. To me, one of the most important initiatives in Sierra Leone is a series of randomized controlled trials that test different approaches to schooling. We may learn something here that can help improve education around the world.
Meanwhile, Alimatu is thriving in school but has just one school uniform, two years old, that must last one more year until she graduates. Her only pair of socks is the one that came with her uniform, and she has never lost a sock -- because that would mean an incomplete uniform and exclusion from school.
We should all have children like Alimatu who never lose a sock -- and who have a path forward to achieve their dreams. I hope the education revolution here in Sierra Leone will live up to its promise and prove contagious abroad, giving children like Alimatu in all countries the opportunity to get an education to transform their lives and their nations.

Shield Urged For Workers Hurt by A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tens of millions of jobs could be automated by generative artificial intelligence. The makers of new technologies are looking to the government to step in.
When Congress held a series of hearings on jobs and technological advancement in October 1955, the head of a railroad worker organization took the stand to express his fears about automation. "There is uneasiness among our workers as they assess the advance of the new technology," said W.P. Kennedy, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. "Will it bring increasing unemployment rather than economic security?"
The same question could have been raised before Congress last week in its hearing on artificial intelligence. In effect, it was.
Sam Altman, chief executive of the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, testified last Tuesday before members of a Senate subcommittee, urging the government to regulate the fast-growing A.I. industry. Congressional leaders shared their worries about the threats that A.I. could pose, including the spread of misinformation and privacy violations.
One of their most emphatic concerns was job displacement: Who will assume responsibility to protect workers whose jobs might be transformed, or even eliminated, by generative A.I.?
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, declared that his "biggest nightmare in the long term" is the job loss that A.I. could cause, before saying to Mr. Altman, "Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is."
"There will be an impact on jobs," Mr. Altman replied. "And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government."
Mr. Altman, like so many other executives unleashing new technologies on the world, has asked the government to assume the bulk of responsibility in supporting workers through the labor market disruptions prompted by A.I. It's not yet clear how government will rise to that task.
Generative A.I. could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. Already the chief executive of IBM said he expected A.I. to affect white-collar clerical staffing, eliminating the need for up to 30 percent of certain roles while creating new ones. The White House on Tuesday is hosting workers for a discussion of their experiences with automation and monitoring technologies in the workplace.
Historically, when automation has led to job loss, the economic impact has tended to be offset by the creation of new jobs. Generative artificial intelligence, according to the Goldman report, could raise America's labor productivity growth by nearly 1.5 percentage points per year over a decade. It could increase annual global gross domestic product by 7 percent. It could give rise to previously unimagined creative occupations.
But there will be immense instability for displaced workers. Automation has been a significant driver of income inequality in America, according to a study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University. By their estimates, 50 to 70 percent of changes in the U.S. wage structure since 1980 were due to loss of income among blue-collar and office workers because of automation.
Areas of the country where robots have been adopted most intensively, particularly manufacturing-heavy parts of the Midwest, have also seen the most precipitous declines in employment, according to research from Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T.
While makers of A.I. have tended to focus on the technology's potential for job creation, many workers will experience painful disruption as they try to train for and find new roles that pay well and are fulfilling.
"We've never been in a period where the scope of automation is so wide potentially," said Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown. "Historically if your job gets automated, you find something new. With A.I. the thing that's kind of scary is it could simply grow and take over more tasks. It's a moving target."
Workers in administrative and clerical support may have particular cause for concern about generative A.I., according to the Goldman research. And many of them are already expressing anxieties.
"It's definitely scary," said Justin Felt, 41, a customer service worker in Pittsburgh, who has worked for Verizon Fios for nearly 12 years. He feels that employers have not been entirely upfront with their workers about the ways they are incorporating generative A.I. into customer support roles, he said. "It's definitely taking our work."
These technologies are flooding into workplaces at a rapid clip. BuzzFeed just introduced a chatbot that offers up recipe recommendations, McKinsey is helping clients use A.I. to fix technological bugs and the accounting firm KPMG is using ChatGPT to generate code. So some economists have begun putting forward proposals to protect the workers most likely to be affected.
Workers could benefit, for example, from paid leave policies that allow them to take time away from their jobs to develop new skills. Germany already has a similar program, in which workers in most German states can take at least five paid days a year for educational courses, an initiative the labor minister recently said he planned to expand.
Another possibility is a displacement tax, levied on employers when a worker's job is automated but the person is not retrained, which could make businesses more inclined to retrain workers. The government could also offer A.I. companies financial incentives to create products designed to augment what workers do, rather than replace them -- for example, A.I. that provides TV writers with research but doesn't draft scripts, which are likely to be of low quality.
"If the government sets the agenda in developing technologies that are more complementary to humans, that would be very important," Mr. Acemoglu said. "Industry is looking to the government for leadership."
The government's previous efforts to support workers through periods of job displacement have had mixed results. A study of Trade Adjustment Assistance, a U.S. government program that provides financial assistance and training for workers who lose jobs because of trade, found that manufacturing employees who temporarily dropped out of the work force to participate in the program in the early 2000s still hadn't caught up on earnings several years later compared with workers who lost jobs but didn't qualify for T.A.A. support.
Many economists say employers could also play a role in helping displaced workers.
"Business always looks to government to deal with job loss," said Simon Johnson, a professor at M.I.T. and a co-author with Mr. Acemoglu of the book "Power and Progress." "But Microsoft and Alphabet -- they are in the driver's seat, in regards to where they choose to put their technological resources."
Workers could benefit, for example, from employer apprenticeships and retraining programs. The accounting giant PwC recently announced a $ 1 billion investment in generative A.I., which includes efforts to train its 65,000 workers on how to use A.I. What spurred the initiative was the chief executive's trip to the World Economic Forum's gathering in Davos, Switzerland, where he heard constant discussion of generative A.I.
"A number of us walking out of that room knew something had changed," recalled Joe Atkinson, the company's chief products and technology officer.
PwC's workers have expressed fears about displacement, according to Mr. Atkinson, especially as their company explores automating roles with generative A.I. Mr. Atkinson stressed, though, that PwC planned to retrain people with new technical skills so their work would change but their jobs wouldn't be eliminated.
Some tech companies are offering employees courses in cloud computing, cybersecurity and generative A.I. Among them is IBM, which also has an apprenticeship program that trains workers, including those without four-year degrees, for high-paying roles in fields like software development and data science. The company C3 AI offers its 1,000 employees bonuses of $ 250 to $ 1,500 for becoming certified in technological subjects including A.I. and cloud computing. KPMG is working to train every one of its employees to use generative A.I.
Community colleges are intensifying their focus on A.I., too. Miami Dade College has received over $ 15 million in grants for its technology programs, with some of the money used to open two centers focused on preparing students for careers in A.I. Houston Community College recently announced a bachelor's degree in A.I. and robotics, and Southwest Tennessee Community College is working to create an associate degree. The American Association of Community Colleges launched an A.I. incubator network focused on helping faculty teach about A.I. and colleges create A.I. degrees.
"As Wayne Gretzky once said when asked about his success, 'I skate to where the puck is going,"' said Dennis Natali, a professor at Pikes Peak State College in Colorado, which released a plan this year to roll out A.I. certificates. "Our college constantly assesses the work force landscape and prepares to support displaced workers."
As colleges and businesses scramble to retrain workers, some experts are optimistic about this technological transition. They note that throughout history people have feared technological advancement but often ended up benefiting from it, going back to the Luddites, weavers who protested the mechanization of the textile industry.
But that doesn't mean the transition period will unfold smoothly. Michael Chui, an A.I. expert at McKinsey, pointed out that even the Luddites saw their income stagnate for decades.
"Anyone who loses their job involuntarily -- it's a difficult time," he said. "In some ways the Luddites weren't wrong about the risk."

No Plea Made By Suspect In the Killing Of 4 in Idaho: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bryan Kohberger, the former Ph.D. student accused of killing four University of Idaho students, appeared in court Monday after being indicted on murder charges.
The man accused of murdering four college students during a predawn intrusion at their house near the University of Idaho declined to enter a plea to the charges Monday, electing to "stand silent" during the first step in what promises to be a lengthy legal process.
Judge John C. Judge said he would enter a not-guilty plea for the defendant, Bryan Kohberger, after Mr. Kohberger's lawyer, Anne Taylor, said her client had elected not to enter any plea at this stage. Mr. Kohberger has said through a lawyer in the past that he expects to be exonerated.
A trial was set to begin in October in Moscow, the quiet Idaho college town that had not recorded a murder in the seven years before the four students were killed Nov. 13.
Investigators have said in court records that they linked Mr. Kohberger to the killings with the help of DNA found on a knife sheath at the crime scene, as well as through surveillance video that showed a car similar to his near the house around the time of the killings.
At that time, Mr. Kohberger was studying for a doctorate in criminology at Washington State University, a few miles across the state border from the University of Idaho campus. Prosecutors have not disclosed any prior connections between him and any of the four victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.
In the hours before the killings, Ms. Mogen and Ms. Goncalves were out at a bar, and they stopped at a food truck before returning home. Ms. Kernodle and Mr. Chapin were at a party.
Investigators said that the victims and two other people who lived in the house were home by 2 a.m. on Nov. 13. After that, investigators have said, surveillance video showed a white car appearing repeatedly next to the house. Mr. Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra.
The authorities said Mr. Kohberger's cellphone was moving through the region in the early morning hours, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps it had been turned off, they said -- during a two-hour period around the time of the killings.
Investigators spent weeks looking for a suspect in the case. Eventually, they learned that DNA they had found on the knife sheath was related to DNA they found at Mr. Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kohberger had gone in early December at the end of the fall semester.
The semester ended with Mr. Kohberger embroiled in turmoil on his own campus, where officials investigated two altercations he had with a professor and complaints about his conduct around women. Mr. Kohberger was terminated from his teaching assistant position several weeks after the killings. He was arrested in Pennsylvania on Dec. 30.
Mr. Kohberger's lawyers had been preparing for a lengthy preliminary hearing in the case that was scheduled to take place at the end of June, but a grand jury indictment last week made that hearing unnecessary. Much of the evidence gathered by prosecutors that could have been made public at such a hearing will instead remain undisclosed for now.
Mr. Kohberger arrived at the hearing Monday in an orange jumpsuit, with shackles around his ankles. As he looked out across the packed courtroom toward a group of relatives of the victims, they stared at him in silence.
Mr. Kohberger repeatedly responded "yes" as he was asked whether he understood each of the charges against him, and whether he understood that he could face life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on each of the four murder counts.
The refusal to enter a plea at this point is unlikely to have a significant impact on the case, said Eve Brensike Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan and an expert in criminal procedure.
Ms. Primus said that lawyers may recommend that course when they expect to argue that their client is not competent to stand trial or is not guilty by reason of insanity.
Idaho is one of four states that do not provide explicitly for insanity pleas, but defendants in the state can introduce testimony at trial to show that, as a result of mental illness, they are not guilty of certain elements of a crime, like the "malice aforethought" that must be proved in order for a jury to convict a defendant of murder.
Another possible explanation, Ms. Primus said, is that Mr. Kohberger did not want to tell the court he was not guilty. In that situation, his lawyer might decide on standing silent, allowing Mr. Kohberger to avoid pleading out loud, while still moving the case forward as if he had pleaded not guilty.
"Practically, there is no difference in effect," Ms. Primus said. "But if there are mental health issues, there might be reasons why you might not want your client to speak in court."
The hearing on Monday started the clock on a 60-day period in which prosecutors must decide whether to seek the death penalty in the case. The parents of one victim, Ms. Goncalves, have said they want the death penalty if Mr. Kohberger is convicted.
In a statement after the hearing on Monday, the Goncalves family said the hearing was "just the beginning of a long journey for all the families."

The Optimist's Guide to A.I. And Its Value in the Workplace: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The focus of much discussion is on how it will replace jobs, but nothing is inevitable.
It's easy to fear that the machines are taking over: Companies like IBM and the British telecommunications company BT have cited artificial intelligence as a reason for reducing head count, and new tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E make it possible for anyone to understand the extraordinary abilities of artificial intelligence for themselves. One recent study from researchers at OpenAI (the start-up behind ChatGPT) and the University of Pennsylvania concluded that for about 80 percent of jobs, at least 10 percent of tasks could be automated using the technology behind such tools.
"Everybody I talk to, supersmart people, doctors, lawyers, C.E.O.s, other economists, your brain just first goes to, 'Oh, how can generative A.I. replace this thing that humans are doing?"' said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI.
But that's not the only option, he said. "The other thing that I wish people would do more of is think about what new things could be done now that was never done before. Obviously that's a much harder question." It is also, he added, "where most of the value is."
How technology makers design, business leaders use and policymakers regulate A.I. tools will determine how generative A.I. ultimately affects jobs, Brynjolfsson and other economists say. And not all the choices are necessarily bleak for workers.
A.I. can complement human labor rather than replace it. Plenty of companies use A.I. to automate call centers, for instance. But a Fortune 500 company that provides business software has instead used a tool like ChatGPT to give its workers live suggestions for how to respond to customers. Brynjolfsson and his co-authors of a study compared the call center employees who used the tool to those who didn't. They found that the tool boosted productivity by 14 percent on average, with most of the gains made by low-skilled workers. Customer sentiment was also higher and employee turnover lower in the group that used the tool.
David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that A.I. could potentially be used to deliver "expertise on tap" in jobs like health care delivery, software development, law, and skilled repair. "That offers an opportunity to enable more workers to do valuable work that relies on some of that expertise," he said.
Workers can focus on different tasks. As A.T.M.s automated the tasks of dispensing cash and taking deposits, the number of bank tellers increased, according to an analysis by James Bessen, a researcher at the Boston University School of Law. This was partly because while bank branches required fewer workers, they became cheaper to open -- and banks opened more of them. But banks also changed the job description. After A.T.M.s, tellers focused less on counting cash and more on building relationships with customers, to whom they sold products like credit cards. Few jobs can be completely automated by generative A.I. But using an A.I. tool for some tasks may free up workers to expand their work on tasks that can't be automated.
New technology can lead to new jobs. Farming employed nearly 42 percent of the work force in 1900, but because of automation and advances in technology, it accounted for just 2 percent by 2000. The huge reduction in farming jobs didn't result in widespread unemployment. Instead, technology created a lot of new jobs. A farmer in the early 20th century would not have imagined computer coding, genetic engineering or trucking. In an analysis that used census data, Autor and his co-authors found that 60 percent of current occupational specialties did not exist 80 years ago.
Of course, there's no guarantee that workers will be qualified for new jobs, or that they'll be good jobs. And none of this just happens, said Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at M.I.T. and a co-author of "Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology & Prosperity."
"If we make the right choices, then we do create new types of jobs, which is crucial for wage growth and also for truly reaping the productivity benefits," Acemoglu said. "But if we do not make the right choices, much less of this can happen." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Martha's model behavior. The lifestyle entrepreneur Martha Stewart became the oldest person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue this week. Stewart, 81, told The Times that it was a "large challenge" to have the confidence to pose but that two months of Pilates had helped. She isn't the first person over 60 to have the distinction: Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, graced the cover last year at the age of 74.
TikTok block. Montana became the first state to ban the Chinese short video app, barring app stores from offering TikTok within its borders starting Jan. 1. The ban is expected to be difficult to enforce, and TikTok users in the state have sued the government, saying the measure violates their First Amendment rights and giving a glimpse of the potential blowback if the federal government tries to block TikTok nationwide.
Banker blame game. Greg Becker, the ex-C.E.O. of Silicon Valley Bank, blamed "rumors and misconceptions" for a run on deposits in his first public comments since the lender collapsed in March. Becker and former top executives of the failed Signature Bank also told a Senate committee investigating their role in the collapse of the banks that they would not give back millions of dollars in pay.
A brief history of tech C.E.O.s seeking constraints
When OpenAI's chief executive, Sam Altman, testified in Congress this week and called for regulation of generative artificial intelligence, some lawmakers hailed it as a "historic" move. In fact, asking lawmakers for new rules is a move straight out of the tech industry playbook. Silicon Valley's most powerful executives have long gone to Washington to demonstrate their commitment to rules in an attempt to shape them while simultaneously unleashing some of the world's most powerful and transformative technologies without pause.
One reason: A federal rule is much easier to manage than different regulations in different states, Bruce Mehlman, a political consultant and former technology policy official in the Bush administration, told DealBook. Clearer regulations also give investors more confidence in a sector, he added.
The strategy sounds sensible, but if history is a useful guide, the reality can be messier than the rhetoric:
In December 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, was one of six executives to testify about digital assets in the House and call for regulatory clarity. His company had just submitted a proposal for a "unified joint regime," he told lawmakers. A year later, Bankman-Fried's businesses were bankrupt, and he was facing criminal fraud and illegal campaign contribution charges.
In 2019, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post, "The Internet Needs New Rules," based on failures in content moderation, election integrity, privacy and data management at the company. Two years later, independent researchers found that misinformation was more rampant on the platform than in 2016, even though the company had spent billions trying to stamp it out.
In 2018, the Apple chief Tim Cook said he was generally averse to regulation but supported more strict data privacy rules, saying, "It's time for a set of people to think about what can be done." But to maintain its business in China, one of its biggest markets, Apple has largely ceded control of customer data to the government as part of its requirements to operate there.
Buzzword of the week: 'Algospeak'
Platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter use algorithms to identify and moderate problematic content. To avert these digital moderators and allow free exchange about taboo topics, a linguistic code has developed. It's called "algospeak."
"A linguistic arms race is raging online -- and it isn't clear who's winning," writes Roger J. Kreuz, a psychology professor at the University of Memphis. Posts about sensitive issues like politics, sex or suicide can be flagged by algorithms and taken down, leading to the use of creative misspellings and stand-ins, like "seggs" and "mascara" for sex, "unalive" for death and "cornucopia" for homophobia. There is a history of responding to prohibitions with code, Kruz notes, such as 19th-century Cockney rhyming slang in England or "Aesopian," an allegorical language used to circumvent censorship in Tsarist Russia.
Algorithms aren't alone in not picking up on the code. The euphemisms and misspellings are particularly ubiquitous among marginalized communities. But the hidden language also sometimes eludes humans, leading to potentially fraught miscommunications online. In February, the celebrity Julia Fox found herself in an awkward exchange with a victim of sexual assault after misunderstanding a post about "mascara" and had to issue a public apology for responding inappropriately to what she thought was a discussion about makeup.

Full text: Tech nerds see the current moment for artificial intelligence as similar to the time when the Netscape browser was released, stirring innovation.
/nĕt-scāpe mō-mĕnt/
A term used to describe when an under-the-hood technology that was being developed for many years is suddenly seen and recognized as disruptive and potentially revolutionary.
As Silicon Valley has been gripped by a frenzy over artificial intelligence, some techies have been trying to put this latest tech boom into perspective. One way to think about it is as A.I.'s "Netscape moment."
Here's what that means.
Essentially, there are parallels between today's fervor for A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard and the excitement over the Netscape browser from the 1990s. Both allowed people to recognize the possibilities around an existing technology, leading to new innovation.
The Netscape browser was one of the first tools that helped people easily surf the World Wide Web. While the internet had been around since the 1960s, in its early days it was used mostly by academics, and it was difficult for anyone else to gain access to it.
But Netscape Navigator, developed by Marc Andreessen and released in 1994, let the general public see and smoothly browse web pages -- quickly leading to the understanding that the internet could be used by us all. That spawned the late-1990s dot-com boom, with the establishment of websites like eBay and Amazon, eventually giving rise to the internet we know today.
Chatbots have similarly made people realize the power of A.I., a technology that has been in development for decades, in fits and starts. When ChatGPT debuted last year and people tapped it to generate business plans, screenplays, poems and more, many began comprehending how A.I. could apply to their daily lives -- and also disrupt what they were doing.
Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, explained it at a speaking series last month at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.
"I kind of think of ChatGPT as doing the Netscape moment," he said. He also said that it may seem like chatbots were "overnight wonders, but there has been 30 years of hard, grinding work."
In the past few months, Microsoft, Google, Meta and others have pushed harder into the A.I. race. Venture capitalists are pouring money into A.I. start-ups. And companies, universities and schools have realized they must adjust how they do things because of this A.I. wave.
Some techies have likened the A.I. boom to an "iPhone moment," referring to how the Apple device, which was introduced in 2007, led to an avalanche of mobile apps. But to nerds like me, that's not quite right because the iPhone was a hardware trigger, rather than an under-the-hood technology like a browser or chatbot. That's why a "Netscape moment" seems a more apt analogy.

Suspect Indicted in Fatal Stabbing of 4 University of Idaho Students: [National Desk]

Full text: Instead of facing a preliminary hearing, the Ph.D. student accused of killing four University of Idaho students will be arraigned on murder charges next week.
The man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students last year has been indicted by a grand jury and will be arraigned on murder charges next week, a court spokesman said Wednesday.
The suspect, Bryan Kohberger, a former graduate student in criminology at a nearby university, was arrested in the case in December but has yet to enter a plea. Defense lawyers had moved to hold an extended preliminary hearing, scheduled for next month, that would have explored much of the evidence collected by investigators, but the grand jury indictment eliminates that process.
The authorities have yet to describe a motive or lay out many details of the killings, in which the four victims were stabbed to death in the predawn hours one Sunday in November in a house not far from campus. They have not detailed any prior connections between Mr. Kohberger and the victims, Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.
Mr. Kohberger, originally from Pennsylvania, had been a Ph.D. student studying criminology at Washington State University in Pullman, just across the state border from the Idaho campus. Investigators have said they linked him to the scene with DNA found on a knife sheath in the home, apparently matching that sample to his father after testing trash at the family's home.
Mr. Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra that appeared to match a vehicle seen on surveillance footage near the home, investigators have said. An affidavit filed by the police said that Mr. Kohberger's phone was detected moving around the region in the hours before and after the killings but that it was disconnected from cell networks, perhaps turned off, for about two hours around the time of the killings.
The case has upended life in the community of Moscow, Idaho, which had not recorded a murder in seven years. Residents of the town spent weeks in uncertainty as investigators struggled to find a suspect. In recent days, at graduation ceremonies, the University of Idaho honored the four victims with posthumous degrees or certificates.
Mr. Kohberger has said through a public defender that he expects to be exonerated. Nate Poppino, a court spokesman, said that Mr. Kohberger would be arraigned on the new indictment at a hearing scheduled for Monday morning.
Former friends and his own online postings have detailed Mr. Kohberger's troubled past, including emotional problems and heroin use that he struggled with in his teenage years. He had appeared to turn his life around after getting clean and focusing on his studies, they reported, and he had said that he hoped to one day provide counseling for high-profile criminals.
But after arriving at Washington State University last year, he appeared to run into new trouble. The university counseled him over a verbal altercation he had with a professor and investigated his conduct with women around the time of the killings. He was ultimately fired from his job as a teaching assistant in December, shortly before his arrest at his parents' home in Pennsylvania.

Electric Work Vans Find Eager Buyers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Passenger cars dominate the electric vehicle market, but light delivery trucks could benefit from the cost savings and range E.V.s offer.
Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business last November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $ 110 to $ 140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance -- about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $ 9 a week.
"I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive," said Mr. Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Mo., just east of Kansas City. "But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate."
In the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of E.V.s were up 45 percent from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual E.V. sales total in the U.S. market to top one million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don't need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge.
One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in. Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning.
Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don't need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don't burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet commercial E.V.s have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Start-ups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a start-up backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and G.M., two of the country's largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford's Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the United States Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
G.M. created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022, and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.
Along with the truck, BrightDrop has developed an electric cart to enable drivers to haul many packages from the truck, reducing the number of trips the driver makes back and forth. One version of the cart is refrigerated for deliveries of produce and groceries.
In Hooksett, N.H., Merchants Fleet, a company that manages vehicles used by delivery services, has been using 150 BrightDrop vans over the past year, and is eager to add more.
Brad Jacobs, the company's vice president for fleet consulting, said the depreciation cost and the cost of interest on the capital used to buy electric vans were roughly the same as for combustion engine trucks.
"What we've learned from the vehicles on the road is that you save anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 a year because the cost of fuel and maintenance is so much lower with electric vehicles," he said. "If a company is planning on service life of five years, that's a savings of $ 50,000 per vehicle. That's very compelling."
Merchants Fleet has orders for 750 more BrightDrop trucks and reservations on an additional 17,000, Mr. Jacobs said.
Large delivery companies have been clamoring for electric trucks for years. Amazon hopes to buy as many as 100,000 vans from Rivian, and is considering an electric Ram ProMaster van that Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, is supposed to start making this year.
UPS has ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a start-up company based in Luxembourg that has operations in Britain. Arrival has suffered financial troubles and production delays. FedEx, plans to buy only battery-powered vans starting in 2030, and hopes to operate an all-electric fleet by 2040. It has been testing 150 BrightDrop trucks, is taking delivery on 350 more and has reservations for an additional 2,000.
Nelson Granados, a FedEx delivery driver in Inglewood, Calif., has been using a BrightDrop vehicle for the past year, a white van with the orange-and-purple FedEx logo next to a picture of a bright green plug and electric cord.
Mr. Granados gives the truck a thumbs-up. The truck has comforts the diesel vans lack like a stereo and heated seats, as well as a lower floor that makes entering and leaving easier.
"You're getting in and out all day, so it pays off," Mr. Granados said. "It's like a luxury delivery truck."
Mr. Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games -- he has season tickets -- so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Mr. Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he's reaping from the E-Transit.
"When I look at the cost over five years," he said with a laugh, "it's almost like getting a free van."

“You’re getting in and out all day, so it pays off,” Granados said. “It’s like a luxury delivery truck.”
Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games — he has season tickets — so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he’s reaping from the E-Transit.
“When I look at the cost over five years,” he said with a laugh, “it’s almost like getting a free van.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech executive and lawmakers agreed that new A.I. systems must be regulated. Just how that would happen is not yet clear.
The tone of congressional hearings featuring tech industry executives in recent years can best be described as antagonistic. Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and other tech luminaries have all been dressed down on Capitol Hill by lawmakers upset with their companies.
But on Tuesday, Sam Altman, the chief executive of the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, testified before members of a Senate subcommittee and largely agreed with them on the need to regulate the increasingly powerful A.I. technology being created inside his company and others like Google and Microsoft.
In his first testimony before Congress, Mr. Altman implored lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence as members of the committee displayed a budding understanding of the technology. The hearing underscored the deep unease felt by technologists and government over A.I.'s potential harms. But that unease did not extend to Mr. Altman, who had a friendly audience in the members of the subcommittee.
The appearance of Mr. Altman, a 38-year-old Stanford University dropout and tech entrepreneur, was his christening as the leading figure in A.I. The boyish-looking Mr. Altman traded in his usual pullover sweater and jeans for a blue suit and tie for the three-hour hearing.
Mr. Altman also talked about his company's technology at a dinner with dozens of House members on Monday night, and met privately with a number of senators before the hearing, according to people who attended the dinner and the meetings. He offered a loose framework to manage what happens next with the fast-developing systems that some believe could fundamentally change the economy.
"I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that," he said. "We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening."
Mr. Altman made his public debut on Capitol Hill as interest in A.I. has exploded. Tech giants have poured effort and billions of dollars into what they say is a transformative technology, even amid rising concerns about A.I.'s role in spreading misinformation, killing jobs and one day matching human intelligence.
That has thrust the technology into the spotlight in Washington. President Biden this month said at a meeting with a group of chief executives of A.I. companies that "what you're doing has enormous potential and enormous danger." Top leaders in Congress have also promised A.I. regulations.
That members of the Senate subcommittee for privacy, technology and the law did not plan on a rough grilling for Mr. Altman was clear as they thanked Mr. Altman for his private meetings with them and for agreeing to appear in the hearing. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, repeatedly referred to Mr. Altman by his first name.
Mr. Altman was joined at the hearing by Christina Montgomery, IBM's chief privacy and trust officer, and Gary Marcus, a well-known professor and frequent critic of A.I. technology.
Mr. Altman said his company's technology may destroy some jobs but also create new ones, and that it will be important for "government to figure out how we want to mitigate that." Echoing an idea suggested by Dr. Marcus, he proposed the creation of an agency that issues licenses for the development of large-scale A.I. models, safety regulations and tests that A.I. models must pass before being released to the public.
"We believe that the benefits of the tools we have deployed so far vastly outweigh the risks, but ensuring their safety is vital to our work," Mr. Altman said.
But it was unclear how lawmakers would respond to the call to regulate A.I. The track record of Congress on tech regulations is grim. Dozens of privacy, speech and safety bills have failed over the past decade because of partisan bickering and fierce opposition by tech giants.
The United States has trailed the globe on regulations in privacy, speech and protections for children. It is also behind on A.I. regulations. Lawmakers in the European Union are set to introduce rules for the technology later this year. And China has created A.I. laws that comply with its censorship laws.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate panel, said the hearing was the first in a series to learn more about the potential benefits and harms of A.I. to eventually "write the rules" for it.
He also acknowledged Congress's failure to keep up with the introduction of new technologies in the past. "Our goal is to demystify and hold accountable those new technologies to avoid some of the mistakes of the past," Mr. Blumenthal said. "Congress failed to meet the moment on social media."
Members of the subcommittee suggested an independent agency to oversee A.I.; rules that force companies to disclose how their models work and the data sets they use; and antitrust rules to prevent companies like Microsoft and Google from monopolizing the nascent market.
"The devil will be in the details," said Sarah Myers West, managing director of AI Now Institute, a policy research center. She said Mr. Altman's suggestions for regulations don't go far enough and should include limits on how A.I. is used in policing and the use of biometric data. She noted that Mr. Altman didn't show any indication of slowing down the development of OpenAI's ChatGPT tool.
"It's such an irony seeing a posture about the concern of harms by people who are rapidly releasing into commercial use the system responsible for those very harms," Ms. West said.
Some lawmakers in the hearing still displayed the persistent gap in technological know-how between Washington and Silicon Valley. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, repeatedly asked witnesses if a speech liability shield for online platforms like Facebook and Google also applies to A.I.
Mr. Altman, calm and unruffled, tried several times to draw a distinction between A.I. and social media. "We need to work together to find a totally new approach," he said.
Some subcommittee members also showed a reluctance to clamp down too strongly on an industry with great economic promise for the United States and that competes directly with adversaries such as China.
The Chinese are creating A.I. that "reinforce the core values of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese system," said Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. "And I'm concerned about how we promote A.I. that reinforces and strengthens open markets, open societies and democracy."
Some of the toughest questions and comments toward Mr. Altman came from Dr. Marcus, who noted OpenAI hasn't been transparent about the data its uses to develop its systems. He expressed doubt in Mr. Altman's prediction that new jobs will replace those killed off by A.I.
"We have unprecedented opportunities here but we are also facing a perfect storm of corporate irresponsibility, widespread deployment, lack of adequate regulation and inherent unreliability," Dr. Marcus said.
Tech companies have argued that Congress should be careful with any broad rules that lump different kinds of A.I. together. In Tuesday's hearing, Ms. Montgomery of IBM called for an A.I. law that is similar to Europe's proposed regulations, which outlines various levels of risk. She called for rules that focus on specific uses, not regulating the technology itself.
"At its core, A.I. is just a tool, and tools can serve different purposes," she said, adding that Congress should take a "precision regulation approach to A.I."

As Japan Unmasks, Coach Is Giving Lessons in Smiling: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After three years of Covid-era masking, some Japanese people feel their facial expressions are a bit rusty. Enter Keiko Kawano, smile instructor.
About six years ago, Keiko Kawano, a radio host, found that when she stopped doing voice-articulation exercises, her smile began to fade. At a certain point, she struggled to lift the corners of her mouth.
So Ms. Kawano, then 43, decided to learn how facial muscles work. After using the knowledge to reanimate her smile, she started helping others do the same under the motto, "More smile, more happiness."
And as many people in Japan unmask after three years and find their facial expressions a bit rusty, she is adapting her work to the post-Covid era.
"People have not been raising their cheeks under a mask or trying to smile much," Ms. Kawano said last week, a few days after Japan downgraded Covid-19 to the same status as common illnesses. "Now, they're at a loss."
Ms. Kawano began teaching smiling at a gym in 2017 while working as a business etiquette trainer.
Despite having no medical training, her curriculum, typically taught in one-hour sessions online or in person, draws on yoga and emphasizes strengthening the zygomatic muscles, which pull the corners of the mouth. She also believes that the muscles just below the eyes are key and that weak ones create eyebrow-driven smiles, which can make the forehead look wrinkly.
"People train their body muscles, but not their faces," she said.
After her gig at the gym, she began teaching smiling at nursing homes and corporate offices, as well as to individuals hoping that a better smile might help to land better jobs or improve marriage prospects. One early client was IBM Japan, where she held a smiling-training session for company employees and their families.
Then the pandemic hit, hurting her business by hiding everyone's smiles behind face masks. Still, Ms. Kawano was occasionally asked for advice on smiling through them.
Mask wearing was not legally enforced in Japan during the pandemic, but it became ubiquitous anyway, in part because Japanese people have been masking for decades as protection against allergies or pollution or as a courtesy to protect others from illness.
Ms. Kawano told her clients that the key to a masked smile was lifting the eye muscles. A TV presenter demonstrated her method on a national broadcast, she said, and a post about it online helped to raise her profile.
But the biggest spike in demand for her services came in February, she said, when the government announced that official masking recommendations would be significantly loosened.
"People started realizing that they hadn't used their cheek or mouth muscles very much," Ms. Kawano said, speaking by phone while on a trip to South Korea, where she had an appointment for a facial that she said would be good for her cheekbones. "And you can't just suddenly start using these muscles. You need to work on them."
Yael Hanein, an expert on facial expressions, said she was not aware of any academic studies documenting the effects of long-term masking on facial muscles.
"Facial muscles can be trained like other muscles, although such training could be challenging, owing to large variability between individuals," said Professor Hanein, who runs a neuro-engineering lab at Tel Aviv University in Israel.
"A possible problem with a practiced or faked smile is that it may be identified as such by other people," she added.
There have been other smile-training classes in modern Japan, usually for retail employees. But in a Japanese social context, smiling is far less important than bowing. Some Japanese women are also acculturated to cover their mouths when eating or laughing.
"Smiling lessons seem very Western," said Tomohisa Sumida, a visiting researcher at Keio University who has studied the history of masking in Japan.
But Ms. Kawano's clients appear to be happy with her work.
Miki Okamoto, a spokeswoman for IBM Japan, said that Ms. Kawano's smile-training session was "received well."
In Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, about 40 seniors attended a 90-minute session with Ms. Kawano in October, and many found that it improved their smiles, said Katsuyo Iwahashi, a town official who works on public health programs. Ms. Iwahashi added that the town plans to offer a similar session specifically for mothers with young children "in the hope of helping them to smile despite the hardships that they experience," in motherhood and following the pandemic.
Ms. Kawano also holds a one-day certification training for people who want to teach smiling for 80,000 yen, plus consumption tax, about $ 650.
One of her protégés, Rieko Mae, 61, now tells her own clients that smile practice is important even for people who smile a lot naturally.
"Sometimes, you need to show a nice, professional smile, and people don't know much about that," said Ms. Mae, who lives in Osaka and traveled to Tokyo for the course.
A smile-training course could help people improve their facial expressions and even build self-confidence, said Masami Yamaguchi, a psychologist at Chuo University who has studied how babies look at the facial expressions of their mothers.
"Intentional muscle moves will send signals to your brain and generate positive feelings, even if you are not feeling happy," she said.

A Hurdle-Filled Race To Make Computer Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For more than 50 years, designers of computer chips mainly used one tactic to boost performance: They shrank electronic components to pack more power onto each piece of silicon.
Then more than a decade ago, engineers at the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices began toying with a radical idea. Instead of designing one big microprocessor with vast numbers of tiny transistors, they conceived of creating one from smaller chips that would be packaged tightly together to work like one electronic brain.
The concept, sometimes called chiplets, caught on in a big way, with AMD, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, IBM and Intel introducing such products. Chiplets rapidly gained traction because smaller chips are cheaper to make, while bundles of them can top the performance of any single slice of silicon.
The strategy, based on advanced packaging technology, has since become an essential tool to enabling progress in semiconductors. And it represents one of the biggest shifts in years for an industry that drives innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and military hardware.
"Packaging is where the action is going to be," said Subramanian Iyer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, who helped pioneer the chiplet concept. "It's happening because there is actually no other way."
The catch is that such packaging, like making chips themselves, is overwhelmingly dominated by companies in Asia. Although the United States accounts for around 12 percent of global semiconductor production, American companies provide just 3 percent of chip packaging, according to IPC, a trade association.
That issue has now landed chiplets in the middle of U.S. industrial policymaking. The CHIPS Act, a $ 52 billion subsidy package that passed last summer, was seen as President Biden's move to reinvigorate domestic chip making by providing money to build more sophisticated factories called "fabs." But part of it was also aimed at stoking advanced packaging factories in the United States to capture more of that essential process.
"As chips get smaller, the way you arrange the chips, which is packaging, is more and more important and we need it done in America," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, said in a speech at Georgetown University in February.
The Commerce Department is now accepting applications for manufacturing grants from the CHIPS Act, including for chip packaging factories. It is also allocating funding to a research program specifically on advanced packaging.
Some chip packaging companies are moving quickly for the funding. One is Integra Technologies in Wichita, Kan., which announced plans for a $ 1.8 billion expansion there but said that was contingent on receiving federal subsidies. Amkor Technology, an Arizona packaging service that has most of its operations in Asia, also said it was talking to customers and government officials about a U.S. production presence.
Packaging chips together isn't a new concept and chiplets are just the latest iteration of that idea, using technological advances that help cram the chips closer together -- either side by side or stacked on top of one another -- along with faster electrical connections between them.
"What is unique about chiplets is the way they are connected electrically," said Richard Otte, the chief executive of Promex Industries, a chip packaging service in Santa Clara, Calif.
Chips can't do anything without a way to connect them with other components, which means they need to be placed in some kind of package that can carry electrical signals. That process starts after factories complete the initial phase of manufacturing, which may create hundreds of chips on a silicon wafer. Once that wafer is sliced apart, individual chips are typically bonded to a key base layer called a substrate, which can conduct electrical signals.
That combination is then coated in protective plastic, forming a package that can be plugged into a circuit board that is essential for connecting to other components in a system.
These processes originally required lots of manual labor, leading Silicon Valley companies to shift packaging to lower-wage countries in Asia more than 50 years ago. Most chips are typically flown to packaging services in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China.
Since then, packaging advances have gained importance because of the diminishing returns from Moore's Law, the shorthand expression for chip miniaturization that for decades drove progress in Silicon Valley. It is named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, whose 1965 paper described how rapidly companies had doubled the number of transistors on a typical chip, which improved performance at a lower cost.
But these days, smaller transistors are not necessarily cheaper, partly because building factories for leading-edge chips can cost $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion. Big, complex chips also are costly to design and tend to have more manufacturing defects, even as companies in fields like generative A.I. want more transistors than can currently be packed onto the biggest chips manufacturing machines allow.
"The natural response to that is putting more things in a package," said Anirudh Devgan, chief executive of Cadence Design Systems, whose software is used to design conventional chips as well as chiplet-style products.
Synopsys, a rival, said it was tracking more than 140 customer projects based on packaging multiple chips together. As much as 80 percent of microprocessors will use chiplet-style designs by 2027, according to the market research firm Yole Group.
Today, companies typically design all the chiplets in a package along with their own connection technology. But industry groups are working on technical standards so companies can more easily assemble products from chiplets that come from different makers.
The new technology is mostly used now for extreme performance. Intel recently introduced a processor called Ponte Vecchio with 47 chiplets that will be used in a powerful supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, which is near Chicago.
In January, AMD disclosed plans for an unusual product, the MI300, that combines chiplets for standard calculations with others designed for computer graphics, along with a large pool of memory chips. That processor, intended to power another advanced supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has 146 billion transistors, compared with tens of billions for most advanced conventional chips.
Sam Naffziger, an AMD senior vice president, said it wasn't a slam-dunk for the company to bet its chip business for server computers on chiplets. Packaging complexities were a major hurdle, he said, which were eventually overcome with help from an undisclosed partner.
But chiplets have paid off for AMD. The company has sold more than 12 million chips based on the idea since 2017, according to Mercury Research, and has become a major player in microprocessors that power the web.
Packaging services still need others to supply the substrates that chiplets require to connect to circuit boards and one another. One company driving the chiplet boom is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which already makes chips for AMD and hundreds of others and offers an advanced silicon-based substrate called an interposer.
Intel has been developing similar technology, as well as enhancing less-expensive conventional plastic substrates in an approach favored by some such as the Silicon Valley start-up Eliyan. Intel has also been developing new packaging prototypes under a Pentagon program and hopes to win CHIPs Act support for a new pilot packaging plant.
But the United States has no major makers of those substrates, which are primarily produced in Asia and evolved from technologies used in manufacturing circuit boards. Many U.S. companies have also left that business, another worry that industry groups hope will spur federal funding to help board suppliers start making substrates.
In March, Mr. Biden issued a determination that advanced packaging and domestic circuit board production were essential for national security, and announced $ 50 million in Defense Production Act funding for American and Canadian companies in those fields.
Even with such subsidies, assembling all the elements required to reduce U.S. dependence on Asian companies "is a huge challenge," said Andreas Olofsson, who ran a Defense Department research effort in the field before founding a packaging start-up called Zero ASIC. "You don't have suppliers. You don't have a work force. You don't have equipment. You have to sort of start from scratch."

Overlooked No More: James Sakoda, Whose Wartime Internment Inspired a Social Science Tool: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After documenting his experience in Japanese American internment camps, Sakoda helped bring the study of human behavior to the computer age.
This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
Unlike most of the 120,000 Japanese Americans detained in internment camps in the United States during World War II, James Sakoda had a mission: to document the experience of incarceration. He took about 1,800 pages of notes, largely in private, lest he be accused of being a traitor or a spy.
Those notes would form the basis of his 1949 dissertation on the dynamics of individuals and groups at one of these camps, the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. Tucked into Appendix B of the paper was possibly the first example of what is known as an "agent-based model" -- a simulation of how individual actions can add up to large-scale patterns.
The tool is essential in a wide variety of fields, and has helped social scientists, epidemiologists, financial regulators, city planners and wildlife experts do their work. During the coronavirus pandemic, for instance, agent-based models were essential for forecasting the spread of the virus and prioritizing vaccines for certain groups of people.
To develop the model, Sakoda used the home computing technology of the time: a checkerboard. Each checker was given a simple rule for movement, based on its immediate surroundings. By changing the rules even only slightly, Sakoda showed that the pieces could mingle freely, or they could quickly segregate by color.
Ecologists and environmentalists have used agent-based models to investigate the interactions between shipping boats and beluga whales in Canada's St. Lawrence River estuary; between humans and elephants in Tanzania; and between scuba diving tourism and coral reefs in Thailand. Transportation agencies use the models to predict how even minor changes, like expanding a bus stop, could affect the flow of traffic.
"James Sakoda was perhaps the first social scientist ever to apply computational modeling for unraveling the complexity of social processes," Andreas Flache, a sociologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said in an email.
Despite the widespread use of his model, Sakoda did not get much credit for his innovation.
James Minoru Sakoda, who was known as Jimmy, was born on April 21, 1916, on an alfalfa ranch in Lancaster, Calif., in northern Los Angeles County. His conservative Buddhist parents, Kenichi and Tazu (Kihara) Sakoda, were both from Japan.
After moving around the Los Angeles area, his parents took their four children to Japan, where James attended high school for three years and Tokyo University for another three.
With $ 100 in his pocket, Sakoda returned to California and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied psychology. It was during his second year there that the secretary of war established detention camps on the West Coast for Americans of Japanese heritage.
Sakoda was still at Berkeley when he began documenting Japanese-Americans' reactions to the crisis. Through a classmate, he met Dorothy Swaine Thomas, a sociologist who was recruiting soon-to-be-incarcerated fieldworkers for a project called the Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement Study.
All four Sakoda siblings were back in the United States by the time they were ordered to one of these camps; their parents remained in Japan during the war. Sakoda, his brother, George, and his sisters, Ruby and May, were initially incarcerated in 1942, at the Tulare Assembly Center in the San Joaquin Valley in central California.
"Soldiers stood watching with rifles and Tommy guns," Sakoda wrote in his journal, noting that tall grass poked through the asphalt floors of his barracks, and that the condition of the latrines was "open to criticism."
He went on to chronicle daily camp life for Thomas's project, always in a detached, analytical way. "I never talked about this happening to us," he told the historian Art Hansen in 1988. Instead, he said, he looked at it as, "It happened to them."
The study "gave him a sense of purpose," Hansen said in a phone interview. "He played a salvation sort of role for not only his community, but generally for American history."
The Sakoda siblings were later moved to the Tule Lake Relocation Center, near California's northern border, where James taught psychology to detainees and met his future wife, Hatsuye Kurose, who was known as Hattie -- the "smartest girl in my class," as he called her in a letter to Thomas.
James and Hattie then spent two years at the Minidoka camp in Idaho, where they married before returning to Berkeley shortly before the camp was closed in 1945.
Sakoda was working toward a Ph.D. in psychology at Berkeley when a fellowship took him to Harvard. It was there that he developed his checkerboard model, examining the interactions among various groups at the internment camps: the "clannish" Nisei; children of Japanese immigrants; more reclusive detainees; and camp administrators.
After earning his doctorate from Berkeley in 1949, he briefly taught at Brooklyn College, then joined the psychology faculty at the University of Connecticut. There he developed an interest in the potential of computing in studying human behavior.
In the summer of 1956, Sakoda learned to program on early IBM punch-card computers at M.I.T. Then, with his wife and their son, Bill, he moved to Providence, R.I., hired by Brown University, where he became the director of a social science computer laboratory.
At a time when the study of human behavior was largely isolated from computing, Sakoda pushed for better tools with which to merge the two; the checkerboard model, which he taught to students over the next three decades, was just one of them.
In 1963, he was invited to a summer institute at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., to trade ideas about modeling cognitive processes using computers. While there, he began developing his own computing toolbox for social scientists, calling it DYSTAL. A 1971 paper, "The Checkerboard Model of Social Interaction," modernized his 1949 model through computer-run simulations.
After retiring from Brown in 1981, Sakoda told Hansen, "I think the best thing I've done is the social interaction model, which solved the problem in social psychology of going from the individual level to the group level."
But in the 1990s and 2000s, as agent-based modeling became fundamental to studying infectious diseases and the movements of humans on a large scale, a different origin story emerged.
Thomas Schelling, a well-connected Harvard economist and White House adviser, was on a plane bound for Boston when he started noodling with Xs and Os moving along a line. It would eventually become a checkerboard model strikingly similar to Sakoda's. Schelling mentioned it in a 1969 RAND research report and expanded it into an article in 1971, shortly after Sakoda had published his, in the same journal.
Decades later, it was Schelling's article that became widely credited as the first in which the checkerboard model appeared.
It is possible that Schelling encountered the seed of the idea at RAND -- he completed a residency there a year after Sakoda visited. But when asked in a 2001 interview if the checkerboard model devised by Sakoda had influenced him, Schelling replied, "I have never heard of him."
In 2005, Schelling was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, with Robert J. Aumann, for "having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis." In a biographical statement accompanying the prize, Schelling wrote of the checkerboard model, "Without knowing it I was pioneering a field of study that later became known as 'agent-based computational modeling."'
In his later years, in Barrington, R.I., Sakoda focused on gardening, his family and a longstanding mathematical side interest: origami. His book "Modern Origami," published in 1969 and still in print, showcases his own designs and made him notable among enthusiasts. (He decorated his computer laboratory at Brown with his origami.)
His nephew Jim Kurose said in an interview that at family gatherings Sakoda "would usually go sit by himself quietly in the living room and take out his paper, and he'd start folding, and he would just keep kids absolutely entranced."
He died on June 12, 2005. He was 89.
Sakoda's agent-based modeling innovations are being rediscovered thanks to the research of Rainer Hegselmann, a philosopher and social scientist at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management in Germany. In a 2017 article in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, Hegselmann speculated that the timing of Sakoda's retirement, in 1981, before the personal computer became ubiquitous, may have led to the erasure of his achievement.
"Maybe that life punishes those that are late," he wrote. "But sometimes it punishes those that are early as well."
Sakoda, however, was "not much concerned with getting explicit credit for what he did," his son, Bill, a computer scientist, said in an interview.
Instead, he added in an email, "He worked magic for a lot of people very quietly."

U.S. Focuses on Invigorating ‘Chiplets’ to Stay Cutting-Edge in Tech

SAN FRANCISCO — For more than 50 years, designers of computer chips mainly used one tactic to boost performance: They shrank electronic components to pack more power onto each piece of silicon.
Then more than a decade ago, engineers at the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices began toying with a radical idea. Instead of designing one big microprocessor with vast numbers of tiny transistors, they conceived of creating one from smaller chips that would be packaged tightly together to work like one electronic brain.
The concept, sometimes called chiplets, caught on in a big way, with AMD, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, IBM and Intel introducing such products. Chiplets rapidly gained traction because smaller chips are cheaper to make, while bundles of them can top the performance of any single slice of silicon.
The strategy, based on advanced packaging technology, has since become an essential tool to enabling progress in semiconductors. And it represents one of the biggest shifts in years for an industry that drives innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and military hardware.
“Packaging is where the action is going to be,” said Subramanian Iyer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCLA who helped pioneer the chiplet concept. “It’s happening because there is actually no other way.”
The catch is that such packaging, like making chips themselves, is overwhelmingly dominated by companies in Asia. Although the United States accounts for around 12% of global semiconductor production, American companies provide just 3% of chip packaging, according to IPC, a trade association.
That issue has now landed chiplets in the middle of U.S. industrial policymaking. The CHIPS Act, a $52 billion subsidy package that passed last summer, was seen as President Joe Biden’s move to reinvigorate domestic chipmaking by providing money to build more sophisticated factories called “fabs.” But part of it was also aimed at stoking advanced packaging factories in the United States to capture more of that essential process.
“As chips get smaller, the way you arrange the chips, which is packaging, is more and more important and we need it done in America,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University in February.
The Commerce Department is now accepting applications for manufacturing grants from the CHIPS Act, including for chip packaging factories. It is also allocating funding to a research program specifically for advanced packaging.
Some chip packaging companies are moving quickly for the funding. One is Integra Technologies in Wichita, Kansas, which announced plans for a $1.8 billion expansion there but said that was contingent on receiving federal subsidies. Amkor Technology, an Arizona packaging service that has most of its operations in Asia, also said it was talking to customers and government officials about a U.S. production presence.
Packaging chips together isn’t a new concept and chiplets are just the latest iteration of that idea, using technological advances that help cram the chips closer together — either side by side or stacked on top of one another — along with faster electrical connections between them.
“What is unique about chiplets is the way they are connected electrically,” said Richard Otte, CEO of Promex Industries, a chip packaging service in Santa Clara, California.
Chips can’t do anything without a way to connect them with other components, which means they need to be placed in some kind of package that can carry electrical signals. That process starts after factories complete the initial phase of manufacturing, which may create hundreds of chips on a silicon wafer. Once that wafer is sliced apart, individual chips are typically bonded to a key base layer called a substrate, which can conduct electrical signals.
That combination is then coated in protective plastic, forming a package that can be plugged into a circuit board that is essential for connecting to other components in a system.
These processes originally required lots of manual labor, leading Silicon Valley companies to shift packaging to lower-wage countries in Asia more than 50 years ago. Most chips are typically flown to packaging services in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China.
Since then, packaging advances have gained importance because of the diminishing returns from Moore’s Law, the shorthand expression for chip miniaturization that for decades drove progress in Silicon Valley. It is named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, whose 1965 paper described how rapidly companies had doubled the number of transistors on a typical chip, which improved performance at a lower cost.
But these days, smaller transistors are not necessarily cheaper, partly because building factories for leading-edge chips can cost $10 billion to $20 billion. Big, complex chips also are costly to design and tend to have more manufacturing defects, even as companies in fields like generative AI want more transistors than can currently be packed onto the biggest chips manufacturing machines allow.
“The natural response to that is putting more things in a package,” said Anirudh Devgan, CEO of Cadence Design Systems, whose software is used to design conventional chips as well as chiplet-style products.
Synopsys, a rival, said it was tracking more than 140 customer projects based on packaging multiple chips together. As much as 80% of microprocessors will use chiplet-style designs by 2027, according to the market research firm Yole Group.
Today, companies typically design all the chiplets in a package along with their own connection technology. But industry groups are working on technical standards so companies can more easily assemble products from chiplets that come from different makers.
The new technology is mostly used now for extreme performance. Intel recently introduced a processor called Ponte Vecchio with 47 chiplets that will be used in a powerful supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago.
In January, AMD disclosed plans for an unusual product, the MI300, that combines chiplets for standard calculations with others designed for computer graphics, along with a large pool of memory chips. That processor, intended to power another advanced supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has 146 billion transistors, compared with tens of billions for most advanced conventional chips.
Sam Naffziger, an AMD senior vice president, said it wasn’t a slam-dunk for the company to bet its chip business for server computers on chiplets. Packaging complexities were a major hurdle, he said, which were eventually overcome with help from an undisclosed partner.
But chiplets have paid off for AMD. The company has sold more than 12 million chips based on the idea since 2017, according to Mercury Research, and has become a major player in microprocessors that power the web.
Packaging services still need others to supply the substrates that chiplets require to connect to circuit boards and one another. One company driving the chiplet boom is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which already makes chips for AMD and hundreds of others and offers an advanced silicon-based substrate called an interposer.
Intel has been developing similar technology, as well as enhancing less-expensive conventional plastic substrates in an approach favored by some such as the Silicon Valley startup Eliyan. Intel has also been developing new packaging prototypes under a Pentagon program and hopes to win CHIPS Act support for a new pilot packaging plant.
But the United States has no major makers of those substrates, which are primarily produced in Asia and evolved from technologies used in manufacturing circuit boards. Many U.S. companies have also left that business, another worry that industry groups hope will spur federal funding to help board suppliers start making substrates.
In March, Biden issued a determination that advanced packaging and domestic circuit board production were essential for national security, and announced $50 million in Defense Production Act funding for American and Canadian companies in those fields.
Even with such subsidies, assembling all the elements required to reduce U.S. dependence on Asian companies “is a huge challenge,” said Andreas Olofsson, who ran a Defense Department research effort in the field before founding a packaging startup called Zero ASIC. “You don’t have suppliers. You don’t have a workforce. You don’t have equipment. You have to sort of start from scratch.”

Labor Victory in South With a Vote to Unionize: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Friday's victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor.
Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South.
The company, Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Ga., may lack the cachet of Amazon or the ubiquity of Starbucks, two other corporations that have attracted union attention. But the 697-to-435 vote by Blue Bird's workers to join the United Steelworkers was the first significant organizing election at a factory receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by President Biden.
"This is just a bellwether for the future, particularly in the South, where working people have been ignored," Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Friday evening after the vote. "We are now in a place where we have the investments coming in and a strategy for lifting up wages and protections for a good high-road future."
The three bills making up that investment include a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change.
Each of the bills included language to help unions expand their membership, and Blue Bird's management, which opposed the union drive, had to contend with the Democrats' subtle assistance to the Steelworkers.
Blue Bird stands to benefit from the new federal funds. Last year, it hailed the $ 500 million that the Biden administration was providing through the infrastructure bill for the replacement of diesel-powered school buses with zero- and low-emission buses. Georgia school systems alone will get $ 51.1 million to buy new electric buses, but Blue Bird sells its buses across the country. Still more money will come through the Inflation Reduction Act, another law praised by the company.
But that money came with strings attached -- strings that subtly tilted the playing field toward the union. Just two weeks ago, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, pushed a demand on all recipients of federal subsidies to detail the health insurance, paid leave, retirement and other benefits they were offering their workers.
They also required the companies to have "committed to remain neutral in any organizing campaign and/or to voluntarily recognize a union based on a show of majority support." And under the rules of the infrastructure bill, no federal money may to be used to thwart a union election.
The Steelworkers union used the rules to its advantage. In late April, it filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against Blue Bird's management, citing $ 40 million in rebates the company had received from the E.P.A., which stipulated that those funds could not be used for anti-union activity.
"The rules say if workers want a union, you can't use any money to hire anti-union law firms, or use people to scare workers," Daniel Flippo, director of the Steelworkers district that covers the Southeast, said before the vote. "I'm convinced Blue Bird has done that."
Politicians also got involved. Georgia's two Democratic senators and southwestern Georgia's Democratic House member also subtly nudged the plant's management, in a union-hostile but politically pivotal state, to at least keep the election fair.
"I have been a longtime supporter of the USW and its efforts to improve labor conditions and living standards for workers in Georgia," the Democratic congressman, Representative Sanford Bishop, wrote of the United Steelworkers in an open letter to Blue Bird workers. "I want to encourage you in your effort to exercise your rights granted by the National Labor Relations Act."
Blue Bird's management minimized such pressure in its public statements, even as it fought hard to beat back union organizers.
"Although we respect and support the right for employees to choose, we do not believe that Blue Bird is better served by injecting a labor union into our relationship with employees," said Julianne Barclay, a spokeswoman for the company. "During the pending election campaign, we have voiced our opinion to our employees that a union is not in the best interest of the company or our employees."
Friday's union victory has the labor movement thinking big as the federal money continues to flow, and that could be good for Mr. Biden and other Democrats, especially in the pivotal state of Georgia.
"Workers at places like Blue Bird, in many ways, embody the future," Mr. Flippo said after the vote, adding, "For too long, corporations cynically viewed the South as a place where they could suppress wages and working conditions because they believed they could keep workers from unionizing."
The Blue Bird union shop, 1,400 workers strong, will be one of the biggest in the South, and union leaders said it could be a beachhead as they eyed new electric vehicle suppliers moving in -- and potentially the biggest, most difficult targets: foreign electric vehicle makers like Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which have located in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina in part to avoid unions.
"Companies move there for a reason -- they want as smooth a path toward crushing unions as possible," said Steve Smith, a national spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "But we have federal money rolling in, a friendly administration and a chance to make inroads like we have never had before."
The Blue Bird plant, which rises suddenly off a rural highway lined with peach and pecan orchards, has long made it a practice to hire less educated workers, some of whom have prison records and most of whom start at $ 16 or $ 17 an hour, said Alex Perkins, a main organizer for the United Steelworkers in Georgia.
A union was a tough sell for such vulnerable workers against a management that was fiercely opposed, organizers conceded. Coming off the last shift of the day on Thursday, most workers declined to speak on the record. A clutch of about a dozen workers stood on Friday at the Circle K gas station across the street from the plant in the predawn darkness, holding pro-union signs as the first workers arrived to cast ballots under the gaze of National Labor Relations Board monitors.
But Cynthia Harden, who has worked at the plant for five years and voted in favor of organizing, did talk about the pressure workers were under to vote against it. Slide shows on the voting process, which showed ballots marked "no," said that the company could go broke if the union won, and there was a sudden appearance of food trucks at lunch and banners on the perimeter fence reading, "We Love Our Employees!"
"They've made some changes already, but if the union hadn't started, nothing would have happened," she said.
The letter that Georgia's Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, wrote to Matt Stevenson, Blue Bird's chief executive and president, was remarkably timid, praising the company for its cooperation and its well-paying jobs before "encouraging all involved, whatever their desired outcome, to make sure that the letter and the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act are followed."
Mr. Perkins fumed at that tone, considering the work that unions had put in to help Mr. Warnock win re-election last year. "I won't forget it next time," he said.
Both senators declined requests to comment on the election.

Full text: One of the longest-lasting cast members of any soap opera, she earned four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for her portrayal of a loving but tough nurse.
Jacklyn Zeman, an Emmy-nominated actress who for nearly a half-century played the role of the nurse Bobbie Spencer on the long-running soap opera "General Hospital," died on Tuesday in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 70.
Her family said that her death, at Los Robles Regional Medical Center, came after a "short battle" with cancer.
As Barbara Jean Spencer, better known as Bobbie, Ms. Zeman was among the longest-lasting cast members of any soap opera. She first appeared on "General Hospital" in 1977 and was seen in nearly 900 episodes of the show, which since 1963 has centered on the lives of characters who work in a hospital and in the wealthy business community in the fictional New York State town of Port Charles.
Bobbie was originally a student nurse who had moved on from her past life as a prostitute and given up a baby for adoption in Florida, and who vied for the affections of a law student named Scotty Baldwin. She was the younger sister of Luke Spencer, played by Anthony Geary, another of the show's most popular characters.
Ms. Zeman portrayed Bobbie as a loving but tough nurse who had emerged from a difficult past. In one scene, she defended her hard-knocks upbringing, telling Scotty that she never had anything handed to her.

"I wanted Bobbie to be bouncy and have a positive aura and energy," she said in an interview last year with TV Insider. "I wanted her to have intelligence, humor and a love of people. Bobbie came from a dysfunctional background, but she wanted to have kids and be a mother."
"I wanted the character to be perky," she said, "and to come in like a hurricane."
Ms. Zeman was nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards for her work on the show and received a fifth nomination in 2021 for another soap opera, "The Bay."
Jacklyn Lee Zeman was born on March 6, 1953, in Englewood, N.J., and grew up in Bergenfield. She was the oldest of three daughters of Richard Zeman, an engineer with IBM, and Rita (Duhart) Zeman, who worked for Scholastic magazine.
She began training in ballet at age 5, her daughter Cassidy Zee Macleod said, and at 15 moved to New York City, where she pursued dancing and briefly attended New York University. She was a cast member of the soap opera "One Life to Live" in 1976 before her move to "General Hospital" the next year.
In addition to Ms. Macleod, Ms. Zeman, who lived in Calabasas, Calif., is survived by another daughter, Lacey Rose Gorden; two sisters, Lauren Fischetti and Carol Kolb; and two grandchildren. Her marriages to the disc jockey Murray Kaufman (known professionally as Murray the K), Steve Gribbin and Glenn Gorden, the father of her daughters, ended in divorce.
In April, "General Hospital" celebrated 60 years on the air. Ms. Macleod said that one of her mother's last appearances was on an episode that month featuring a nurses' ball.
The show's executive producer, Frank Valentini, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, "Just like her character, the legendary Bobbie Spencer, she was a bright light and true professional that brought so much positive energy with her to work."
Ms. Macleod said that her mother adored the "strong-willed" role of Bobbie, and that she and her sister saw how deeply their mother's role had affected people when some of the nurses caring for her described how Bobbie had inspired them.
"We recognized how many lives she touched," said Ms. Macleod. "They said they became nurses because of her."

BTS Plans To Publish Oral History Of the Group: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The announcement by their U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, came after days of frantic speculation by their fervent fans.
The K-pop juggernaut BTS will release an oral history of the group in South Korea and the United States on July 9, its U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, said on Thursday.
The book, "Beyond The Story: 10-Year Record of BTS," was written by the journalist Myeongseok Kang and members of the group, and it will be published in South Korea by Big Hit Music.
The news confirms intense fan speculation over several days that Flatiron would publish a nonfiction title about a pop culture phenomenon this summer. The rumor spread once booksellers in the United States noticed last weekend that a mystery title with a July 9 release date was coming. It had an initial print run of one million copies and required booksellers to sign an affidavit to stock copies on publication day.
Fans searched for clues of who the mystery author might be, zeroing in at first on Taylor Swift and citing her frequent use of the number 13 as evidence. (The book's original announcement was slated for June 13.) Swift had also highlighted the date July 9 in her most recent album announcement.
But June 13 and July 9 are also significant dates in the BTS community. The group debuted on the first date, and BTS's passionate fan base, Army -- which stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth -- was founded on the second. The book's release will coincide with the fan group's 10th anniversary.
As speculations mounted, preorders drove the still-untitled book up best-seller lists at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
The English translation of the book was led by Anton Hur, in collaboration with Clare Richards and Slin Jung. The U.S. edition will be 544 pages and contain exclusive photographs, according to Flatiron, and will have a first printing of one million copies.
The group's powerful, very online fandom has become famous worldwide, known for supporting the group by buying multiple versions of each physical release and running intricately coordinated social media campaigns. Devotees also assist each other by translating BTS content into English and other languages and providing robust fan communities.
It is difficult to overstate BTS's influence, in music and beyond. Last year, the seven members of the group -- RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook -- visited the White House to speak against anti-Asian American hate crimes.
Since 2013, BTS has released nine albums and six EPs and helped K-pop become a dominant global force. In 2018, the group became the first K-pop act to hit No. 1 on Billboard's album chart with "Love Yourself: Tear," a feat it repeated twice in 2019 with "Love Yourself: Answer" and "Map of the Soul: Persona" -- matching a record set by the Beatles.
In June 2022, after yet another No. 1 album -- the three-disc compilation "Proof" -- BTS released a video on social media announcing it was going on hiatus so its members could focus on solo creative projects. "I should be writing about what I'm feeling and the stories I want to tell," Suga said, "but I'm just forcefully squeezing out words because I need to satisfy someone." The clip drew more than 16 million views in two days. In October of last year, the group's label confirmed that its members would enlist in South Korea's military as required by law. Some of them already have.
The hiatus was devastating news not only for BTS's fervent fan base, but also for the entertainment business. The day after the news broke, the stock price for Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company behind the group, dropped 28 percent, which shaved $ 1.7 billion off its market value. As the group's popularity has grown, it has become a pillar of South Korea's economy, contributing $ 3.5 billion annually by 2020, according to the Hyundai Research Institute.
Many fans say that while they are drawn to BTS's music and performances, they are also inspired by its messages of love and acceptance, which have led some to become more politically active. "They're really, really passionate people who just fight for what they love," Nicole Santero, a fan who ran a data-focused BTS Twitter account, told The Times in 2020. "Those characteristics translate well when you look at social issues."

Roy Saltman, 90, Who Warned About Hanging Chads, Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He foresaw the problems with punch-card ballots that benumbed the nation after Florida's chaotic vote in the 2000 presidential election. His warnings went largely unheeded.
Roy G. Saltman, the federal government's leading expert on computerized voting whose overlooked warning about the vulnerability of punch-card ballots presaged the hanging chad fiasco in Florida that came to symbolize the disputed recount in the 2000 presidential election, died on April 21 in Rockville, Md. He was 90.
His death, in a nursing home, was caused by complications of recent strokes, his grandson Max Saltman said.
In a 132-page federal report published in 1988 and distributed to thousands of local voting officials across the country, Mr. Saltman, an analyst working for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, cautioned that the bits of cardboard that voters were supposed to punch out from their ballots, known as chads, might remain partly attached (hence, hanging), or pressed back into the card when the votes were counted.
Either event would render the voter's choice uncertain or, if the ballot appeared to be picking more than one candidate, invalid.
"It is recommended," Mr. Saltman said flatly, "that the use of pre-scored punch card ballots be ended."
His recommendation was largely ignored, certainly in Florida, where the initial count in the 2000 election gave the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a 1,784-vote lead over the Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, a margin so close that state law required a recount.
Armies of lawyers and political operatives descended on Florida, suits and countersuits were filed, and recounts were started and stopped in various counties. The spectacle of election workers examining punch-card ballots through magnifying glasses, to try to determine a voter's intent, popularized the term hanging chad as it raised doubts about the accuracy of the count.
After five weeks of recounts, the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in on Dec. 12, 2000, and, in a 5-to-4 decision, stopped a state court-ordered recount, with Mr. Bush holding a 537-vote lead over Mr. Gore. Florida's 25 Electoral College votes, and the presidency, were awarded to Mr. Bush.
"It has always puzzled me why my report never got a wider acceptance," Mr. Saltman told USA Today in 2001. "It takes a crisis to move people, and it shouldn't have."
The counting crisis that crippled the presidential transition in 2000 prompted congressional hearings that led in 2002 to the Help America Vote Act, which outlawed the use of punch cards in federal elections.
As recently as last month, Fox News agreed to pay $ 787.5 million to resolve a defamation suit filed by Dominion Voting Systems after Fox TV personalities falsely claimed that Dominion's voting machines were susceptible to hacking and had switched votes in the 2020 election from President Donald J. Trump to Joseph R. Biden Jr. The company's patents cite Mr. Saltman's early reports on punch-card vulnerabilities as proof that Dominion's voting technology had overcome those flaws.
As early as 1976, Mr. Saltman warned that "we have a serious problem of public confidence in computers and a serious problem of public confidence in public officials, and around election time they tend to coalesce."
When his bosses at the federal agency discounted his early concerns, Mr. Saltman got a $ 150,000 grant to study voting mishaps around the country.
He found a report that reviewed Detroit's first punch-card voting experience in a 1970 primary election. It turned up "design inadequacies of the voting device" that had invalidated ballots because voters had unintentionally voted for more than the prescribed number of candidates. Similar concerns about punch-card voting were raised after a 1984 election for property appraiser in Palm Beach County, Fla.
In 1988, Mr. Saltman's prescient report, "Accuracy, Integrity and Security in Computerized Vote Tallying," recommended banning the pre-scored punch-card voting machines that would create the counting crisis in Florida in 2000.
He also recommended against the use of computer systems that would prevent voters from examining their ballots for accuracy before leaving the polls, and that would not produce an immediate printed paper trail for election officials to examine in a recount.
"The defects in the pre-scored punch card voting system are fundamental and cannot be fixed by engineering or management alterations," Mr. Saltman wrote. He added that "manual examination of pre-scored punch card ballots to determine the voter's intent is highly subjective."
"For example," he continued, "manual counters are forced to determine whether a pinprick point on a chad demonstrated an intent to register a vote."
Max Saltman said his grandfather had expressed concern that nearly all electronic voting systems in the United States still relied on complex operating systems, despite his warnings about their vulnerabilities.
Charles Stewart III, an M.I.T. professor of political science who consulted with Mr. Saltman, said by email: "Roy appreciated how computers could help to make election administration better, by automating vote counting, which is a very tedious and error-prone exercise when done by hand. But, he demonstrated that these machines sometimes broke down, and it was foolish not to design systems that took this fact into account."
Roy Gilbert Saltman was born on July 15, 1932, in Manhattan to Ralph Henry Saltman, a son of immigrants from Russia, and Josephine (Stern) Saltman, who had immigrated from Budapest as an infant. His father was a production manager in the garment industry and later at an electrical appliance factory. His mother was a homemaker.
Raised in the Bronx and in Sunnyside, Queens, Roy graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School.
He earned a degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., in 1953. In 1955, he received a master's in engineering from M.I.T., where he worked on the guidance systems for the Nautilus, the first nuclear submarine. He also studied engineering at Columbia University and was granted a master's degree in public administration from the American University in Washington in 1976.
In 1969, after jobs at Sperry Gyroscope Co. and IBM, he joined the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he worked on software policy and served on the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, the agency charged with maintaining the uniform usage of geographic names within the federal government.
His first marriage, to Lenore Sack, ended in divorce. In 1992, he married Joan Ettinger Ephross. She died in 2008.
In addition to his grandson Max, he is survived by his sons, David and Steven, and a daughter, Eve, from his marriage to Dr. Sack; his stepchildren, David, Peter and Sara; two other grandchildren; and six step-grandchildren.
After he retired in 1996, Mr. Saltman became an election consultant.
The belated attention his reports received after the 2000 election, in part as a result of his testimony to the House Committee on Science in May 2001, prompted him to write what became a definitive book, "The History and Politics of Voting Technology" (2006).
He also continued to speak out on election issues. In a letter to The Washington Post in 2005, he warned that Georgia's requirement that voters have a photo ID card, at a cost of $ 20 every five years, might violate the Constitution's prohibition of a poll tax.
As Sue Halpern wrote in The New Yorker in 2020, plenty of potential problems with electronic voting machines that Mr. Saltman identified remain: "tallies that can't be audited because the voting machines do not provide a paper trail, software and hardware glitches, security vulnerabilities, poor connections between voting machines and central tabulating computers, conflicts of interest among vendors of computerized systems, and election officials who lack computer expertise."
Mr. Saltman often said that there was no margin of error in voting, that civic engagement and confidence in the electoral system was too vital to a democracy to leave any grounds for misgivings.
"An election is like the launch of a space rocket," he often said. "It must work the first time."

The U.S. Needs to Regulate A.I.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's both exciting and unsettling to have a realistic conversation with a computer. Thanks to the rapid advance of generative artificial intelligence, many of us have now experienced this potentially revolutionary technology with vast implications for how people live, work and communicate around the world. The full extent of generative A.I.'s potential is still up for debate, but there's little doubt it will be highly disruptive.
The last time we found ourselves facing such widespread social change wrought by technology was the onset of the Web 2.0 era in the mid-2000s. New, innovative companies like Facebook and Google revolutionized communications and delivered popular services to a fast-growing user base.
Those innovative services, however, came at a steep cost. What we initially conceived of as free services were monetized through extensive surveillance of the people and businesses that used them. The result has been an online economy where access to increasingly essential services is conditioned on the widespread hoarding and sale of our personal data.
These business models drove companies to develop endlessly invasive ways to track us, and the Federal Trade Commission would later find reason to believe that several of these companies had broken the law. Coupled with aggressive strategies to acquire or lock out companies that threatened their position, these tactics solidified the dominance of a handful of companies. What began as a revolutionary set of technologies ended up concentrating enormous private power over key services and locking in business models that come at extraordinary cost to our privacy and security.
The trajectory of the Web 2.0 era was not inevitable -- it was instead shaped by a broad range of policy choices. And we now face another moment of choice. As the use of A.I. becomes more widespread, public officials have a responsibility to ensure this hard-learned history doesn't repeat itself.
As companies race to deploy and monetize A.I., the Federal Trade Commission is taking a close look at how we can best achieve our dual mandate to promote fair competition and to protect Americans from unfair or deceptive practices. As these technologies evolve, we are committed to doing our part to uphold America's longstanding tradition of maintaining the open, fair and competitive markets that have underpinned both breakthrough innovations and our nation's economic success -- without tolerating business models or practices involving the mass exploitation of their users. Although these tools are novel, they are not exempt from existing rules, and the F.T.C. will vigorously enforce the laws we are charged with administering, even in this new market.
While the technology is moving swiftly, we already can see several risks. The expanding adoption of A.I. risks further locking in the market dominance of large incumbent technology firms. A handful of powerful businesses control the necessary raw materials that start-ups and other companies rely on to develop and deploy A.I. tools. This includes cloud services and computing power, as well as vast stores of data.
Enforcers and regulators must be vigilant. Dominant firms could use their control over these key inputs to exclude or discriminate against downstream rivals, picking winners and losers in ways that further entrench their dominance. Meanwhile, the A.I. tools that firms use to set prices for everything from laundry detergent to bowling lane reservations can facilitate collusive behavior that unfairly inflates prices -- as well as forms of precisely targeted price discrimination. Enforcers have the dual responsibility of watching out for the dangers posed by new A.I. technologies while promoting the fair competition needed to ensure the market for these technologies develops lawfully. The F.T.C. is well equipped with legal jurisdiction to handle the issues brought to the fore by the rapidly developing A.I. sector, including collusion, monopolization, mergers, price discrimination and unfair methods of competition.
And generative A.I. risks turbocharging fraud. It may not be ready to replace professional writers, but it can already do a vastly better job of crafting a seemingly authentic message than your average con artist -- equipping scammers to generate content quickly and cheaply. Chatbots are already being used to generate spear-phishing emails designed to scam people, fake websites and fake consumer reviews --bots are even being instructed to use words or phrases targeted at specific groups and communities. Scammers, for example, can draft highly targeted spear-phishing emails based on individual users' social media posts. Alongside tools that create deep fake videos and voice clones, these technologies can be used to facilitate fraud and extortion on a massive scale.
When enforcing the law's prohibition on deceptive practices, we will look not just at the fly-by-night scammers deploying these tools but also at the upstream firms that are enabling them.
Lastly, these A.I. tools are being trained on huge troves of data in ways that are largely unchecked. Because they may be fed information riddled with errors and bias, these technologies risk automating discrimination -- unfairly locking out people from jobs, housing or key services. These tools can also be trained on private emails, chats and sensitive data, ultimately exposing personal details and violating user privacy. Existing laws prohibiting discrimination will apply, as will existing authorities proscribing exploitative collection or use of personal data.
The history of the growth of technology companies two decades ago serves as a cautionary tale for how we should think about the expansion of generative A.I. But history also has lessons for how to handle technological disruption for the benefit of all. Facing antitrust scrutiny in the late 1960s, the computing titan IBM unbundled software from its hardware systems, catalyzing the rise of the American software industry and creating trillions of dollars of growth. Government action required AT&T to open up its patent vault and similarly unleashed decades of innovation and spurred the expansion of countless young firms.
America's longstanding national commitment to fostering fair and open competition has been an essential part of what has made this nation an economic powerhouse and a laboratory of innovation. We once again find ourselves at a key decision point. Can we continue to be the home of world-leading technology without accepting race-to-the-bottom business models and monopolistic control that locks out higher quality products or the next big idea? Yes -- if we make the right policy choices.
Lina M. Khan is the chair of the Federal Trade Commission.

Ford Motor Made $1.8 Billion As Shortage of Parts Eased: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales increased from a year earlier, when the automaker was hampered by parts shortages.
Ford Motor reported a solid profit in the first quarter, although the automaker indicated that its turnaround was not complete and that it had a ways to go before it starts making money on electric vehicles.
On Tuesday, the company said it made $ 1.8 billion in profit in the first three months of 2023 as a result of a substantial increase in revenue and in the number of vehicles it sold around the world, the company said Tuesday.
The positive result is a recovery from the same period a year ago, when the automaker lost $ 3.1 billion as the value of its stake in the electric-vehicle maker Rivian declined.
In 2022, Ford was slowed by shortages of computer chips and other key parts that prevented it from making as many vehicles as it had expected.
"When you look at the core and the quarter, it's solid," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a conference call with analysts. "We saw growth across all our key metrics. Our balance sheet is strong."
For the first quarter, the company reported revenue of $ 41.5 billion, up 20 percent from $ 34.5 billion in the year-earlier period. Globally, Ford sold 1.1 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, compared with 966,000 in the first three months of 2022.
Ford, which is trying to streamline its operations and cut costs, reiterated a forecast of $ 9 billion to $ 11 billion in profit for the full year before interest and taxes.
For the first time, Ford reported separate results for its electric vehicle division. The E.V. business lost $ 700 million before interest and taxes in the first quarter, while a unit making traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles doubled its profit to $ 2.6 billion.
The E.V. business is not yet producing vehicles in sufficient volumes to generate profits. It was especially slowed in the first quarter, when the company halted production of the F-150 Lightning pickup to fix a battery defect and stopped making the Mustang Mach-E, a sport-utility vehicle, to modify its plant to roughly double output.
The production disruptions caused Ford's sales of the Mach-E to fall about 20 percent, to just under 5,400 vehicles. Sales of the F-150 Lightning totaled almost 4,300 trucks. That was higher than a low figure from a year ago, when the truck was just going into production, but fewer than Ford had been hoping for.
Separately on Tuesday, Ford said it was lowering prices of most versions of the Mach-E by $ 3,000 to $ 4,000. The vehicle, introduced two years ago, now competes with similar electric S.U.V.s from Hyundai, Volkswagen, Nissan, Tesla and other manufacturers.
"It's a competitive segment," Mr. Farley said.
Mr. Farley said that over the course of this year, Ford would narrow its losses on those two vehicles and the E-Transit, a delivery van. He also predicted that those three models would be profitable before interest and taxes by the end of 2024.
A third line of business, Ford Pro, which produces commercial trucks and services for fleet operators, nearly tripled its earnings before interest and taxes to $ 1.4 billion.
In the past, Ford broke out its operations geographically. The new form of reporting is intended to show how fast the company's E.V. business is growing, in hopes of attracting investors.
Ford plans to give investors a closer look at its strategy and operations in a two-day conference this month.
The earnings announcement came after the markets closed. Ford shares were down about 2 percent in extended trading.

Full text: After matching on Hinge, Nick Matcheck and Lori Hu waited three months before meeting in person. By then, they had already decided to live together in Wisconsin.
Nicholas Brandon Matcheck arrived with a single red rose the first time he met Chunyu Hu face to face in June 2020 on a grand marble staircase in the lobby of the Kimpton Gray Hotel in Chicago.
"There was no initial shyness," said Mr. Matcheck, 40, who described their first kiss minutes later as "very natural."
He had boarded a nearly empty plane in San Francisco that morning, with a one-way ticket and a suitcase, for a weeklong stay in Chicago with Ms. Hu before they moved in together in Green Bay, Wis.
"I already knew what kind of person and partner he was going to be," said Ms. Hu, 38, who had matched with him three months earlier on the dating app Hinge while working remotely from her parents' house in Green Bay -- a temporary move during the Covid-19 lockdown after she felt hemmed in working from her small one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco.
Ms. Hu, who goes by Lori, came to the United States to be with her parents when she was 3 from a village outside Guangzhou, China. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering and a master's in engineering management, both from Duke. She then received a joint master's in international studies and business administration from the University of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Hu, now a managing director at Vertex Ventures Healthcare, a life sciences venture capital fund based in San Francisco, often rolled her eyes during video meetings as she and her co-workers weighed in on the latest episodes of the Netflix reality show "Love Is Blind."
"It just felt so unbelievable," said Ms. Hu, who was skeptical of couples who can develop relationships and become engaged before actually seeing each other.
Her tune changed somewhat when one of her first Hinge matches in March 2020 was Mr. Matcheck.
Mr. Matcheck, whose previous marriage ended in divorce, was completing a master's in business administration at the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated cum laude with a bachelor's in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, and also received a master's in international affairs from the University of California, San Diego.
From 2007 to 2016, Mr. Matcheck, who goes by Nick, was a naval aviator. He flew a Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, in the U.S. Navy, and was deployed to the Middle East and Latin America. A son of an Air Force fighter pilot, he was born in Madrid and is now based in San Francisco as a product manager at Supernal, Hyundai's advanced air mobility subsidiary.
They began speaking daily and bonded over '90s music like Savage Garden's "I Knew I Loved You." Their virtual dates included watching nostalgic films that hit home like "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Sleepless in Seattle," and they soon even began exchanging good, old-fashioned love letters.

Though they had exchanged photos from their lives, "we didn't want to do FaceTime or video," said Ms. Hu, explaining that they wanted to save that 'aha!' moment for when they met face to face.
The couple planned a picnic by the Golden Gate Bridge for late April 2020, when Ms. Hu was set to return to San Francisco, which did not come to pass. On April 22, the night before her birthday, her father was rushed to the I.C.U. with Covid, and then her mother was also infected and hospitalized for a week.
"Nick would talk me through the night," said Ms. Hu, who sometimes dozed off on the phone.
She and her mother, who recovered after a couple of weeks, often stood outside the hospital to be close to her father. After 30 days in the I.C.U., her father died on a muggy day in May.
"You never know what happens in life," she said, quoting one of the last things her father told her.
In a surprise twist, after Mr. Matcheck graduated that spring and his lease was up, the Civil War-era brick country house Ms. Hu's family owned and rented out became available.
"We spoke about if it made sense for him to move to Wisconsin," she said. "He was onboard."
Mr. Matcheck soon took care of packing up his and Ms. Hu's apartments in San Francisco and put their furniture into storage.
"By the time I saw her apartment, I already knew I was in love with her," he said. "I ate the soup she froze, saw her artwork and arts and crafts," he added. "I respackled her walls."
When they finally met in Chicago, she described it as "a week of firsts," a sort of "rom-com montage," and she had already prepared a picnic for the second day.
"It was a surreal feeling meeting someone you already know and you're in love with," she said.
In January 2022, they moved back to San Francisco.
A few days after Thanksgiving that year, when they put up a Christmas tree, he slipped a ring onto her homemade gingerbread-people ornaments featuring their names. The ring went undetected all day.
That evening he prompted her to check out the battery-powered star atop the tree. As soon as she noticed the ring, Mr. Matcheck, who had made coq au vin to celebrate, was on one knee.
On April 16, Dr. Ling Bei, the bride's best friend, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion, officiated the wedding before 80 guests at Viansa Winery in Sonoma, Calif. Ms. Hu's brother played Pachelbel's "Canon in D Major" on the violin as she walked down the aisle.
"It reminded me of her walking down the staircase in Chicago," Mr. Matcheck said. "It had that same speed, the slow deliberate walk. It's the same feeling. I knew it was the life I wanted then. I made the right decision again."

Full text: A "living laboratory" for climate solutions will rise on the idyllic 172-acre island off Lower Manhattan, led by Stony Brook University.
In the two decades since the federal government turned over control of Governors Island to New York City, city officials have sought an innovative way to use the 172-acre patch of land with stunning views of Lower Manhattan.
They have finally come up with an answer. On Monday, Mayor Eric Adams announced a $ 700 million campus dedicated to finding solutions to address the climate crisis.
The city chose a consortium led by Stony Brook University to transform one of the island's last big chunks of developable land into a 400,000-square-foot hub called the "New York Climate Exchange." The campus, which will focus on researching climate solutions and training for green jobs, is expected to open in 2028.
The climate hub will serve as a "living laboratory" that features resilient design, with renderings showing shiny sloped buildings covered in vegetation that are intended to evoke the hills of Governors Island. It will include two newly constructed classroom and research buildings on three acres of land that are currently undeveloped and will also make use of some historic buildings on the island. The existing public amenities will remain.
"It will truly be the first of its kind model for advancing research to accelerate the deployment of climate solutions that will help us with what I believe is the greatest threat of our time -- the climate crisis," Maria Torres-Springer, the city's deputy mayor for economic and work force development, said in an interview.
The idea for building a climate hub on Governors Island had been circulating for years. The island -- once an outpost of the Dutch West India Company and a Civil War prison for Confederate soldiers -- has become one of the city's public space marvels, with hammocks, vegetable gardens, vegan food trucks and the city's longest slide.
Not everyone was in favor of the project. Last December, a judge dismissed a legal challenge from a coalition that argued the new buildings would wreck the serenity of the island. An appeal is possible, but officials said they were confident that the city would win the case.
The car-free island is only reachable by ferry, and leaders have acknowledged that transportation was the "elephant in the room" for the project. As part of the new plan, the Trust for Governors Island will provide ferry service every 15 minutes, with a hybrid electric ferry expected to start service next summer. The campus will also include student and faculty housing and university hotel rooms.
The project follows a similar approach to the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, a graduate school that opened in 2017 and was championed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. But city officials refer to the Governors Island campus as "Cornell Tech on steroids."
The campus will create more than 2,200 jobs, city officials said, and eventually serve 600 college students, 6,000 job trainees and 250 faculty members and researchers every year.
Last week, Mr. Adams announced his broader environmental plan for the city, calling for a series of policies, including allowing the city to buy out residents who have homes in particularly flood-prone areas.
His plan aims to reduce emissions tied to city food purchases by 33 percent by 2030; establish citywide composting by the end of 2024; install solar panels and green roofs on all viable city-owned property by 2035; and protect New Yorkers from extreme heat by developing a "maximum summer indoor temperature policy" by 2030.
The city's first environmental blueprint, released by Mr. Bloomberg in 2007, included plans for the nation's first congestion pricing scheme, which is still a work in progress, and the planting of one million trees, which the city accomplished.
In 2003, the federal government turned over control of Governors Island to New York City under the condition that it not be used for commercial housing development. The new climate hub required a rezoning by the City Council in 2021, and three finalists were named last year as part of a global competition to lead the project.
Construction is expected to start in 2025. The winning consortium includes IBM, Georgia Institute of Technology, Pace University, Pratt Institute and Boston Consulting Group, in addition to Stony Brook University, which is part of the State University of New York system.
About $ 150 million in funding will come from previously allocated city capital funding, city officials said. Another $ 100 million is from the Simons Foundation, founded by the billionaire James H. Simons, and $ 50 million will be contributed by Bloomberg Philanthropies, founded by Mr. Bloomberg, a longtime supporter of rebuilding the island. The consortium will raise another $ 400 million and cover operational costs, and there will be no additional cost to New Yorkers, city officials said.
Maurie McInnis, president of Stony Brook University, said that the university had the "vision, expertise and commitment" to anchor the project. She praised the consortium model, which includes nonprofits and businesses.
"There's no one entity that's going to be able to solve climate change and come up with the solutions we're all going to need on its own," she said.

NEW YORK — In the two decades since the federal government turned over control of Governors Island to New York City, city officials have sought an innovative way to use the 172-acre patch of land with stunning views of lower Manhattan.

Credits and Debits of E.V. Shopping: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Buying an electric car has become much more complicated because of restrictions on which models qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $ 7,500.
Designed to accelerate the shift to electric cars among other climate goals, the Inflation Reduction Act has in practice made buying such vehicles a lot more complicated.
In August, the law ruled out the full tax credit of $ 7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids assembled outside North America. That may make it harder for consumers to take the financial or psychological leap to buy a battery-powered car.
The Treasury Department further tightened those rules this week by requiring that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in car batteries are sourced from the United States or in countries that are its trade allies -- numbers that will increase over time.
Just 11 electric cars from four automakers -- Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen -- now qualify for the full tax credit; several others can qualify for a partial $ 3,750 credit. The list is expected to grow as more automakers reconfigure their supply chains.
The rules are already driving big changes in the buying and selling of electric cars. Some automakers whose models are no longer eligible are now pushing leased electric cars. That's because the law allows leased vehicles to qualify as commercial vehicles, which the Inflation Reduction Act exempts from the restrictions that apply to cars bought by individuals.
For many car buyers, the availability of the tax credit is critical. Electric vehicle prices have fallen in recent months, but they still cost $ 58,940 on average in March, nearly $ 11,000 more than a typical new car, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Ethan Derner of Portland, Ore., and his fiancée, Lorien Sekora, share two Kia electric cars. Mr. Derner had considered replacing his car with a new model that could drive farther on a charge, but he gave up after realizing that the vehicles he wanted were either too expensive or no more practical than his current car. He has extended the lease on his Kia Soul and is waiting for more affordable models that can qualify for a tax credit.
"The only other model I'm considering now is a Rivian, but that's out of my price range," Mr. Derner said. Rivian's electric luxury models like the R1T pickup truck and R1S S.U.V. are built in Illinois and qualify for a $ 3,750 credit.
"Until I can drive to Seattle and back with no anxiety," Mr. Derner added, "I'm not going to buy a new E.V. outright."
His experience is common. About 80 percent of people who were shopping for an electric vehicle recently surveyed by Cars.com said tax credits played a big role in their decision to buy an electric car and the vehicle they planned to buy.
Many industry experts and consumers have praised the multipronged mission of the law to curb greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs in the United States and blunt China's dominance in batteries and mineral processing. Since President Biden took office, automakers, battery and other companies have announced plans to spend more than $ 100 billion to electrify the U.S. auto industry.
Yet the rules could hinder the goal of getting more people to buy electric vehicles -- at least for the next few years.
"They made it complex for a reason, but in the meantime it's creating all kinds of chaos for consumers," said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "In the short term, it's absolutely going to hurt the companies that aren't eligible and help the companies that are."
The reshuffled credits appear to deal an especially tough hand to Hyundai Motor, which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands.
Models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have won industry accolades and impressed buyers with attractive designs and some of the fastest charging times of any electric cars. But they are built in South Korea and, thus, not eligible for any federal tax breaks.
Even as sales of all Hyundai and Kia cars jumped in the first three months of the year, the brands' electric vehicle sales fell more than 25 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric car sales on the whole soared to another record in the first quarter, on a pace to top one million cars in 2023, and now account for 7.2 percent of all new cars sold.
The credit rules have been changing fast. Last month, Genesis' first American-built model, the Electrified GV70 sport utility vehicle, began rolling off a Hyundai line in Alabama after 16 hours of assembly. Genesis executives had hoped that the model could qualify for a credit, but the car did not meet the tougher rules the Biden administration released this week.
To make up for the loss of the tax breaks, Hyundai and other automakers are trying to lure buyers through leases. Under the administration's broad interpretations of the law, leased electric cars are eligible for tax credits even if they are made overseas and are not subjected to the government's rules on sourcing requirements for battery components and minerals, household income caps and vehicle price thresholds.
Car dealers can pass along the commercial credit to consumers by lowering the price of the car in lease transactions, which could reduce monthly payments. Under the rules of thumb for auto financing, applying the full $ 7,500 credit to a lease could save consumers about $ 225 per month over three years, or $ 125 per month over five years, said Russell Datz, a spokesman for Volvo.
Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, Sweden, sells two electric models in the United States that are made at a factory in Belgium and do not qualify for federal tax credits. The automaker will start assembling a new S.U.V., the EX90, at its factory in South Carolina this year.
Consumers are getting the money-saving message. In September, after the law's passage, just 7 percent of consumers leased an electric vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. By March, leases accounted for 34 percent of the electric car market.
Gary Murphy, a retired educator in Castle Rock, Colo., leased an Ioniq 5 in February from a dealer that learned of the commercial credit the day before.
"We had no plans to lease a car," Mr. Murphy said. "But when they confirmed you can get $ 7,500 on a lease, or nothing to buy, that's too big an incentive to pass up."
Before tracking down the Ioniq 5, he waited for months for three different electric models, which were in short supply. When cars were available, many dealers demanded several thousand dollars more than manufacturers' suggested retail prices.
"You can get the credit, but you can't get the car," Mr. Murphy said.
The use of credits for leased vehicles has angered some automakers and lawmakers who say it subverts the intent of Congress. Consumers can lease any electric vehicle for the $ 7,500 credit. For example, a couple making more than $ 300,000 -- the income limit for married people for the tax credit -- can lease a $ 148,000 Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS and claim a $ 7,500 credit even though the car is made in Germany and far exceeds the $ 55,000 price cap for electric sedans to qualify for the credit.
Treasury officials have said their decision to allow a tax credit for leased cars is legally sound. The Inflation Reduction Act exempted commercial vehicles from the restrictions to encourage rental car companies, local governments and other owners of car and truck fleets to buy electric vehicles.
Of course, many consumers prefer buying and owning cars, in part to avoid lease limits on how much they can drive and penalties for excessive wear and tear.
José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, insists the loss of buyer credits puts his brands at a huge marketplace disadvantage. But the chairman of Hyundai's national dealer council, Kevin Reilly, said models like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would remain competitive despite their financial handicap.
The Ioniq 6, which recently went on sale, is the longest-range and most energy-efficient mass-market electric car in the United States. It can be driven up to 361 miles on a full charge and gets the equivalent of 140 miles to the gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
"I think our customers will evaluate the full landscape, not just whether an E.V. qualifies for credit," said Mr. Reilly, the owner and president of Alexandria Hyundai in Virginia.
Mr. Reilly said leasing offered other advantages. People who are anxious about switching to battery-powered cars can try one without a long-term commitment or worrying about resale value. And as electric vehicle technology advances and more affordable models hit the market, customers can easily upgrade when their lease is up.
Still, some car buyers said they would buy only electric cars eligible for tax credits because they supported the aims of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Jonathan Quarles, an entrepreneur in Detroit, said he spent more than $ 150 per week to fill up a Ford Expedition to ferry his three daughters around town. He is considering replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is eligible for a $ 3,750 federal tax credit. After watching manufacturing jobs leave the country for decades, he said, he has little sympathy for automakers whose cars did not qualify for credits.
"My perspective is," he said, "you should have been building those factories way before the credit."

Designed to accelerate the shift to electric cars among other climate goals, the Inflation Reduction Act has in practice made buying such vehicles a lot more complicated.
In August, the law ruled out the full tax credit of $7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids assembled outside North America. That may make it harder for consumers to take the financial or psychological leap to buy a battery-powered car.
The Treasury Department further tightened those rules this week by requiring that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in car batteries are sourced from the United States or in countries that are its trade allies — numbers that will increase over time.
Just 11 electric cars from four automakers — Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen — now qualify for the full tax credit; several others can qualify for a partial $3,750 credit. The list is expected to grow as more automakers reconfigure their supply chains.
The rules are already driving big changes in the buying and selling of electric cars. Some automakers whose models are no longer eligible are now pushing leased electric cars. That’s because the law allows leased vehicles to qualify as commercial vehicles, which the Inflation Reduction Act exempts from the restrictions that apply to cars bought by individuals.
For many car buyers, the availability of the tax credit is critical. Electric vehicle prices have fallen in recent months, but they still cost $58,940 on average in March, nearly $11,000 more than a typical new car, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Ethan Derner of Portland, Oregon, and his fiancee, Lorien Sekora, share two Kia electric cars. Derner had considered replacing his car with a new model that could drive farther on a charge, but he gave up after realizing that the vehicles he wanted were either too expensive or no more practical than his current car. He has extended the lease on his Kia Soul and is waiting for more affordable models that can qualify for a tax credit.
“The only other model I’m considering now is a Rivian, but that’s out of my price range,” Derner said. Rivian’s electric luxury models like the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV are built in Illinois and qualify for a $3,750 credit.
“Until I can drive to Seattle and back with no anxiety,” Derner added, “I’m not going to buy a new EV outright.”
His experience is common. About 80% of people who were shopping for an electric vehicle recently surveyed by Cars.com said tax credits played a big role in their decision to buy an electric car and the vehicle they planned to buy.
Many industry experts and consumers have praised the multipronged mission of the law to curb greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs in the United States and blunt China’s dominance in batteries and mineral processing. Since President Joe Biden took office, automakers, battery and other companies have announced plans to spend more than $100 billion to electrify the U.S. auto industry.
Yet the rules could hinder the goal of getting more people to buy electric vehicles — at least for the next few years.
“They made it complex for a reason, but in the meantime, it’s creating all kinds of chaos for consumers,” said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. “In the short term, it’s absolutely going to hurt the companies that aren’t eligible and help the companies that are.”
The reshuffled credits appear to deal an especially tough hand to Hyundai Motor, which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands.
Models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have won industry accolades and impressed buyers with attractive designs and some of the fastest charging times of any electric cars. But they are built in South Korea and, thus, not eligible for any federal tax breaks.
Even as sales of all Hyundai and Kia cars jumped in the first three months of the year, the brands’ electric vehicle sales fell more than 25%, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric car sales on the whole soared to another record in the first quarter, on a pace to top 1 million cars in 2023, and now account for 7.2% of all new cars sold.
The credit rules have been changing fast. Last month, Genesis’ first American-built model, the Electrified GV70 sport utility vehicle, began rolling off a Hyundai line in Alabama after 16 hours of assembly. Genesis executives had hoped that the model could qualify for a credit, but the car did not meet the tougher rules the Biden administration released this week.
To make up for the loss of the tax breaks, Hyundai and other automakers are trying to lure buyers through leases. Under the administration’s broad interpretations of the law, leased electric cars are eligible for tax credits even if they are made overseas and are not subjected to the government’s rules on sourcing requirements for battery components and minerals, household income caps and vehicle price thresholds.
Car dealers can pass along the commercial credit to consumers by lowering the price of the car in lease transactions, which could reduce monthly payments. Under the rules of thumb for auto financing, applying the full $7,500 credit to a lease could save consumers about $225 per month over three years, or $125 per month over five years, said Russell Datz, a spokesperson for Volvo.
Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, Sweden, sells two electric models in the United States that are made at a factory in Belgium and do not qualify for federal tax credits. The automaker will start assembling a new SUV, the EX90, at its factory in South Carolina this year.
Consumers are getting the money-saving message. In September, after the law’s passage, just 7% of consumers leased an electric vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. By March, leases accounted for 34% of the electric car market.
Gary Murphy, a retired educator in Castle Rock, Colorado, leased an Ioniq 5 in February from a dealer that learned of the commercial credit the day before.
“We had no plans to lease a car,” Murphy said. “But when they confirmed you can get $7,500 on a lease, or nothing to buy, that’s too big an incentive to pass up.”
Before tracking down the Ioniq 5, he waited for months for three different electric models, which were in short supply. When cars were available, many dealers demanded several thousand dollars more than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices.
“You can get the credit, but you can’t get the car,” Murphy said.
The use of credits for leased vehicles has angered some automakers and lawmakers who say it subverts the intent of Congress. Consumers can lease any electric vehicle for the $7,500 credit. For example, a couple making more than $300,000 — the income limit for married people for the tax credit — can lease a $148,000 Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS and claim a $7,500 credit even though the car is made in Germany and far exceeds the $55,000 price cap for electric sedans to qualify for the credit.
Treasury officials have said their decision to allow a tax credit for leased cars is legally sound. The Inflation Reduction Act exempted commercial vehicles from the restrictions to encourage rental car companies, local governments and other owners of car and truck fleets to buy electric vehicles.
Of course, many consumers prefer buying and owning cars, in part to avoid lease limits on how much they can drive and penalties for excessive wear and tear.
José Muñoz, the CEO of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, insists the loss of buyer credits puts his brands at a huge marketplace disadvantage. But the chair of Hyundai’s national dealer council, Kevin Reilly, said models like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would remain competitive despite their financial handicap.
The Ioniq 6, which recently went on sale, is the longest-range and most energy-efficient mass-market electric car in the United States. It can be driven up to 361 miles on a full charge and gets the equivalent of 140 miles to the gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I think our customers will evaluate the full landscape, not just whether an EV qualifies for credit,” said Reilly, the owner and president of Alexandria Hyundai in Virginia.
Reilly said leasing offered other advantages. People who are anxious about switching to battery-powered cars can try one without a long-term commitment or worrying about resale value. And as electric vehicle technology advances and more affordable models hit the market, customers can easily upgrade when their lease is up.
Still, some car buyers said they would buy only electric cars eligible for tax credits because they supported the aims of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Jonathan Quarles, an entrepreneur in Detroit, said he spent more than $150 per week to fill up a Ford Expedition to ferry his three daughters around town. He is considering replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is eligible for a $3,750 federal tax credit. After watching manufacturing jobs leave the country for decades, he said, he has little sympathy for automakers whose cars did not qualify for credits.
“My perspective is,” he said, “you should have been building those factories way before the credit.”

Tech Pioneer Sees Way for U.S. to Lead on Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It has been six decades since Ivan Sutherland created Sketchpad, a software system that foretold the future of interactive and graphical computing. In the 1970s, he played a role in rallying the computer industry to build a new type of microchip with hundreds of thousands of circuits that would become the foundation of today's semiconductor industry.
Now Dr. Sutherland, who is 84, believes the United States is failing at a crucial time to consider alternative chip-making technologies that would allow the country to reclaim the lead in building the most advanced computers.
By relying on supercooled electronic circuits that switch without electrical resistance and as a consequence generate no excess heat at higher speeds, computer designers will be able to circumvent the greatest technological barrier to faster machines, he claims.
"The nation that best seizes the superconducting digital circuit opportunity will enjoy computing superiority for decades to come," he and a colleague recently wrote in an essay that circulated among technologists and government officials.
Dr. Sutherland's insights are significant partly because decades ago he was instrumental in helping to create today's dominant approach to making computer chips.
In the 1970s, Dr. Sutherland, who was chairman of the computer science department at the California Institute of Technology, and his brother Bert Sutherland, then a research manager at a division of Xerox called the Palo Alto Research Center, introduced the computer scientist Lynn Conway to the physicist Carver Mead.
They pioneered a design based on a type of transistor, known as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, which was invented in the United States. It made it possible to manufacture the microchips used by personal computers, video games and the vast array of business, consumer and military products.
Now Dr. Sutherland is arguing that an alternative technology that predates CMOS, and has had many false starts, should be given another look. Superconducting electronics was pioneered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s and then pursued by IBM in the 1970s before being largely abandoned. At one point, it even made an odd international detour before returning to the United States.
In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, read an article in the Russian newspaper Pravda describing an astounding advance in low-temperature computing made by Fujitsu, the Japanese microelectronics giant.
Mr. Gorbachev was intrigued. Wasn't this an area, he wanted to know, where the Soviet Union could excel? The task of giving a five-minute briefing to the Soviet Politburo eventually fell to Konstantin Likharev, a young associate professor of physics at Moscow State University.
When he read the article, however, Dr. Likharev realized that the Pravda reporter had misread the news release and claimed the Fujitsu superconducting memory chip was five orders of magnitude faster than it was.
Dr. Likharev explained the error, but he noted that the field still held promise.
That set off a chain of events through which Dr. Likharev's tiny lab was granted several million dollars in research support, making it possible for him to build a small team of researchers and, eventually, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, relocate to the United States. Dr. Likharev took a physics position at Stony Brook University in New York and helped start Hypres, a digital superconductor company that still exists.
The story might have ended there. But it appears that the elusive technology may be gaining momentum once more because the costs of modern chip making have become immense. A new semiconductor factory costs $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion and takes up to five years to complete.
Dr. Sutherland argues that rather than pushing on more expensive technology that is yielding diminishing efficiencies, the United States should consider training a generation of young engineers capable of thinking outside the box.
Superconductor-based computing systems, where electrical resistance in the switches and wires falls to zero, might solve the cooling challenge that increasingly bedevils the world's data centers.
CMOS chip making is dominated by Taiwanese and South Korean companies. The United States is now planning to spend almost one-third of a trillion dollars of private and public money in an effort to rebuild the nation's chip industry and regain its global dominance.
Dr. Sutherland is joined by others in the industry who believe that CMOS manufacturing is hitting fundamental limits that will make the cost of progress intolerable.
"I think we can say with some assurance that we're going to have to radically change the way we design computers because we really are approaching the limits of what is possible with our current technology based on silicon," said Jonathan Koomey, a specialist in large-scale computing energy requirements.
As it has shrunk the size of transistors to the size of just hundreds or thousands of atoms, the semiconductor industry has been increasingly bedeviled with a variety of technical challenges.
Modern microprocessor chips also suffer from what engineers describe as "dark silicon." If all the billions of transistors on a modern microprocessor chip are used simultaneously, the heat they create will melt the chip. Consequently, entire sections of modern chips are shut down and only some of the transistors are working at any time -- making them far less efficient.
Dr. Sutherland said the United States should consider alternative technologies for national security reasons. The advantages of a superconducting computing technology might first be useful in the highly competitive market for cellular base stations, the specialized computers inside cellphone towers that process wireless signals, he suggested. China has become a dominant force in the market for the current 5G technology, but next-generation 6G chips would benefit from both the extreme speed and significantly lower power requirement of superconducting processors, he said.
Other industry executives agree. "Ivan is right that the power problem is the big issue," said John L. Hennessy, an electrical engineer who is the chairman of Alphabet and a former president of Stanford. He said there were only two ways to solve the problem -- either by gaining efficiency with new design, which is unlikely for general purpose computers, or by creating a new technology that is not bound by existing rules.
One such opportunity might be to fashion new computer designs that mimic the human brain, which is a marvel of low-power computing efficiency. Artificial intelligence research in a field known as neuromorphic computing has previously used conventional silicon manufacturing.
"There is really the potential of creating the equivalent of the human brain using superconducting technology," said Elie Track, chief technology officer of Hypres, the superconducting company. Compared with quantum computing technology, which is still in early experimental stages, "this is something that can be done now, but regrettably the funding agencies haven't paid attention to it," he said.
The time for superconducting computing may not yet have arrived, partly because every time that the CMOS world seems about to hit a final obstacle, clever engineering has surmounted it.
In 2019, a team of researchers at M.I.T. led by Max Shulaker announced that it had built a microprocessor from carbon nanotubes that promised 10 times the energy efficiency of today's silicon chips. Dr. Shulaker is working with Analog Devices, a semiconductor maker in Wilmington, Mass., to commercialize a hybrid version of the technology.
"More and more, I believe you cannot beat silicon," he said. "It's a moving target, and it's really good at what it does."
But as silicon is nearing atomic limits, alternative approaches once again appear promising. Mark Horowitz, a Stanford computer scientist who has helped start several Silicon Valley companies, said he was unwilling to discount Dr. Sutherland's passion for superconducting electronics.
"People who've changed the course of history are always slightly crazy, you know, but sometimes they're crazy right," he said.

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

If It's Domestic and Electric, China's Car Buyers Want to Own It: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Domestic companies are now selling more vehicles than their multinational rivals, which have failed to keep up with Chinese consumers' demand for electric cars and S.U.V.s.
For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $ 290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $ 70,000 sport utility vehicle designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
"If you're sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury," said Mr. Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city's auto show next Tuesday. The country is now the world's largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China's giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China's car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country's dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells -- at home and abroad -- most of the world's electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars' electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80 percent of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
"Multinationals' market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment," said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 -- standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers -- many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies' joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and E.V.s have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold one million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany's Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. G.M. would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which G.M. has a 44 percent stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $ 4,800 to $ 21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China's domestic car companies rose to 52 percent in the last quarter of 2022, from 47 percent the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3 percent of the car market, up from 2.1 percent four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China's leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. G.M. plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
"The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and G.M. had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Mr. Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
"They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones," he said. "They don't even seem to be in the same age."
Car fashions change quickly in China. Mr. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 sport utility vehicle.
Unlike most large S.U.V.s on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle's hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Mr. Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the S.U.V. for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of "zero Covid" quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China's many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it's Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China. "You want to be closer to them -- the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles," he said. "Foreign automakers don't have the same halo now."

Challenges Could Stall Biden's E.V. Revolution: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The administration's push to supercharge E.V. sales must now surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges.
WASHINGTON -- Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country's transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8 percent of new cars and less than 2 percent of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Biden has promised to cut the nation's emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means the carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $ 7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $ 49,507 compared with $ 61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what's known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exit.
"This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades," said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. "Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently."
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes E.V.s make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up E.V. production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $ 50 billion between 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $ 3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than two million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are "high, if not very high," for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, "because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure."
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. "The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile," Mr. Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.
Manufacturers are funding their electric vehicle production now from substantial profits on their gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles. But maintaining profitability as they produce more electric vehicles and fewer gas-powered models will be a challenge, experts say.
General Motors has said it is not yet making money on its electric vehicles, and Ford recently said its electric division was set to lose $ 3 billion this year. Both companies hope to turn the corner as they ramp up production of electric models but are also trying to cut costs now, especially in view of the uncertain economy.
G.M. is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $ 2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its work force.
"Getting to 50, 60 percent E.V.s is certainly possible," said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. "But this isn't going to be easy. Not at all."
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
"We're making sales to early adopters and easy adopters but we need to get beyond them," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. "We have a long way to go."
The most basic hurdle is price.
The federal government will offer buyers up to $ 7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle for the next decade, depending on how much of the vehicle was made in the United States. But of the 91 unique electric vehicle models now on the market in the country, fewer than 40 qualify for the tax credits, Mr. Bozzella said.
Drivers are also worried about charging electric vehicles. There are currently 130,000 public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the White House. Under the 2021 infrastructure law, the government will spend $ 7.5 billion to build half a million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways. But a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need more than 2 million public charging stations by 2030, in addition to private home and garage chargers.
Doug Freeman, an insurance executive in Amesbury, Mass., is an obvious customer for an electric vehicle. He has a 140-mile round trip commute to work, and currently drives a Chevrolet Volt hybrid. "For me, the green side isn't number one on the priority list, but the savings on fuel from an electric vehicle would be a lot more than for the average consumer," he said.
But the model he covets, the Kia EV6, is not made in the United States and doesn't qualify for the $ 7,500 tax credit. "Without the credit, it's $ 50,000 to $ 54,000," Mr. Freeman said. "I've never paid more than about $ 33,000 for a car."
Electric vehicle makers are making use of one way to win over consumers: rentals. In 2021, Hertz, the car rental company, bought 100,000 Teslas, making E.V.s 20 percent of its fleet. Most other major car rental companies are also adding electric vehicles to their fleets.
"Rental cars are an excellent way to move E.V.s from niche to mainstream," said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. "It offers consumers a way to test-drive electric vehicles for a few days, see if they like them, see how they feel about range anxiety," he said.
By purchasing American-made electric vehicles such as Teslas, the rental companies receive $ 7,500 in tax credits per car. And the Biden administration has made it easier for the rental companies to resell the cars after a few years: buyers can receive up to $ 4,000 in tax credits for the used electric cars.
"Through the incentives and the new laws, the administration has put in place a lot of policies to help automakers get where this regulation says they need to go," Ms. Brinley of S&P Global said.
Even if companies can churn out affordable electric vehicles at a fast pace, and consumers get over range anxiety, the proposed regulations are certain to be hit with legal challenges or be subject to shifting politics.
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, called the regulations "a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on."
"As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains," Mr. Sommers said.
Former President Donald J. Trump relished rolling back the auto pollution regulations enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. A future president could do the same to the Biden regulations.
A group of Republican attorneys general, many of them from oil-producing states, has already challenged several of the Biden administration's climate polices, none of which are as ambitious as the proposed auto pollution regulations.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia suggested on Wednesday that the group would fight the newest proposals.
Steven G. Bradbury, who served as the chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration, said the regulations would amount to government overreach.
"They are using this established, longstanding statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal: the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles," said Mr. Bradbury, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. "This is clearly driven by the president's directive to achieve these results. I don't think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the uses of statutes in this way."
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, who also served as a climate adviser to President Barack Obama, argued that the Clean Air Act has been used successfully for years to compel polluting industries to invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.
"All of that is part of the normal course of how E.P.A. has set standards," she said.
But she conceded that it may not be seen that way by the current Supreme Court, consisting of six judges appointed by Republican presidents, including three named to the court by Mr. Trump.
"It is a court that is very unsympathetic to regulation of any kind, and particularly hostile to the E.P.A.," Ms. Freeman said.

WASHINGTON — Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country’s transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8% of new cars and less than 2% of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Joe Biden has promised to cut the nation’s emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means that carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $49,507 compared with $61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what’s known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exist.
“This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades,” said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. “Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently.”
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes EVs make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets.

One Man's Commute, Seen From the Back Seat: [Review]

Full text: This experimental film pulls together excerpts from 11 evening commutes, as a man drives from the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, toward the city's center.
The majority of "The Plains" is shot from a fixed position inside a car, roughly from the vantage point of a passenger in the middle of the back seat. As the movie opens, the car is parked at an office complex on a rainy day. A driver hops in. Over the next three hours, viewers will learn the intricacies of his evening commute -- the often-heavy traffic as he drives north on Blackburn Road or the slowdowns he might encounter when he makes a left to enter the freeway.
The highway will take him northwest from the suburbs toward central Melbourne, Australia, although the movie never shows him reaching his destination. "The Plains" excerpts 11 commutes, not always from the route's beginning. The drive always takes place around 5 p.m., judging from the car's clock, and the sun's height indicates the season. The driver, Andrew, periodically listens to the radio or makes phone calls. Because he wears earbuds, we can't hear much from the person on the other end.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There are occasional variations, as when, a little more than halfway through, Andrew stops to get gas. Some days he gives a lift to David, his colleague at a legal center. During one such ride, we learn from the men's dialogue that we've changed cars -- Andrew has replaced his previous Hyundai with a new one. (From the back seat, it's hard to tell.)
That David is, in fact, the film's director, David Easteal, hints that "The Plains" isn't a straight documentary. Easteal wrote a loose script based on his own rides with Andrew Rakowski, who also plays a version of himself. Their long conversations concern relationships, aging and death. Fans of structural film, "Jeanne Dielman" and Google Maps will find much to treasure, even if the narrative elements -- and occasional cutaways to imagery shot in a more remote area in western Victoria -- upset the movie's rigor and purposeful tedium.

Miami Beach Wants to Tame Spring Break for Good: [National Desk]

Full text: After a series of violent incidents, the city is moving to pre-empt late-night partying, but businesses worry about crimping their most profitable tourism season.
MIAMI BEACH -- After two fatal shootings on Ocean Drive over a March weekend, Miami Beach leaders followed their recent playbook for dealing with raucous spring break crowds: a state of emergency, a midnight curfew and limited liquor sales.
Then, in a new and drastic step, the city commissioners announced a curfew for 2024, a full year in advance, and declared spring break on the sun-kissed streets of Miami Beach to be over.
"Miami Beach is shutting the door on spring break, once and for all," Alex J. Fernandez, a city commissioner who sponsored a series of 2024 measures, said before the vote.
The decision, in the middle of the March and April season that is the most profitable time of the year for local businesses, has caused both relief and consternation over the possible loss of the throngs of visitors that have grown to overwhelm the city's police and other public services -- and of the money that those visitors spend on hotel rooms, nightclub cover charges and boozy cocktails.
Miami Beach both loves and hates its tourists, a conflicting sentiment that has long plagued officials as the city has evolved from a cocaine-cowboy den in the 1980s, to a high-fashion Riviera in the 1990s, to what it is today: a glittering playground for affluent families making a home, foreigners chasing the sun and young American visitors who come looking for a good time. Some people, including the city's mayor, want the partyers gone for good.
If Miami Beach is to be rebranded as less of a spring-break destination and more of an arts, culture and health and wellness hub, some owners of bars, nightclubs and liquor stores worry that they will lose business. And some residents and officials fear losing the diversity and laid-back vibe that make Miami Beach Miami Beach.
"What we're seeing is panic-stricken politicians who feel the need to do something," Ricky Arriola, a city commissioner who voted against the 2024 curfew, said in an interview. "The heavy hand of government is being imposed on residents, our visitors and businesses, rather than doing the hard work of coming up with really strategic alternatives."
Similar frictions between residents and visitors have afflicted other popular Florida spring break locales like Panama City Beach. Over time, Fort Lauderdale and other cities have pushed spring breakers out, in part by raising hotel rates and changing zoning laws to turn dive bars into more upscale establishments.
Miami Beach has been wrestling with its reputation as a party town. A judge recently upheld an ordinance imposing a partial 2 a.m. cutoff on alcohol sales for a South Beach neighborhood known as South of Fifth, now full of glimmering condos. The law had been challenged by Story, a nightclub that argued it could not survive if it could no longer sell alcohol until 5 a.m.
Patience has worn thin as spring-break revelers, often partying with alcohol or drugs, have packed a roughly 10-block stretch of South Beach along the Atlantic oceanfront each season, leading to unpredictable situations that sometimes turn violent because so many people have guns, according to city leaders, police officers and business owners.
The two deadly incidents this year took place over the St. Patrick's Day weekend, typically one of the busiest of the season. After the second, the city briefly imposed a midnight curfew.
Last year, two shootings on Ocean Drive led the city to set a midnight curfew. In 2021, Miami Beach made headlines when, while still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the city marketed itself to visitors even though many nightclubs remained closed, leading to raucous street parties. Officials responded that year by imposing an 8 p.m. curfew.
The rowdy behavior in the streets and the curfews that result have hurt businesses year after year, said Joshua Wallack, the chief operating officer of Mango's Tropical Cafe, an Ocean Drive institution for more than 30 years.
"When they go from a dangerous situation to complete lockdown, there is no business," he said. "We're just caught in the wake of how they handle it. The service industry and the hospitality industry, they get completely obliterated because it goes from having complete chaos to nothing."
In the past, civil rights activists have complained about the city police department's use of military-style vehicles, pepper balls and forceful crowd control tactics during spring break, which attracts many Black visitors to a city whose resident population is largely white. Glendon Hall, chairman of the Miami Beach Black Affairs Advisory Committee, which was created two years ago, was embedded with police officers and the city's "goodwill ambassadors" during spring break last month. He said in a statement that was read at a meeting on Tuesday that he was pleased with how law enforcement handled the "massive crowds" this year, and that there had been no major complaints from civil rights groups.
The Miami Beach Police Department made 573 arrests in March, a slight drop from 615 arrests in March 2022, according to Officer Ernesto Rodriguez, a department spokesman. Police officers seized more than 100 guns this year, he added.
In spite of the headlines about shootings and curfews, families, couples and small gaggles of friends strolled down the sidewalks of Ocean Drive on a Friday afternoon late last month. Marcus Benjamin, a 19-year-old college student from Chicago, said the city's emergency measures had "not at all" affected his trip with two of his buddies.
"I've seen a lot of cops on the beach," said one of his friends, Cameron Sasser, also 19. "But it's about the same as other years."
Still, most everyone in city leadership seems to agree that the chaotic spring-break crowds have become too much. But when it comes to what to do about them, views differ.
Mayor Dan Gelber said spring break "doesn't fit with a city that has so many residents."
"South Beach has bars and restaurants," he said, "but it also has elementary schools and churches and synagogues." Some local residents and visitors who spend lavishly often avoid the city during spring break.
Some commissioners like Mr. Fernandez have said they want to keep spring breakers, but not "lawbreakers" who follow them into the city.
"The worst thing that we can do is continue doing the same thing we've done now for several years in a row, which is knowing that we're going to have an overcrowding of our city and waiting until the violent situation occurs -- until the death occurs -- to react," he said in an interview. "It's better to get ahead of the situation and impose the curfew and the restrictions now."
In 2021, Miami Beach lost in court after the Clevelander Hotel sued the city over a law setting a 2 a.m. cutoff for alcohol sales. The judge ruled that the ordinance had not been properly enacted.
Under states of emergency during past spring breaks, increased regulations yielded little success in subduing the party scene, according to commissioners like Mr. Arriola, who would prefer to bring in a big organized event in March that would allow officials to set up barricades, ticketed entry and metal detectors around Ocean Drive roughly from Fifth to 15th Streets.
"At least people that are celebrating spring break in a street party on Ocean Drive could have the comfort of knowing that there wouldn't be any weapons in that area," he said.
After seeing crowds grow for nearly two decades at another busy time of year, Memorial Day weekend, the city began in 2017 to host the Hyundai Air & Sea Show, which features the military. The event has displaced many of the partyers who used to gather for Urban Beach Week, celebrating hip-hop.
This year, a three-day festival in March on Ocean Drive and in nearby Lummus Park drew daytime visitors and, the police department said, helped tame spring break -- but only until the festival's music and other entertainment ended at around 9 p.m. each day. Both of the shootings happened later at night.
Without a major event lined up for 2024, the city appears to be considering a spring break lockdown -- something Mr. Wallack said would go too far. Miami Beach should be able to offer a multitude of activities, from arts to wellness to nightlife, without having to sacrifice one for another, he argued.
"This is a city," he said.
And anyway, he added, "Good luck trying to lock down public beaches."

MIAMI BEACH — After two fatal shootings on Ocean Drive over a March weekend, Miami Beach leaders followed their recent playbook for dealing with raucous spring break crowds: a state of emergency, a midnight curfew and limited liquor sales.
Then, in a new and drastic step, the city commissioners announced a curfew for 2024, a full year in advance, and declared spring break on the sun-kissed streets of Miami Beach to be over.
“Miami Beach is shutting the door on spring break, once and for all,” Alex Fernandez, a city commissioner who sponsored a series of 2024 measures, said before the vote.
The decision, in the middle of the March and April season that is the most profitable time of the year for local businesses, has caused both relief and consternation over the possible loss of the throngs of visitors that have grown to overwhelm the city’s police and other public services — and of the money that those visitors spend on hotel rooms, nightclub cover charges and boozy cocktails.
Miami Beach both loves and hates its tourists, a conflicting sentiment that has long plagued officials as the city has evolved from a cocaine cowboy den in the 1980s to a high-fashion Riviera in the 1990s to what it is today: a glittering playground for affluent families making a home, foreigners chasing the sun and young American visitors who come looking for a good time. Some people, including the city’s mayor, want the partyers gone for good.
If Miami Beach is to be rebranded as less of a spring break destination and more of an arts, culture and health and wellness hub, some owners of bars, nightclubs and liquor stores worry that they will lose business. And some residents and officials fear losing the diversity and laid-back vibe that make Miami Beach Miami Beach.
“What we’re seeing is panic-stricken politicians who feel the need to do something,” Ricky Arriola, a city commissioner who voted against the 2024 curfew, said in an interview. “The heavy hand of government is being imposed on residents, our visitors and businesses, rather than doing the hard work of coming up with really strategic alternatives.”
Similar frictions between residents and visitors have afflicted other popular Florida spring break locales like Panama City Beach. Over time, Fort Lauderdale and other cities have pushed spring breakers out, in part by raising hotel rates and changing zoning laws to turn dive bars into more upscale establishments.
Miami Beach has been wrestling with its reputation as a party town. A judge recently upheld an ordinance imposing a partial 2 a.m. cutoff on alcohol sales for a South Beach neighborhood known as South of Fifth, now full of glimmering condos. The law had been challenged by Story, a nightclub that argued it could not survive if it could no longer sell alcohol until 5 a.m.
Patience has worn thin as spring break revelers, often partying with alcohol or drugs, have packed a roughly 10-block stretch of South Beach along the Atlantic oceanfront each season, leading to unpredictable situations that sometimes turn violent because so many people have guns, according to city leaders, police officers and business owners.
The two deadly incidents this year took place over the St. Patrick’s Day weekend, typically one of the busiest of the season. After the second, the city briefly imposed a midnight curfew.
Last year, two shootings on Ocean Drive led the city to set a midnight curfew. In 2021, Miami Beach made headlines when, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the city marketed itself to visitors even though many nightclubs remained closed, leading to raucous street parties. Officials responded that year by imposing an 8 p.m. curfew.
The rowdy behavior in the streets and the curfews that result have hurt businesses year after year, said Joshua Wallack, the chief operating officer of Mango’s Tropical Cafe, an Ocean Drive institution for more than 30 years.
“When they go from a dangerous situation to complete lockdown, there is no business,” he said. “We’re just caught in the wake of how they handle it. The service industry and the hospitality industry, they get completely obliterated because it goes from having complete chaos to nothing.”

General Motors Reports Raise in Quarterly Sales, Citing a Robust Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors and several rivals cited robust demand in the first quarter. But affordability is a growing challenge for many buyers.
Automakers have mostly overcome the supply-chain challenges that upended production early in the pandemic. Now they are trying to weather a new challenge: higher borrowing costs for their customers.
General Motors and several other automakers reported on Monday that new-vehicle sales increased substantially in the first three months of the year, thanks to improved supplies of key components and firm demand from both consumers and commercial customers.
But the steady interest rate increases in the last 12 months have raised questions about whether the industry can maintain its sales momentum throughout 2023.
Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at the market research firm Cox Automotive, said higher rates were already starting to put new vehicles out of the reach of buyers with lower incomes or weaker credit scores.
According to Cox, "subprime" borrowers -- those with weaker credit profiles -- make up just under 6 percent of all new-car purchases, down from 18 percent five years ago. Car buyers paid an average interest rate of 8.95 percent last month, up from 5.66 percent in March 2022.
The average monthly payment on new vehicles was $ 784 in February, compared with $ 681 a year earlier, Cox calculated.
"Affordability challenges are limiting access to the vehicle market," Mr. Smoke said. "Higher interest rates are having a huge impact."
Sticker prices have also challenged buyers. Auto prices -- for new and used vehicles alike -- have been a prominent driver of inflation over the last two years, although there are signs they are cooling off. The average price for a new car or light truck in February was $ 48,763, according to Cox -- up from $ 46,297 a year earlier, but down from $ 49,468 in January.
Mr. Smoke said automakers got off to a strong start in January and February, but saw credit tighten somewhat in March after the banking industry was shaken by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
G.M. said its new-vehicle sales in the United States rose 18 percent in the first three months of the year, to 603,208 cars and trucks. Sales to consumers rose 15 percent and sales to rental, corporate and government fleet customers increased 27 percent.
In the last several months, G.M. has been able to keep its factories humming as a result of steadier supplies of computer chips and other critical parts. The company ended the quarter with 412,285 vehicles in dealer stocks, up slightly from what it had at the end of 2022, but nearly 140,000 more than it had a year earlier.
Honda Motor reported that its U.S. sales increased 7 percent to 284,507 cars and trucks, while Nissan saw a gain of 17 percent, to 235,818. Hyundai said its U.S. sales rose 16 percent to 184,449.
Toyota Motor, however, has continued to suffered from parts shortages that have left its dealers with slim inventories. Its first-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 469,558 cars and trucks. Stellantis, formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, also reported a decline. Its sales fell 9 percent to 368,327 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is scheduled to report its latest sales figures on Tuesday.
G.M. has forecast a rapid increase this year in sales of electric vehicles; so far, it is off to an uneven start. The company sold 19,700 Chevrolet Bolt compacts in the first quarter, more than three times the total a year earlier, but other models have yet to make a splash.
Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric sport-utility vehicle, totaled just 968, and G.M. sold only two GMC Hummer E.V.s, down from 99 in the first quarter of 2022.
G.M. started production last summer at a new plant in Ohio that is supposed to provide battery packs for the Hummer E.V., the Lyriq and several other vehicles scheduled to arrive in showrooms this year. They include electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Chevy Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s.

How Big Tech Camouflaged Wall Street's Crisis: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The fate of the S&P 500 index -- used by investors as a barometer for the health of corporate America, and cited by presidents as a measure of their handling of the economy -- often comes down to just two companies: Apple and Microsoft.
This means it's hard to invest in the U.S. stock market, such as through a 401(k) or pension plan, and not be highly dependent on the fate of the two tech giants. More than $ 15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft's and Apple's market valuation.
It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath.
Trading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of a global investment bank in Europe sent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy, the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5 percent.
Apple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent.
It can be jarring for investors to see the index perform so differently from what they may have predicted, said Fiona Cincotta, a stock market analyst at StoneX, a brokerage.
"It's phenomenal that two companies can direct so much power within the S&P 500," she said. "These two companies seem to have been single-handedly directing the index."
It was true even at the height of the frenzy. On Monday, March 13, immediately after the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, signs of panic were everywhere: Several regional banks suffered their worst day ever in the stock market, with First Republic Bank down more than 60 percent, in conditions so chaotic that trading in many individual stocks was halted as stock exchanges tried to limit the damage.
Outside the stock market, government bond yields went haywire, oil prices slid and the dollar weakened, all showing that alarms about the economy were ringing on trading desks around the world.
Yet the S&P 500 spent much of the day in positive territory, and it ended with a barely noticeable decline of 0.1 percent. Credit, again, goes to Microsoft and Apple, which both rose enough to counter a 15 percent slide in the entire regional banking sector that day.
Much of this comes down to how the S&P 500 is designed. Its value is calculated by a measure that considers the overall market capitalization of a company. It means the stock moves of the largest companies carry the greatest weight, because even slight changes in their value create or destroy billions of dollars of shareholder value.
Apple, at roughly $ 2.4 trillion, and Microsoft, at $ 2.1 trillion, are so large that, taken together, the two companies would be the third-largest sector of the index, behind tech and health care. They would be larger than the energy sector and roughly the size of the financials sector.
This influence is a result of a decades-long shift in both the markets and the economy since the dot-com boom, a change that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates put in place to support the economy after the Great Recession made borrowing cheap and pushed investors to seek out higher returns from riskier companies, spurring financing and growth for tech companies. Apple and Microsoft excelled.
Apple in 2018 became the first American company valued at more than $ 1 trillion on the stock market. As its value inflated, so did that of its rivals Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) -- a group that came to be called the FANG stocks. They helped to lift the index to new highs over a more than decade-long bull market. Since then, Apple and Microsoft have become proportionally much larger, more than twice the size of the next largest company.
This dynamic is not wholly unusual in the history of the S&P 500, though it is extreme, and it has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of some tech companies through the pandemic. (At the end of 2018, Microsoft's and Apple's combined index weight was less than Apple's is today on its own.) The previous company to reach Microsoft's 6.2 percent weight in the index was IBM in the mid-80s, based on data for the end of each calendar year.
"I don't think it's a problem," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. "This is what the whole thing is worth, and if Apple or Microsoft go up or down, there is proportional impact because they are worth more. It's market-driven."
The S&P also produces an "equal weight" index, where each stock has the same effect on the wider group. In March, that index fell 2.6 percent.
Another commonly cited measure of Wall Street's performance, the Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index that has been criticized for how it emphasizes companies based on their share price alone.
And then there are the underlying sectors, which are also tracked in separate indexes by S&P. These indexes, which tend to more directly show pain afflicting their subsets of stocks, show that the financial sector fell almost 10 percent in March, while energy stocks dropped 0.5 percent and real estate companies slid 2.1 percent. They also show that other parts of the market -- like utilities -- fared just fine.
"There were so many sectors that underperformed and were in the red across the month, and that was completely pushed over and overshadowed by the gains in big tech," Ms. Cincotta said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the S&P 500 as well as the Dow, has tried to address the impact of these specific weightings, at least on different sectors. In 2018, it moved Alphabet and Meta out of the tech sector and into the communications category with Netflix, while leaving Amazon in the consumer discretionary category with other retailers.
Since then, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have slowly lost value, while Apple and Microsoft have grown. The technology sector in the S&P 500 has also been bolstered by the emergence of new behemoths like the chip maker Nvidia, which is valued around three quarters of a trillion dollars.
This month, S&P sought to rebalance the index again, moving a handful of large tech-oriented companies -- like Visa and PayPal -- into the financials sector, but further entrenching Apple and Microsoft's dominance as the two tech heavyweights.
Of course, this cuts both ways. In 2022, the S&P 500 slumped close to 20 percent, a drop that would have been much smaller without the lousy performance of the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft together accounted for roughly one-fifth of the index's total decline last year.
But for now, analysts see reasons for tech to continue to rally.
One reason is the excitement over artificial intelligence. Microsoft has a large stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and many investors foresee the nascent technology driving the next phase of growth for the companies developing the software as well as the chip makers whose processors power it.
Tech stocks are also benefiting from the concern over the country's banks, which has led investors to quickly cut back their expectation for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates, and absent an imminent recession, lower rates in the future would be a boost for the sector.
And, analysts said, large technology companies have become havens where investors can wait out the current storm.
"It's been a big bull cycle for tech," said George Catrambone, the head of Americas trading at DWS, a fund manager. "I don't think people will give up that paradigm easily."

Full text: The Biden administration hopes its guidelines for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits will encourage automakers to reduce their reliance on China for batteries and raw materials.
The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will significantly shorten the list of electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Officials hope the change will push carmakers to move their supply chains out of China and to the United States or its allies.
The rules, issued by the Treasury Department, are a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change by encouraging the use of zero-emission vehicles and green energy. The law also seeks to reduce the industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of critical raw materials.
For purchases of their electric cars to qualify for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits, automakers must meet strict requirements for where they assemble the cars and batteries and where they get the materials that go into batteries. Only a handful of vehicles are expected to qualify for the full credit when the rules, which are more stringent than previous requirements, go into effect April 18, down from 21 now.
The new rules, which could be revised in response to comments from the public, will require that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in each electric car's battery come from domestic sources or countries with which the United States has trade agreements.
The full list of qualifying cars will not be published for a couple of weeks, but Tesla has begun informing buyers that the changes would affect its lineup. The company said on its website that the least expensive version of its Model 3 sedan, one of the most popular electric cars, would no longer be eligible for the full credit. The car uses a battery made in China.
General Motors said Friday that three electric vehicles it plans to sell this year -- the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles -- would qualify for the full credit.
James M. Wickett, a partner at Hogan Lovells who focuses on tax and energy policy, said the electric vehicle tax credit was "moving supply chains, to the tune of tens of billions."
"The details matter in a significant way," he added.
One significant detail on Friday expanded the program to include battery minerals from Japan and paved the way for adding more countries, such as the 27 members of the European Union.
Officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have also begun discussing plans to build a kind of buyers' club for critical minerals that could exert pressure over the global industry, including setting higher labor and environmental standards for mining, processing and manufacturing.
The race is on for manufacturers whose vehicles don't qualify for the U.S. tax credits to procure the minerals and components that will satisfy the requirements. The credit awards a significant competitive advantage to any car that makes the grade.
To be eligible, at least 50 percent of the components in an electric car battery must be made in North America. And 40 percent of the minerals used to make the batteries, which often contain nickel, manganese and cobalt, must come from domestic sources or from countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The minerals quota will rise every year until it reaches 80 percent by 2027, and the component quota will climb to 100 percent in 2029.
The administration said it would later issue rules clarifying how much investment that companies could receive from countries like China and Russia and still qualify for tax credits. The law includes prohibitions on using critical minerals and battery components from a "foreign entity of concern," a term that includes companies based in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Siyu Huang, the chief executive of Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts company that is developing advanced batteries with backing from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, welcomed the trade agreement with Japan. But she said it would be "very challenging" to acquire battery-grade lithium because almost all the refineries are in China.
"The critical part of this is really about where the lithium is coming from," Ms. Huang said.
In writing the rules, Biden officials have tried to balance two priorities: Encouraging Americans to buy cleaner cars to mitigate climate change, and trying to bring more factories for cars, batteries and battery materials to the United States and its allies.
Company executives, and some analysts, said the administration had come down on the side of the latter goal. Given the limited number of vehicles that currently qualify for tax credits, some consumers could decide to wait to buy an electric car until more become eligible in a few years, said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
"What always happens if people are uncertain is they hold on to their wallets," Mr. Reinsch said.
Jennifer Safavian, the chief executive of Autos Drive America, which represents foreign carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen, welcomed Japan's inclusion and said it would help strengthen supply chains. Yet, she added, the drop in the number of eligible cars would slow the growth of electric cars.
But some lawmakers complain the Biden administration has been too generous to foreign companies. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a pivotal player in the Inflation Reduction Act's writing and passage, said this week that he may bring a court case challenging the administration's interpretation of the law.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Manchin said that the Treasury Department's guidance "completely ignores the intent" of the act.
"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains," he said. "American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas."
The legislation has already shaken up the car industry. Immediately after President Biden signed the bill in August, a provision excluded from the tax credits any electric vehicles not made in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
Hyundai and Kia cars made in South Korea no longer qualified, angering that nation's leaders, who felt betrayed by a close military and trade partner. Sales of South Korean-made electric vehicles have since lost market share in the United States.
The law also proved to be a major source of friction diplomatically. Leaders of the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies feared the program would lure investment away from their countries or force them to offer more generous subsidies to compete with the United States.
Because the European Union, Japan and Britain do not have free-trade agreements with the United States, products from those countries, including battery materials, did not qualify for any portion of the tax credits.
Under pressure from foreign governments, the Biden administration proposed a workaround. In a news release, the Treasury Department said the law did not define the term "free trade agreement," which "could include newly negotiated critical minerals agreements." The Biden administration signed a limited trade deal with Japan on Tuesday covering critical minerals, and is negotiating a similar deal with the European Union.
But the strategy has been strongly criticized by lawmakers in Congress, who have said the administration failed to consult with them on trade policy, or argue that U.S. taxpayer money will now subsidize Japanese industry.
For consumers, the new rules are likely to make many electric vehicles more expensive.
At least some Tesla vehicles are likely to remain eligible. The company makes cars in California and Texas and batteries in Nevada. Ford Motor said it would "soon" disclose whether any of its vehicles qualify.
Carmakers will have to certify whether their vehicles meet the components and minerals requirements. The Internal Revenue Service will enforce the rules. Some vehicles may qualify for only half the credit if, for example, they meet the component quotas but not the minerals quotas.
The list of eligible cars is expected to grow as it becomes easier for companies to buy processed lithium and other materials from U.S. trade partners like Canada and Australia. Numerous companies are developing mines and building refineries. More cars will also qualify once Hyundai, Ford, Honda and other automakers finish building new car and battery plants in the United States.
And a loophole in the law allows companies to collect the credits if they lease vehicles to customers, even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers could pass on those credits to consumers by reducing monthly lease payments.

How Big Tech Camouflaged Wall Street’s Crisis

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The fate of the S&P 500 index — used by investors as a barometer for the health of corporate America, and cited by presidents as a measure of their handling of the economy — often comes down to just two companies: Apple and Microsoft.
This means it’s hard to invest in the U.S. stock market, such as through a 401(k) or pension plan, and not be highly dependent on the fate of the two tech giants. More than $15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft’s and Apple’s market valuation.
It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath.
Trading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of a global investment bank in Europe sent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy, the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5%.
Apple and Microsoft accounted for more than half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4% during the month and Microsoft 15.6%.
It can be jarring for investors to see the index perform so differently from what they may have predicted, said Fiona Cincotta, a stock market analyst at StoneX, a brokerage.
“It’s phenomenal that two companies can direct so much power within the S&P 500,” she said. “These two companies seem to have been single-handedly directing the index.”
It was true even at the height of the frenzy. On Monday, March 13, immediately after the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, signs of panic were everywhere: Several regional banks suffered their worst day ever in the stock market, with First Republic Bank down more than 60%, in conditions so chaotic that trading in many individual stocks was halted as stock exchanges tried to limit the damage.
Outside the stock market, government bond yields went haywire, oil prices slid and the dollar weakened, all showing that alarms about the economy were ringing on trading desks around the world.
Yet the S&P 500 spent much of the day in positive territory, and it ended with a barely noticeable decline of 0.1%. Credit, again, goes to Microsoft and Apple, which both rose enough to counter a 15% slide in the entire regional banking sector that day.
Much of this comes down to how the S&P 500 is designed. Its value is calculated by a measure that considers the overall market capitalization of a company. It means the stock moves of the largest companies carry the greatest weight, because even slight changes in their value create or destroy billions of dollars of shareholder value.
Apple, at roughly $2.4 trillion, and Microsoft, at $2.1 trillion, are so large that, taken together, the two companies would be the third-largest sector of the index, behind tech and health care. They would be larger than the energy sector and roughly the size of the financials sector.
This influence is a result of a decadeslong shift in both the markets and the economy since the dot-com boom, a change that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates put in place to support the economy after the Great Recession made borrowing cheap and pushed investors to seek out higher returns from riskier companies, spurring financing and growth for tech companies. Apple and Microsoft excelled.
Apple in 2018 became the first American company valued at more than $1 trillion on the stock market. As its value inflated, so did that of its rivals Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) — a group that came to be called the FANG stocks. They helped to lift the index to new highs over a more than decadelong bull market. Since then, Apple and Microsoft have become proportionally much larger, more than twice the size of the next largest company.
This dynamic is not wholly unusual in the history of the S&P 500, though it is extreme, and it has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of some tech companies through the pandemic. (At the end of 2018, Microsoft’s and Apple’s combined index weight was less than Apple’s is today on its own.) The previous company to reach Microsoft’s 6.2% weight in the index was IBM in the mid-80s, based on data for the end of each calendar year.
“I don’t think it’s a problem,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “This is what the whole thing is worth, and if Apple or Microsoft go up or down, there is proportional impact because they are worth more. It’s market-driven.”
The S&P also produces an “equal weight” index, where each stock has the same effect on the wider group. In March, that index is down 3%.
Another commonly cited measure of Wall Street’s performance, the Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index that has been criticized for how it emphasizes companies based on their share price alone.
And then there are the underlying sectors, which are also tracked in separate indexes by S&P. These indexes, which tend to more directly show pain afflicting their subsets of stocks, show that the financial sector fell almost 10% in March, while energy stocks dropped 0.5% and real estate companies slid 2.1%. They also show that other parts of the market — like utilities — fared just fine.
“There were so many sectors that underperformed and were in the red across the month, and that was completely pushed over and overshadowed by the gains in big tech,” Cincotta said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the S&P 500 as well as the Dow, has tried to address the impact of these specific weightings, at least on different sectors. In 2018, it moved Alphabet and Meta out of the tech sector and into the communications category with Netflix, while leaving Amazon in the consumer discretionary category with other retailers.
Since then, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have slowly lost value, while Apple and Microsoft have grown. The technology sector in the S&P 500 has also been bolstered by the emergence of new behemoths like the chip maker Nvidia, which is valued around three quarters of a trillion dollars.
This month, S&P sought to rebalance the index again, moving a handful of large tech-oriented companies — like Visa and PayPal — into the financials sector, but further entrenching Apple and Microsoft’s dominance as the two tech heavyweights.
Of course, this cuts both ways. In 2022, the S&P 500 slumped close to 20%, a drop that would have been much smaller without the lousy performance of the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft together accounted for roughly one-fifth of the index’s total decline last year.
For now, analysts see reasons for tech to continue to rally.
One reason is the excitement over artificial intelligence. Microsoft has a large stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and many investors foresee the nascent technology driving the next phase of growth for the companies developing the software as well as the chip makers whose processors power it.
Tech stocks are also benefiting from the concern over the country’s banks, which has led investors to quickly cut back their expectation for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates, and absent an imminent recession, lower rates in the future would be a boost for the sector.
And, analysts said, large technology companies have become havens where investors can wait out the current storm.
“It’s been a big bull cycle for tech,” said George Catrambone, the head of Americas trading at DWS, a fund manager. “I don’t think people will give up that paradigm easily.”

In Designer's Farewell, Moschino Loses Laughs: [Style Desk]

Full text: In a fashion world surprise, the designer is leaving the Italian label he has helmed for 10 years.
Fashion is about to get a little less funny. In yet another major industry surprise, Jeremy Scott is leaving his post as the creative director of Moschino, the brand's parent company said in a statement on Monday. His departure ends a 10-year tenure that rejuvenated the brand by using it as a vehicle to poke fun at consumerism while simultaneously celebrating it in visual stunts tailor-made for the Instagram era. No successor has been named.
After the designer Alessandro Michele left Gucci in November, the move will further reshape the Italian fashion world, where Mr. Scott's ability to inject a kind of ironic postmodern pop humor into clothes catapulted Moschino to new relevance.
The brand became a favorite of celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, who once wore a Moschino T-shirt dress splashed with the words "I had nothing to wear so I put on this Moschino dress," and Katy Perry, who wore a Moschino chandelier and a Moschino hamburger to the Met Gala in 2019.
Massimo Ferretti, the chairman of Aeffe, the group that owns Moschino, in a statement thanked Mr. Scott for "ushering in a distinct and joyful vision that will forever be a part of Moschino history."
Mr. Scott, 47, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and studied at the Pratt Institute in New York, was only the third designer to lead the house, which was founded by Franco Moschino in 1983 to celebrate the virtues of elegant irreverence. After Mr. Moschino's death in 1994 from complications of AIDS, Rosella Jardini took over, gamely carrying on the legacy until Mr. Scott arrived in 2013 with his own sense of subversive humor.
Almost immediately, his way with a fashion pun resonated with a generation reared on social media (so much so that in 2015, Mr. Scott was tapped to redesign the "Moonman" statuette given to winners at MTV's Video Music Awards). Mr. Scott sent riffs on McDonald's and Barbie down the runway, made Le Smokings that were literally smoking in a nod to the Bonfire of the Vanities, and last September created an entire ode to inflatables because -- well, you know, inflation (and who can't use a life raft now and again?).
When Covid-19 put live fashion shows on hold, Mr. Scott presented a collection worn by marionettes crafted in Jim Henson's studio. He populated the show's pseudo front row with puppet versions of fashion editors like Anna Wintour and Edward Enninful, inviting watchers to ponder the question of who in fashion really pulls the strings.
A dress Mr. Scott designed for a Moschino collection inspired by game-show kitsch, which featured an entire TV dinner on its train, played a starring role in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 2019 exhibition "Camp: Notes on Fashion." (That dress was one of about 15 Moschino outfits in the show.) Alongside the runway stunts, Mr. Scott was canny enough to offer special collections with T-shirts and phone cases, allowing everyone access to his Moschino world.
Sometimes the jokes could fall flat, but overall the result was a boom in sales, at least until last year. In 2022, Aeffe -- which also owns the brands Alberta Ferretti, Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini and Pollini -- reported a loss of nine million euros (about $ 10 million) on revenues of 352 million euros (about $ 377 million), thanks in part to complications in China.
"He took chances, but always with a sense of fun," said Robert Burke, the founder of a namesake luxury consultancy, of Mr. Scott. "He was a great match for Moschino."
Though Mr. Scott had maintained his own eponymous brand throughout most of his time at Moschino, in recent seasons it has been put on hold. Whether it will now be revived, or whether, as he once suggested, he will move into movies, Mr. Scott did not reveal. In a text message from Seoul, where he is introducing a new collaboration with Hyundai, he simply said, "Every book has chapters and as I end this chapter, I am excited to share with the world my next chapter."
It is unclear whether Mr. Scott's tenure at Moschino ended because of a shift in the general mood in the industry, which is turning away from buzz-making theatrics and toward "timelessness" as sales of classic luxury brands including Chanel and Hermès soar, or whether, as some conventional wisdom has it, a decade is simply long enough for a single creative director to helm a fashion house. Both Mr. Scott and the Aeffe group declined to elaborate on the statement announcing his departure.
The fashion game of designer musical chairs continues.

Michigan to Be First State in Decades to End Measure That Hurt Unions: [Correction]

Full text: A state is rolling back a so-called right-to-work law for the first time in decades, as depleted unions must now relearn how to bolster their ranks.
For more than a decade, Western Michigan's food and commercial workers union has been in a defensive crouch after Republicans made union membership optional in a state once synonymous with organized labor. The union shifted from expansion and organizing to just trying to hold down attrition as workers opted out of paying their dues.
On Tuesday, the newly elected Democratic-led State Legislature gave final approval to a bill repealing a so-called right-to-work law. It was the latest in a raft of legislation out of Washington and Democratic state capitals meant to reverse the decline of organized labor and bolster Democratic political strength in elections to come.
But John Cakmakci, president of the United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 951 in Grand Rapids, warned that a rebound would take time as the state's labor apparatus relearns how to organize workers and expand. That means the payoff to Democrats could be muted for now.
"Do I think we can rebound? Absolutely," said Mr. Cakmakci (pronounced Cack-mack-ee). "Are we ready now? No."
Since 1947, when a conservative Congress passed legislation allowing states to adopt right-to-work legislation, 27 states and the territory of Guam have passed laws or constitutional amendments that give workers the right to opt out of their union dues, even if wages, benefits and work rules at their place of employment are set by a union contract.
The ensuing "free rider" problem -- workers' getting the benefit of representation without paying dues -- helped lead to a sharp decline in organized labor, as unions in right-to-work states tried, often in vain, to keep existing members signed up instead of organizing new workplaces. Nationally, union membership last year dropped to 10.1 percent of all workers, half of what the rate was in 1983.
When Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, signs the new legislation in the coming days, Michigan will become the first state in nearly 60 years to roll back the right-to-work rules, fulfilling a campaign promise Democrats made to unions before they swept control of both chambers of the Legislature as well as the governor's mansion in November.
"No one should be surprised that we are in this moment," Ms. Whitmer said in an interview. "We've done what we've said we were going to do, and we're going to continue to live up to the promise we made to people and live our values."
But to unions, the damage has been done, after Republicans shocked a state where labor was king and passed right-to-work rules in 2012. Indiana passed the same law that year, and Wisconsin followed suit in 2015 over boisterous protests.
Union membership in Michigan dropped by almost 93,000, from 16 percent to 13 percent in 2021. Certain sectors were more pronounced. Union membership among government employees dropped to 45 percent from 55 percent, and because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that government workers cannot be compelled to join a union, Michigan Democrats can do nothing to reverse that slide. Unionization at private employers in Michigan has reached 9.1 percent. The free-rider rate -- the number of workers covered by union contracts but not paying union dues -- has tripled, to 14 percent from 3.6 percent, weakening union bargaining power and draining union treasuries.
An analysis published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan clearinghouse of academic study, looked at work force trends in the five states that have passed right-to-work laws since 2011 -- Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Kentucky. The findings: States with these laws have unionization rates that are 20 percent lower than states without such laws, while wages in right-to-work states are 7.5 percent lower than states where union dues are compulsory for unionized workplaces.
Michigan Republicans who pushed through the labor law a decade ago said crippling the unions was never a goal. They wanted to see the kind of economic dynamism that right-to-work states in the South have shown, as Mercedes, Boeing, Hyundai, B.M.W. and other manufacturers opened plants there. Jase Bolger, a Republican who was Michigan House speaker at the time, said the economic renaissance in Michigan over the past decade was now at risk.
"This was never about hurting unions -- it was about empowering workers," Mr. Bolger said. "Workers are about to have their freedom to choose stripped away from them, and Democrats are underestimating how workers will respond to that."
The real question might be how the unions respond. Michigan Democrats actually passed two separate repeals -- one for the private sector and one for the public sector -- knowing the government repeal will not withstand a challenge under a 2018 Supreme Court decision.
"There are going to be people who decide not to pay their fair share," said David Hecker, president of the American Federation of Teachers local in Michigan. "We know that."
Ron Bieber, the president of the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O., said conditions were ripe for a union comeback. Unemployment is low, the job market is tight and wages are falling behind inflation.
"There's room to grow," he said. "There's always room to grow."
But the once-mighty United Auto Workers union has been in turmoil. It has been locked in a contested leadership election between the longtime chief, Ray Curry, and an insurgent rank-and-file electrician, Shawn Fain, whose core complaint is that the union has grown lazy in fighting to expand and to demand better wages and benefits.
Marick Masters, a business professor and expert on labor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said the U.A.W. represented less than 20 percent of the automotive work force, which makes up only about half of its total membership. Because electric vehicles take fewer workers on final assembly, the union must organize battery plants and other parts suppliers just to tread water, he said.
"The U.A.W. has to organize," Mr. Masters said. "I don't know if it's ready, but its track record would suggest it's not."
Mr. Bieber said the unions that were "fairly devastated" over the past decade were in the service industry, where employees are transient, wages are low and union dues are a difficult pitch.
Mr. Cakmakci with the United Food & Commercial Workers Union in Grand Rapids said his local's membership had declined to 28,500, from 32,000 before right-to-work. Fifteen percent of workers at unionized shops are not paying their dues. Instead of organizing, union leaders spend their time keeping existing workers signed up, filing paperwork to show dues aren't being coerced and answering to Republican demands on compliance.
"Their long game was to bankrupt us," he said. "Their short game was to keep us so busy we can't organize."
There have been advantages. The unions have had to prove their value to members, through new benefits like training and education, scholarships and assistance programs.
When dues were compulsory, "we got lazy, as far as I'm concerned, and the fact that Republicans took advantage of that, that's partly on us," Mr. Cakmakci said. In the right-to-work era, "the job itself became much harder, but it made our union a lot stronger, mentally, physically and intellectually."
"I do think we will be putting together an organizing team again," he added, "but I don't want to go back to ignoring our members."
With so many doubts lingering, it is not clear how the labor law's repeal will help Democrats. Michigan's Democratic lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, said he was not looking for a return.
"We've had historic investments in manufacturing, and advanced manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing in different parts of Michigan," Mr. Gilchrist said in an interview. "We're going to continue to build on that foundation, and that's what the state of Michigan is going to get. It's really not about what Democrats in the Legislature are going to get."
Union leaders are more transactional, acknowledging they are getting a return on the investments they made in Democrats last year.
"Not just union members but working people in general are going to see the difference between what it means to have a worker-friendly administration and legislature and the worker-suppression attacks that we had before," Mr. Bieber said.

Hyundai and Kia Urged
To Fix Theft Vulnerability
A group of 22 U.S. state attorneys general on Monday urged Hyundai Motor and Kia to do more to address millions of U.S. vehicles that are prone to theft.
Last month, the South Korean automakers said they would offer software upgrades to 8.3 million U.S. vehicles to help curb increasing car thefts using a method popularized on TikTok and other social media channels.
The states and the District of Columbia, led by Wisconsin's attorney general, Joshua Kaul, said the automakers had failed to take adequate steps to address the alarming rate of theft and urged them to accelerate the implementation of the software upgrade and provide free alternative protective measures for owners whose cars cannot support the software upgrade.
Hyundai and Kia did not immediately provide a response to a request for comment.
"The surge in thefts of these vulnerable vehicles has been truly shocking," said the letter. REUTERS
POLICY
Rideshare Firms Question Dept. of Labor Nominee
Rideshare and delivery companies want the Biden administration's nominee for the Department of Labor, Julie Su, right, to clarify her position on an incoming worker-classification rule that could expand workers' rights, a trade group representing the companies said on Monday.
The Department of Labor in October proposed a rule that would make it more difficult for companies to treat workers as independent contractors, which would shake up ride-hailing, delivery and other industries that rely on gig workers.
The Flex Association, which represents companies such as Uber and Lyft, sent a letter to Biden on Monday asking that Ms. Su explain how she would implement the proposed rule in a "manner that protects independent work."
The group this month said Ms. Su's record on flexible work was "troubling" and called for a "meticulous review" of her record in the Senate confirmation process.
The final worker classification rule is expected this year.

COMPANIES
New C.E.O. of Starbucks
Officially Takes the Reins
Starbucks said Monday that Laxman Narasimhan has assumed the role of C.E.O. and joined the company's board of directors. Mr. Narasimhan succeeds longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz, who came out of retirement last spring to serve as interim chief.
Mr. Schultz will remain on the company's board.
Mr. Narasimhan, 55, most recently served as C.E.O. of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health, hygiene and nutrition company. Before that he was a longtime executive at Pepsico.
Since he was named incoming C.E.O. last September, Mr. Narasimhan has traveled to more than 30 stores, manufacturing plants and support centers around the world, the company said.
The company posted record sales in its most recent quarter, which ended Jan. 1. But Mr. Schultz also faced a growing unionization effort at its U.S. stores, which the company opposes.

Full text: Artificial intelligence is steadily becoming a trusty tool for composing wedding speeches. Should it be?
Josh Withers likes it when the couples he marries mess up their vows, such as when someone says, "I take you as my awfully wedded," instead of the standard "lawfully wedded."
But lately, Mr. Withers -- an international marriage celebrant who helped found the Celebrant Institute, a training and mentoring organization in his native Australia -- has been worrying that artificial intelligence will ruin those moments. He has already heard murmurs about the chatbot ChatGPT's potential role in weddings.
"I'm seeing people using it to write speeches and write vows on wedding Facebook groups," he said. "If a computer makes the words you speak at a wedding, what you're going to get is recycled clichés. You'll lose the humanity, the moments that make us feel love."
Since its release last November, ChatGPT has become a source of concern in classrooms because of how students can use the chatbot to complete their assignments. Now, the increasing use of A.I. in weddings has raised even more questions about its potential and its ethical boundaries.
Ben Hart, who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, runs ToastWiz, an A.I. wedding speech-writing business that provides best men, maids of honor and couples' parents with scripted remarks. He started the service in December, after a bout of nerves gripped him a few years ago at his own mother's wedding, when he had headed to the microphone to propose a toast, and blanked.
After that deer-in-the-headlights moment, Mr. Hart heard what might have been a worse speech at another wedding: "It was a father of the bride speech, where the father was bragging about how much he paid for the wedding. It was awkward and uncomfortable."
For $ 30, and in less than 15 minutes, ToastWiz generates three original speeches with the help of GPT-3, another A.I. chatbot. Chris Noessel, an author and public speaker who helps audiences understand A.I., and whose day job is actually designing A.I. for IBM, said that even though bots such as ChatGPT are free, the $ 30 price tag will be worth it for some.
"Just because you have access to this tool doesn't mean you're going to know how to use it well," he said. Those who are terrified of wrestling with words for a speech and are not tech-savvy, he said, may find a service like ToastWiz -- which is tailored to write specifically for weddings, unlike ChatGPT -- more helpful.
Mr. Noessel, who lives in Richmond, Calif., is among the few ever to be married by an A.I. officiant. On April 2, 2018, he and his husband, Benjamin Remington, a user experience designer, exchanged vows read aloud by a chatbot.
Having a disembodied voice officiate was their way of honoring their relationship in a way that their 150 guests would recognize. "We kind of have a brand," Mr. Noessel said.
The vows were handwritten, but had ChatGPT been around then, and Mr. Noessel felt as if he needed help crafting language to express his love and commitment, he wouldn't have dismissed it. As an idea generator for ceremonies, toasts and vows, "there are ethical ways and unethical ways of using it," he said.
"If you went to ChatGPT and said, 'My bride-to-be's name is Marcia and we met on the beach, write me vows,' what you'll get is inauthentic because ChatGPT doesn't know Marcia. It's just regurgitating stuff out to you," Mr. Noessel said. But if the chatbot generates vows where "you end up going, 'I like the structure, but I'm going to replace these sentences with heartfelt sentiments,' I think it's fine. It's the human gate that makes it ethical in my consideration."
Myka Meier, an etiquette consultant and wedding conduct guru, believes that gate or no gate, vows assisted by A.I. may be a technological bridge too far.
"Those are words that are supposed to set the precedent for the rest of your lives together," she said. "If you feel you won't do that justice without using A.I., consider letting the officiant say them rather than writing your own."
On the other hand, Ms. Meier said she doesn't believe in using up honeymoon time writing thank-you notes when a bot can help. After her wedding in 2013, she spent hours hand writing personal thank-you cards en route to the Maldives for her honeymoon. Ms. Meier said she would never endorse using fill-in-the-blank, impersonal thank-you letters, but ChatGPT, she recently discovered, doesn't produce that kind.
Another question for those with A.I. experience and the inclination to use it might be: Why stop at vows or speeches?
Krystal Webber said she would design A.I. for her own wedding if she had the time. Ms. Webber, who lives in Austin, Texas, will be married on May 20. Her work as a partner at IBM's Global Strategic Partners Division is focused on A.I., which enables her to understand its wedding-related capabilities. Yet, she claimed that there isn't an AI interface designed with wedding considerations in mind.
"You could use technology to do comparison shopping," she said. "It could be something like, 'I'm getting married in Austin on this day, and I'm serving upscale tacos to 125 guests. What are my three best options?"' Shopping for wedding gowns could be a matter of typing, "'I'm 5-foot-2, I generally wear this size and I'm looking for something in one of these three cuts.' The technology exists. We just need somebody to build it."
Ms. Webber can rattle off a full kit of fantasy A.I. bridal tools, including one that greets out-of-town guests with a custom welcome message when they land at the airport, and another that figures out whether it's cheaper to stay at a hotel within walking distance of the venue or stay farther away and pay for cabs.
For now, though, she's stuck poring over wedding spreadsheets and envisioning a day when technology will allow for more time to focus on bridal tasks that don't involve sitting in front of a computer.
"If I could spend 10 percent of the time I'm spending on comparisons and calculations thinking about lighting and decorations, it would matter to me tremendously," she said.

Volkswagen Points $193 Billion at E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker announced a plan to accelerate its transition to battery-powered vehicles and bolster operations in China and North America.
Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would spend $ 193 billion on software, battery factories and other investments as it aimed to make every fifth vehicle it sold electric by 2025.
The automaker, the world's second biggest after Toyota, will also focus on expanding its presence in North America, where it has struggled for years, and becoming more competitive in China, one of its most important markets, said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive.
Mr. Blume laid out a 10-point plan for helping Volkswagen pivot to electric vehicles, a path it began in earnest when it effectively abandoned diesel technology after an emissions cheating scandal in 2015. The plan's centerpiece are investments totaling 180 billion euros, or about $ 193 billion. Two-thirds of that sum will be channeled into producing battery cells, developing software and shoring up supply chains of critical raw materials.
"For me, it is important that we have a clear orientation of where we are going," Mr. Blume told reporters, adding that 2023 would be "a decisive year" for the company. It is his first as chief executive; he took over in September from Herbert Diess, who aggressively pushed Volkswagen to embrace electric cars but was forced out after just four years because of disagreements with the company's board.
Mr. Blume hopes to use some of the proceeds of a 2022 initial public offering of Porsche, where he is also chief executive, to strengthen Volkswagen's electrification strategy. The listing brought in €43 billion.
Volkswagen reported a net profit in 2022 of €15.8 billion, or $ 16.7 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year, as supply chains disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic began to normalize.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused energy prices to rise and contributed to high inflation, especially in Germany. Addressing those challenges, while balancing the demand for combustion-engine vehicles as the company pivots to electric-vehicle production, will be the main focus in Europe, Volkswagen said.
"We must transform ourselves into a technology and mobility services group," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial and operating officer, said at the Tuesday media event. "We need to focus on our platforms, such as our hardware for battery-powered electric vehicles, a unified software stack, batteries, mobility, autonomous driving."
In the short term, Volkswagen will continue to produce combustion-engine cars, which generate profits that the company needs to pay for the transition to battery-powered vehicles. In 2022, Volkswagen sold 8.2 million cars and trucks.
Despite the German government's call for companies to diversify their operations in Asia, pivoting away from China, Volkswagen is continuing to invest in the country in partnerships with local companies.
Volkswagen is the leading producer of combustion-engine vehicles in China, but has lost ground to domestic carmakers in the fast-growing market for electric cars. Last year, Volkswagen introduced an "in China for China" strategy that it plans to expand, including developing technology and software specifically for consumers there, including in-car karaoke.
The automaker's problems in North America are somewhat different. After years of trying to become a bigger player in the United States specifically, it remains far behind U.S. automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor and Asian companies like Toyota and Hyundai.
Volkswagen retooled its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., last year to begin producing electric vehicles, and it now produces the ID.4 sport utility vehicle there. On Monday, Volkswagen said it had chosen a site in Ontario for a new battery plant. And earlier in March, the company said it would put up a factory in South Carolina to build pickup trucks and S.U.V.s that would be sold under the moribund Scout brand.
In Europe, a key element of the company's focus includes its first battery cell plant, a €2 billion factory that is rising out of a field in Salzgitter, Germany, near the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg. The new plant sits behind a site where Volkswagen has been building engines for more than 50 years and is slated to become the main provider of battery cells for the automaker.

Full text: Violent crime is largely receding from pandemic highs, but cities face a surge in car thefts, driven in part by videos that show how to hot-wire models by Kia and Hyundai.
One of the busiest places in Memphis these days is the impound lot north of downtown, where tow-truck drivers can sit in line for over six hours to make drop-offs, victims can wait weeks to get stolen vehicles back and some 2,700 cars are squeezed onto the grounds of an old farm-equipment factory.
The overcrowding is the result in part of an auto theft boom that has gripped Memphis and other U.S. cities. Vehicles from two manufacturers, Kia and Hyundai, have proven especially vulnerable to theft, prompting cities to file lawsuits against the carmakers and at least one state's attorney general to open an investigation.
Of the nearly 11,000 cars stolen in Memphis last year -- about twice as many as in 2021 -- roughly a third were late-model Kias and Hyundais, according to the police. It doesn't take much to rip them off: just a screwdriver, a USB cord and hot-wiring know-how found in videos proliferating on social media.
Many of the culprits are teenagers or young adults stealing cars for kicks or to use them for other crimes, such as robberies, the police say. More than half of the 175 people arrested and accused of car theft this year in Memphis were teenagers, who often abandon the vehicles after a joyride.
"We know that a lot of our young people are breaking into cars and stealing cars as almost a dare, or a trend, right now," Cerelyn J. Davis, the Memphis police chief, told the City Council at a recent meeting. "They are finding it easy to do."
American cities have faced a rise in car thefts during the coronavirus pandemic. Some other categories of crime, including homicides and aggravated assaults, rose nationally in 2020 and 2021 and then declined somewhat last year, though they remain above prepandemic levels, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice.
But auto thefts have continued to rise, even as other forms of lawbreaking have leveled out or fallen.
Early in the pandemic, experts who study crime say, more vehicles were stolen partly because people were staying home: Cars were left on streets during the day, rather than in secure parking lots near offices. But the surge has continued, fueled in part by social media videos that show, step by step, how to steal Kias and Hyundais that are not equipped with an engine immobilizer -- an electronic security device that keeps a car from being started without a key.
"All you had to do was put something on TikTok, how to steal these cars, and they started getting stolen left and right," said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, at a news conference last week in Buffalo, where he brandished a USB cord while standing next to recent auto theft victims.
The two Korean car brands, part of the same conglomerate, are increasingly popular in America, accounting for about a 10th of U.S. auto sales last year. They recently issued statements saying they had fixed the problem that makes their vehicles relatively easy to steal in their latest models, and were introducing free software upgrades for vulnerable cars -- about 4.5 million Kias and 3.8 million Hyundais, the federal government estimated.
At the same time, the companies have shipped steering wheel locks to police departments across the country, to be provided free of charge to car owners who drive at-risk models. And executives say they are constantly monitoring TikTok and YouTube for new videos that show how to steal their vehicles, and then alerting the social media companies so those videos can be removed. Kia said in a statement that it was "committed to supporting law enforcement and owners in addressing these crimes."
Representatives for YouTube and TikTok said the companies had removed several videos related to what is known as the "Kia Challenge" in recent months. YouTube said in a statement that it might allow some of the videos to remain if "they're meant to be educational, documentary, scientific or artistic." A TikTok spokesman said the social network "does not condone this behavior, which violates our policies and will be removed if found on our platform."
Julie Garcia of San Antonio said she knew her Kia Sportage was vulnerable to theft, but she hoped it would not be attractive to thieves because the rear bumper was damaged. She also parked in view of security cameras whenever she could.
"It's a scary feeling," she said, "not knowing if your car's going to be there or not."
But on an afternoon in late December, Ms. Garcia found shards of glass on the ground where she had parked. It took the police two days to track down her Sportage. When she retrieved it, she found her steering column ripped apart, a window smashed and trash, including deli meat, strewn inside.
James Lint, a lieutenant with the San Antonio Police Department, said such destruction was common among stolen vehicles. "It's not often we get them back in good condition," he said. "They are torn up, ripped up, marked on, painted on."
Ms. Garcia, 31, is now warning anyone she knows who owns a Kia.
"I'm just trying to spread awareness," she said. "Because I don't want what happened to me to happen to somebody else."
Officials say the social media-driven rise in Kia and Hyundai thefts began about two years ago in Milwaukee, and then spread nationwide. City attorneys for Seattle and Columbus recently sued the automakers for not installing anti-theft technology, and other cities, including Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis, have threatened litigation.
This week, Minnesota's attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he was investigating whether the companies had violated his state's consumer protection and public nuisance laws. "The drastic increase in Kia and Hyundai vehicle thefts is continuing to threaten public safety and do serious harm to our communities," he said in a statement.
The car-theft surge has been the most persistent and wide-ranging crime trend in America during the pandemic, affecting jurisdictions large and small.
In the 30 major cities examined by the Council on Criminal Justice, motor vehicle thefts were up 21 percent last year from 2021 -- resulting in an estimated 37,560 more stolen cars in those places. This followed double-digit increases in 2020 and 2021. (Carjackings, categorized as a violent crime and counted separately, have also risen in some cities.)
Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri and the lead author of the council's report, said the social media phenomenon was only part of the problem. "There is no definitive explanation for this large and sustained increase in motor vehicle theft," he said. "It seems, in my view, to have taken on the characteristic of something like a contagion."
Sometimes, officials say, the stolen cars are linked to other crimes, deadly crashes and even vigilantism, as car-theft victims take matters into their own hands after locating their vehicles with trackers.
In St. Louis last year, the drivers of two stolen cars -- one a Hyundai, the other a Kia -- were involved in a shootout at a busy intersection near downtown, leaving a 17-year-old with a gunshot wound. And a woman in St. Louis County was charged with murder after the police said she tracked down her stolen Hyundai in late December and killed two men.
In Buffalo, four teenagers riding in a stolen Kia were killed in October when they crashed into a wall on an expressway and flew through the car's glass roof. And Mr. Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, said that stolen Kias and Hyundais in Minneapolis were linked to five homicides, 13 shootings, 36 robberies and 265 vehicle accidents last year.
Columbus, which has sued both carmakers to recoup the costs in city resources devoted to dealing with the rise in thefts, is seeing an average of 17 Kias and Hyundais stolen each day, said Zach Klein, the city attorney.
"These are used cars that a lot of retail and middle-class workers drive," he said, adding that there was "this cascading effect not only to law enforcement that are dealing with it but also to the everyday citizens in our community that are the victims of these crimes and then don't have an alternative vehicle to get to work."
Owners of Kias and Hyundais have taken to cautioning one another to be on the lookout. On the week before Christmas, Tylar Talkington was leaving her apartment in Phoenix to buy ice cream when she found her Kia Soul missing. On the ground where she had parked it was a grapefruit-size rock amid shards of glass.
Ms. Talkington, 33, filed a police report. When she told her family what had happened, she learned about the social media trend. "I guess there's a TikTok challenge going around -- the Kia boys, they call themselves -- just showing you how to commit grand theft auto, online," she said.
She left a note on a neighbor's Kia, warning her about the theft. The next night, after retrieving her car, with its steering column ripped open and its interior a mess, Ms. Talkington saw that her neighbor's car was missing.
"There was another police car in the apartment complex," she said. "And a pile of broken glass where my neighbor's car should have been."

When Health Plans Change, Not Everyone Is Happy: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Retirees whose former employers offer health coverage are being shifted to privately run Medicare Advantage, often against their wishes. The change saves millions for employers.
Bob Bentkowski, a retired New York City firefighter, has a rare, painful disease that caused his kidneys to swell almost to the size of basketballs. He needed a transplant, and in the fall of 2021, he found a donor after waiting for years -- but he was unsure whether Medicare would cover his surgery.
New York City has long provided its retired employees with comprehensive health benefits that pay for most of their Medicare costs. But with his transplant approaching, the city, and a coalition of its labor unions, had thrown Mr. Bentkowski a curveball. Aiming to save $ 600 million annually, they were negotiating to shift 250,000 retirees out of traditional fee-for-service Medicare into a privately operated Medicare Advantage plan.
"I was panicking about what might happen if I moved over to this new plan, since I was only a month away from the surgery," Mr. Bentkowski said. But after hours on the phone with the insurance company, he was told that it couldn't give him an answer until he enrolled. "They just give you the runaround -- how am I going to join the plan when I don't know what it will cover?"
Ultimately, Mr. Bentkowski's surgery was covered under traditional Medicare. The city's plans for Medicare Advantage became bogged down in litigation and political battles, with the opposition led by a group of New York City retirees who organized to fight not only the city but their own unions. Their battle has continued into this year, with a group representing city workers voting Thursday to approve the latest Advantage proposal.
The fight in New York City is a highly visible example of a nationwide shift in the way some retirees receive health insurance benefits from former employers, both in the public and private sector. It pits the drive to control health care costs against retired workers' pocketbook and health concerns.
Many employers have dropped these benefits over the past several decades, and those that still offer them are shifting retirees into Medicare Advantage plans at a rapid pace.
Half of large employers offering benefits to Medicare-age retirees have contracts with Medicare Advantage plans, nearly double the share in 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. And roughly 44 percent don't give retirees a choice to use traditional Medicare within their programs. Most cited lower cost as the key reason.
The growth is part of a bigger story about Medicare Advantage expansion. Advantage is an alternative to traditional Medicare offered by insurance companies, and it uses managed-care techniques to control costs. Nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Advantage plans last year, more than double the rate in 2007. And enrollment is projected to cross the 50 percent threshold as soon as this year, according to K.F.F.
Retirees who are shifted into Medicare Advantage plans may not fully understand the major differences from traditional Medicare. These include the requirement to use physicians and hospitals in their plan's narrower network, and reduced access to care in some instances. A federal investigation concluded last year that tens of thousands of people in Medicare Advantage plans were denied necessary care that should be covered.
The shift will also mean higher costs for taxpayers and all Medicare beneficiaries, some experts say. Payments by the federal government to Advantage plans average 102 percent of its spending on the fee-for-service traditional program, and that contributes to higher overall Medicare spending. This occurs in part because a bonus system awards extra dollars to plans that achieve high quality ratings from Medicare.
Advantage plans have also been found to submit to Medicare inflated bills that over-diagnose their patients. According to federal audits, the practice of "upcoding" crossed the line into fraud. Excess payments totaled $ 12 billion in 2020, according to the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress.
The higher costs add financial pressure to Medicare's hospital insurance (Part A) trust fund, as well as the taxpayers, beneficiaries and state-run Medicaid programs that fund the Part B program. The Part A trust fund is forecast to run dry in 2028, leaving revenue sufficient to meet 90 percent of the program's obligations.
"On the one hand, Medicare Advantage allows employers to continue to offer retiree health benefits and potentially broaden benefits, and may lower their financial liability for retiree health," said Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of K.F.F. "It also has the possibility of increasing Medicare spending."
Insurers argue that Medicare Advantage group plans are simply one choice available to retirees. "Medicare rules require that retirees always have the option to opt out of enrollment in a group Medicare Advantage plan in favor of other forms of coverage that may be available," said Heather Soule, a spokeswoman for United Healthcare, one of the largest providers of Advantage plans.
But for many retirees, joining an Advantage plan can be a difficult decision to reverse. Traditional Medicare should be paired with supplemental coverage -- often a Medigap policy -- to protect against potentially high out-of-pocket costs. But the best time to buy a Medigap policy is during the six months after you sign up for Part B (outpatient services), when insurers cannot reject you, or charge a higher premium, because of pre-existing conditions. After that time, you can be rejected or charged more in most states.
What's more, when employers make this transition, retirees often face a choice: Join an Advantage plan or lose the benefit.
"It really takes away choice," said Marilyn Moon, an economist and a former trustee of both Social Security and Medicare. "The whole idea of Medicare Advantage was supposed to be to give people more choice, not less."
Seeking cost savings
Medicare Advantage offers employers an opportunity to reduce costs substantially. They and unions traditionally have provided a retiree health benefit that fills the gaps in traditional Medicare by paying for deductibles and co-pays, and by providing other benefits. When an employer contracts with a Medicare Advantage insurer, retirees get all of their benefits, including their Medicare-covered benefits, from this Medicare Advantage plan.
In New York City, labor unions representing retirees have been working with the city on its planned shift to Advantage. They promoted the projected savings and their ability to use their bargaining clout to negotiate for far more generous features than those in plans available for individual purchase.
"When we looked at this, we saw that we could design our own plan that would get the same benefits and even more for our retirees," said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city teachers' union. "One of our greatest assets is the ability to use our buying power to get that done and, more importantly, to set up an accountability system and a contract where we're holding the provider to every single word in our contract."
As the plan was originally envisioned in 2018, retirees who wanted to stay on traditional Medicare could do so if they paid an estimated $ 191 per month to cover its higher cost to the city. But a grass-roots group founded in 2021, the NYC Organization of Public Service Retirees, sued over the plan, taking its battle to the City Council and organizing through Facebook, YouTube and email.
On Thursday, the Municipal Labor Committee, which represents the city's 102 unions, approved the latest plan to offer only Medicare Advantage starting this September.
In a statement on Thursday, Mayor Eric Adams said the new arrangement "improves upon retirees' current plans," and includes a lower deductible, a cap on out-of-pocket expenses, and new benefits. "We also heard the concerns of retirees and worked to significantly limit the number of procedures subject to prior authorization under this plan," Mr. Adams said. "This Medicare Advantage Plan is in the best interests of retirees and taxpayers."
The retiree group says it is considering its next steps, possibly including new litigation‌. "Labor should never support privatizing public health care or stripping retirees of vested earned benefits," the group's founder, Marianne Pizzitola, a retired city Fire Department Emergency Medical Services employee‌, said in a statement.
"This is a daily anxiety the city and the Municipal Labor Committee are putting us through," she added in an interview.
Mr. Bentkowski felt that anxiety in 2021 as he tried to learn whether an Advantage plan would cover his kidney transplant. He was among the first firefighters to respond at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, and a lung-related disability that developed afterward forced him to retire at age 45. He qualifies for Medicare now, at 53, because he receives Social Security Disability Insurance.
"The Medicare Advantage plan might be good for some people," Mr. Bentkowski said. "But you just can't squeeze everyone into one plan and say it's going to work."
The protection of labor agreements and the municipal code has given opponents of the New York City plan leverage to fight the Medicare Advantage transition. In the corporate sector, retiree benefits are offered at employers' discretion -- but that hasn't stopped some retirees from trying to fight these transitions.
IBM introduced two new Medicare Advantage plans this year for its large retired work force, replacing a plan that paid for supplemental Medigap coverage along with prescription drugs, dental and vision.
IBM retirees were given the option to stick with the old benefit -- but they would lose access to balances in their health reimbursement arrangements, an employer-funded plan that reimburses certain medical expenses and insurance premiums. In most cases, employers retain the right to change this type of benefit, says Trevis Parson, chief actuary for individual marketplace business at the benefits consulting firm Willis Towers Watson.
"Most plan sponsors include language in their plan documents explicitly reserving rights to amend the plan," he said. Some retirees were outraged by that tactic, and by the announcement of the planned transition with relatively short notice in September.
"They sprung it on us -- either take Medicare Advantage or forfeit your balance," said Steve Bergeron, who retired from IBM in 2009 after 29 years.
In a statement, IBM said that for 2023, two Medicare Advantage P.P.O. options have "enhanced design elements above and beyond what participants were previously able to obtain with individual policies."
Like many group plans, the new IBM offering features co-pays and annual deductibles much lower than those found in individual plans, and wider networks of providers. But it's not clear how long those features will remain.
"There's no guarantee of anything from IBM," Mr. Bergeron said. "What if these terms were just to get people to sign up?"
Dr. Neuman of K.F.F. shares that concern. "The question is, what happens over the longer term for retirees, perhaps five or 10 years from now, when the circumstances may change and it may be more difficult to maintain the favorable terms of a negotiated contract?" she asked.
Mr. Bergeron has been organizing retirees on social media to fight the change and with an online petition calling on IBM to drop the plan. He has also tried to recruit lawyers to sue the company, but most have advised that the case is not strong, since the retiree benefit is discretionary.
After holding out against the change, Mr. Bergeron reluctantly joined one of the Advantage plans, not wanting to forfeit the $ 27,000 balance in his health reimbursement arrangement.
"I never dreamed I would join, but I did," he said. "I waited until the last minute, and signed up on the last day that I could. I really was fighting it in my brain."

Columbus, which has sued both carmakers to recoup the costs in city resources devoted to dealing with the rise in thefts, is seeing an average of 17 Kias and Hyundais stolen each day, said Zach Klein, the city attorney.
“These are used cars that a lot of retail and middle-class workers drive,” he said, adding that there was “this cascading effect not only to law enforcement that are dealing with it but also to the everyday citizens in our community that are the victims of these crimes and then don’t have an alternative vehicle to get to work.”
Owners of Kias and Hyundais have taken to cautioning one another to be on the lookout. On the week before Christmas, Tylar Talkington was leaving her apartment in Phoenix to buy ice cream when she found her Kia Soul missing. On the ground where she had parked it was a grapefruit-size rock amid shards of glass.
Talkington, 33, filed a police report. When she told her family what had happened, she learned about the social media trend. “I guess there’s a TikTok challenge going around — the Kia boys, they call themselves — just showing you how to commit grand theft auto, online,” she said.
She left a note on a neighbor’s Kia, warning her about the theft. The next night, after retrieving her car, with its steering column ripped open and its interior a mess, Talkington saw that her neighbor’s car was missing.
“There was another police car in the apartment complex,” she said. “And a pile of broken glass where my neighbor’s car should have been.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His firm, Kohn Pedersen Fox, became an international force, merging the commercial with the creative in designing some of the world's tallest buildings.
Eugene Kohn, an architect who co-founded the firm Kohn Pedersen Fox in 1976 and whose ambitions led it to become, within a few years, a rival to long-established international architectural firms and one of the most prolific designers of skyscrapers in the world, died on Thursday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 92.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Barbara Shattuck Kohn, said.
At last count, KPF, as the firm is known, had designed more than 250 skyscrapers around the globe, including some of the tallest. Among them are the World Financial Center in Shanghai; headquarters for Unilever and Amazon in London; the World Bank headquarters in Washington; the Abu Dhabi International Airport; the International Commerce Center in Hong Kong; the headquarters of Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati; Baruch College in Manhattan; the IBM headquarters in Armonk, N.Y.; and the Infinity Tower in São Paulo.
The firm also designed some of New York's tallest new buildings, including One Vanderbilt, next door to Grand Central Terminal, as well as 30 Hudson Yards, 10 Hudson Yards and 55 Hudson Yards.
At Mr. Kohn's death, KPF had grown from three partners in a borrowed office in Midtown Manhattan into an enterprise with 650 employees and offices on three continents, devoted to the production of designs that balanced the strong expression of an architectural idea with an equally strong pragmatism.
KPF has been known for being at the forefront of design and for giving its buildings a whiff of the cutting edge, but never so much of one as to alienate its corporate clients. Mr. Kohn knew how to speak a chief executive's language, and if he proposed a building that was somewhat more daring than what his clients had expected, he was exceptionally good at convincing them that it would be in their interest to go along.
"It's kind of ludicrous to say commercial architecture in itself is not worth our best efforts," Mr. Kohn said in an interview for a 1987 monograph on the firm's first decade of work, "because what, in fact, influences the life of the average person in our urban areas more than commercial architecture? Cities are made up of commercial buildings. Designing quality architecture for commercial buildings is the contribution we intend to make."
The key to KPF's success was the unusual partnership between Mr. Kohn, who was passionate about design but did not see himself as a creative innovator, and William Pedersen, a talented designer who had worked under I.M. Pei on the design of the East Building of the National Gallery in Washington and who, by the mid-1970s, was eager to take on new challenges.
Mr. Kohn was then in charge of the New York office of John Carl Warnecke, a prominent architect based in San Francisco, and he recruited Mr. Pedersen to join him there. Mr. Kohn had previously persuaded Sheldon Fox, an architecture school classmate from the University of Pennsylvania, to join him at Warnecke. There, the three men set about trying to expand the firm's presence on the East Coast.
But a lot of the work Mr. Kohn had hoped to generate didn't materialize, and he decided he would be better off on his own. He persuaded Mr. Pedersen to join him as a design partner and Mr. Fox to oversee the firm's business affairs, and the three went into business as Kohn Pedersen Fox at the depth of New York's economic troubles in the 1970s.
"It was a frightening time," Mr. Pedersen recalled. "We had about enough money to survive for three months. We even worried about the long-distance phone charges for all of Gene's calls trying to get work."
Triumvirate at the Top
With the extroverted Mr. Kohn as impresario and the public face of the firm, the more reflective Mr. Pedersen at the drawing board, and Mr. Fox managing the business side, the three constituted an unusual but effective partnership between the commercial and the creative, and KPF prospered despite the challenging economy.
The firm's first commission was the conversion of an armory on West 66th Street in Manhattan into studios for ABC Television, finished in 1977. That led to a second, entirely new building next door for ABC, which was completed two years later. When Capital Cities bought ABC in 1985, Mr. Kohn quickly established a relationship with the new owners, and before long the company was commissioning more buildings from KPF. Eventually the site grew to become an entire ABC campus of production studios as well as a new corporate headquarters, all designed by KPF.
From the beginning, Mr. Kohn's aspirations went beyond Manhattan. Another early commission was in Philadelphia, the city where he was born, and where in 1983 the firm built the One Logan Square complex, with a low, sprawling wing sheathed in granite that contained the Four Seasons Hotel and a 30-story office tower of granite and glass behind it. The combination was an attempt to fit a commercial program into the classical, civic setting of Logan Square.
At the same time, KPF completed 333 Wacker Drive in Chicago, an elegant tower with a softly curving glass facade opposite a bend in the Chicago River -- a sculptural form that made it an instant Chicago landmark and the firm's first building to receive national acclaim.
The success of 333 Wacker Drive was followed by requests to design a headquarters for Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, a large tower at 900 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, an office tower on Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles, and several more buildings in New York. At that point KPF was not yet a decade old, and it was winning commissions that a few years earlier would have gone to larger and better-known firms like Skidmore Owings & Merrill and I.M. Pei.
Mr. Kohn positioned the firm not only as business-friendly but also as committed to the new, and in KPF's early years he encouraged Mr. Pedersen to explore the new style that was increasingly coming to be known as postmodernism.
KPF's buildings soon became ornate, rich compositions of stone and glass, often with abstracted and simplified classical detailing. The firm's towers almost never had flat tops; instead, they had pyramids or domes or lanterns or gables or, sometimes, a combination of them all. Mr. Kohn wanted clients to feel that in hiring KPF they were getting buildings that made a strong statement about the architecture of the moment, and they did.
KPF continued to be a barometer of architectural trends as the firm grew, but Mr. Kohn's sympathy for postmodernism's notion of new buildings as collages of historical elements dwindled; both he and Mr. Pedersen had come to find postmodernism fussy. "I must admit, a few of our buildings went too far," he wrote in a memoir, "The World by Design," written with Clifford Pearson and published in 2019.
Mr. Kohn decided, he wrote, that the future lay in "an updated modernism that was more sophisticated and complicated than the simple glass boxes of the 1960s and '70s." The notion of a building as a richly textured assemblage of different geometric shapes became the firm's new signature, expressed in such projects as the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, finished in 1992, and the World Bank in Washington, a commission KPF won by beating Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Edward Larrabee Barnes, and Arthur Erickson in an international competition.
As the firm continued to grow, Mr. Kohn turned his ambitions to the rest of the world. He wanted the firm to become global, and he set his sights first on London, where his enthusiasm for networking resulted in an invitation to Kensington Palace to meet with Prince Charles. Before long Mr. Kohn had gotten the commission to design a new European headquarters for Goldman Sachs, and the London practice was launched. (It also led to his meeting Barbara Shattuck, a Goldman banker, who became his third wife.)
Not long after, Mr. Kohn began to market KPF's work in Europe and Asia, where he positioned the firm as a place that could satisfy the growing predilection for super-tall towers across Asia. The firm would design the tallest buildings in South Korea, Hong Kong and Indonesia, as well as the tallest towers in six Chinese cities: Beijing, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Guangzhou and Kunming. KPF also designed numerous skyscrapers in Shanghai, and the tallest buildings in Paris and Montreal.
Watercolors and Steel
Arthur Eugene Kohn -- he used only his middle name throughout his life, but sometimes wrote his name as A. Eugene Kohn -- was born on Dec. 12, 1930, the only child of William and Hannah Kohn. His father owned a medical supply company, and his mother was a dressmaker who loved to paint and would instill in her son a lifelong passion for making watercolors.
He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree, spent three years in the Navy, and then returned to Penn, where he studied under Louis Kahn and received a master's degree in architecture.
He began his career in 1960 as a designer at the Philadelphia architecture firm of Vincent G. Kling. Five years later, he moved to New York to become the design director of Welton Becket Associates, a large commercial firm, where he remained until John Carl Warnecke recruited him to oversee his New York office. He started as the head designer there and soon became the firm's president.
Although KPF's success came quickly, the firm was not without its internal tensions. Mr. Kohn's enthusiasm for growth was not always shared by his partners, and Mr. Pedersen and Mr. Fox tried at first to talk him out of opening an office in London. Years later, after the London office had become a major profit center for the firm, the partner who had left New York to run it, Lee Polisano, tried to secede from the rest of KPF and make London into a separate firm with himself in charge. Determined to quash the coup, Mr. Kohn, who by then was 78, moved to London for two years and ran the London office himself.
Although the firm would also open offices in Berlin, Shanghai, Singapore, Abu Dhabi and San Francisco, New York remained the "mother ship," as James von Klemperer, now the president of KPF, put it. "The real design work is done in New York and London," he said, because Mr. Kohn, who prided himself on his mentoring of younger architects, wanted to be involved in every project.
"Gene never wanted this to be a franchise operation, no matter how large it grew," Mr. von Klemperer said. "He wanted every partner to know every other partner, and he wanted the firm to feel like a tight unit."
Mr. Kohn eased away from day-to-day management of the firm in the early 2000s, but he remained its chairman until his death. He continued to oversee several projects himself, including one of KPF's most unusual buildings, the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, which he wrapped in a series of silver ribbons mounted over what he called "Ferrari red corrugated aluminum panels." He wanted the design to "express the aerodynamics of wind whipping around a speeding car," he said.
Mr. Kohn married Barbara Schwartz in 1954. That marriage ended in divorce, as did a subsequent marriage, to Diane Barnes. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children from his first marriage, Brian Kohn, Steven Kohn and Laurie Parkinson; his stepchildren, Alexandra, Charles and Melinda Dubow; seven grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren. He spent the winters in Montecito and the rest of the time at homes in Manhattan and Washington, Conn.
Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Kohn continued to meet with potential clients in the hope of persuading them to hire KPF, and he did not accept defeat. "If we don't get the job after competing for a big project, I stay in contact with the client," he wrote. "I cultivate relationships like some people do orchids or bonsai -- carefully and with the long term in mind."

U.S. and Europe Seek New Trade Deal to Resolve Climate Dispute: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: American and European officials are trying to reach agreement on the outlines of a limited trade deal that could help resolve a major rift over America's new climate legislation.
WASHINGTON -- American and European officials meeting in Washington this week are trying to agree on the outlines of a limited trade deal that would allow European companies to qualify for some of the benefits of the Biden administration's new climate legislation, in a bid to assuage a major source of tension between the allies.
The governments hope to announce their intention to begin negotiations over an agreement focusing on the critical minerals that go into electric vehicle batteries as soon as Friday, when President Biden is set to meet with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, at the White House.
American officials have also been carrying out similar conversations with the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom to see if some type of limited new agreement could be struck that would also offer Japanese and British companies certain benefits under the law.
At the center of the debate is the Inflation Reduction Act, a $ 370 billion bill that President Biden signed last year to try to mitigate climate change by transforming U.S. power generation and the car industry. The bill offers generous tax credits to American consumers to purchase new and used electric vehicles, but it imposes tough restrictions on the types of vehicles that can benefit from these rules, in ways that disadvantage foreign carmakers.
The law specifies that, to receive a tax credit, cars must be assembled in North America and source the material for their batteries from North America, or from countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement. Despite close ties, the United States does not have a free-trade agreement with the European Union, Japan or the United Kingdom.
The passage of the law has prompted harsh criticism from allies, who say companies in their countries will be penalized. European officials have been particularly outspoken, arguing that the bill comes at a delicate time for a European economy that is already contending with disruptions from the war in Ukraine and skyrocketing energy prices.
The dispute has raised the prospect of a subsidy war between the United States and the European Union, and threatened to strain relations at a time when both sides are trying to maintain a united front against Russia.
"I don't think U.S. government officials anticipated this level of pushback and this level of disdain against this massive climate bill," said Olga Khakova, the deputy director for European energy security at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center. But she said emotions had now subsided a bit. "We are in this mode right now where we want to find a solution."
The rift has set off a scramble within the U.S. government to try to scrape together some type of new trade deal that could be signed with allied governments to allow their companies to benefit from some of the law's tax credits. With such an agreement, for example, a company based in the European Union could help to supply lithium, nickel or other battery materials for electric vehicles made in North America.
A Treasury official said that any new trade agreements would be evaluated during a rule-making process to ensure that they comply with the critical mineral requirements in the legislation. The official pointed to Chinese control over the critical mineral supply as a reason for the need for the United States to team up with like-minded countries.
A U.S. official said that the administration had been engaged in consultations with Congress about such an agreement, and that those briefings, and conversations with unions and private industry, would continue in the coming weeks.
The Treasury Department, in a white paper published in December, said that the Inflation Reduction Act did not define the term "free trade agreement," and that the Treasury secretary could identify additional free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement going forward.
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said last month that the Biden administration was considering limited trade deals focused on critical minerals as a solution, and she suggested that these could be done without the approval of Congress. She emphasized that the intent of the law was not for the United States to steal jobs from Europe and that the law was meant to be aligned with the administration's "friend-shoring" agenda.
"I think the word 'free trade' was meant to mean reliable friends and partners with whom we can feel we have secure supply chains," Ms. Yellen said on the sidelines of the Group of 20 finance ministers meetings in India last month. "We've been very clear with Europe that this is not a subsidy war."
With input from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, officials from the Treasury Department have prepared a document spelling out what kind of deal would constitute a "free-trade agreement" for the purposes of the legislation, according to people familiar with the plans.
It is not clear how quickly the solution could be completed, however, as the white paper said the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service would seek public comment on "what criteria should be used to identify free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement."
In a briefing on Friday, a European official said Europe and the United States could announce by the end of this week a commitment to forge a new limited trade deal, most likely focused on supply chains for critical minerals. Unlike a traditional free-trade agreement, which entails reducing barriers to trade between partners, this agreement would not involve lowering tariffs on either side, and the parties would aim to flesh out the agreement in days or weeks, rather than months, the European official said.
The official added that the agreement would need to be legally binding, and would still involve seeking some type of approval from European Union member states. In the United States, the agreement could come in the form of an executive order from the Biden administration, and without requiring the approval of Congress, the official suggested.
One irony is that neither the European Union nor the United States is a major source of the critical minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries. But some officials have suggested that the partnership would form a foundation for a group that could be expanded over time to include countries with larger supplies of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other minerals.
In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, Ms. Von der Leyen spoke about building "a critical raw materials club" with like-minded partners, including the United States, to strengthen supply chains and overcome China's "existing monopoly."
While analysts said a new deal with Europe could in practice satisfy the requirements of the law, it would not really resemble a free-trade agreement, as such agreements have come to be understood.
Free-trade deals are legal agreements that the World Trade Organization defines as covering "substantially all trade" between countries, including a broad range of goods and, typically, services. They usually take years to negotiate and, in the United States, require the approval of Congress.
Scott Lincicome, the director of general economics at the Cato Institute, said that the Biden administration's authority to strike such trade pacts was questionable but that it was unlikely that anyone would try to mount a legal challenge to them.
"Everyone in the room knows that this is not kosher, but there's not really anything anybody can do about it," Mr. Lincicome said.
Political appetite for striking new free-trade deals has diminished in the United States in recent years, in part because of a perception that such pacts have helped multinational corporations move factories and jobs offshore.
Efforts to strike expansive trade deals with Europe and a group of Asian countries during the Obama administration fizzled, in part because of that political opposition. During the Trump administration, the United States signed a series of limited trade deals with South Korea, Japan and China that were carried out through executive orders, not by congressional approval.
Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the limited deal would mollify the Europeans, and that U.S.-E.U. economic relations were too important "to not allow the Europeans under the tent in some way or another." But it could escalate complaints from other trading partners, like South Korea, that don't feel as though their concerns have been taken care of, he said.
South Korea already has a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the United States, but it has other criticisms of the climate law, centering on how the current terms exclude electric vehicles made by Hyundai from receiving tax credits. "Once you make accommodations for one, the pressure grows to make accommodations for others," he said.
It remains unclear how Congress will respond. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the administration is not adhering to the law's original intent of promoting U.S. manufacturing. Many also disapprove of efforts by the executive branch to bypass congressional authority in approving trade deals.
But Democrats may also be sympathetic to the effort to smooth over relations with Europeans, and reluctant to reopen debate over their signature climate legislation. And at least one key lawmaker, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, has said he didn't realize that the European Union lacked a free-trade agreement with the United States in the first place.
Still, the dispute has elicited some criticism that American officials are going to great lengths to mollify Europeans, especially given that the European Union imposes some trade barriers on the United States, like a relatively high tariff on imported U.S. cars.
John G. Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said it was his group's view that the Biden administration should fight against various E.U. policies that discriminate against American companies "with the same doggedness European officials have brought to their complaints about the I.R.A."

WASHINGTON — American and European officials meeting in Washington this week are trying to agree on the outlines of a limited trade deal that would allow European companies to qualify for some of the benefits of the Biden administration’s new climate legislation, in a bid to assuage a major source of tension between the allies.
The governments hope to announce their intention to begin negotiations over an agreement focusing on the critical minerals that go into electric vehicle batteries as soon as Friday, when President Joe Biden is set to meet with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, at the White House.
U.S. officials have also been carrying out similar conversations with the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom to see if some type of limited new agreement could be struck that would also offer Japanese and British companies certain benefits under the law.
At the center of the debate is the Inflation Reduction Act, a $370 billion bill that President Joe Biden signed last year to try to mitigate climate change by transforming U.S. power generation and the car industry. The bill offers generous tax credits to American consumers to purchase new and used electric vehicles, but it imposes tough restrictions on the types of vehicles that can benefit from these rules, in ways that disadvantage foreign carmakers.
The law specifies that, to receive a tax credit, cars must be assembled in North America and source the material for their batteries from North America, or from countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement. Despite close ties, the United States does not have a free-trade agreement with the European Union, Japan or the United Kingdom.
The passage of the law has prompted harsh criticism from allies, who say companies in their countries will be penalized. European officials have been particularly outspoken, arguing that the bill comes at a delicate time for a European economy that is already contending with disruptions from the war in Ukraine and skyrocketing energy prices.
The dispute has raised the prospect of a subsidy war between the United States and the European Union, and threatened to strain relations at a time when both sides are trying to maintain a united front against Russia.
“I don’t think U.S. government officials anticipated this level of pushback and this level of disdain against this massive climate bill,” said Olga Khakova, the deputy director for European energy security at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center. But she said emotions had now subsided a bit. “We are in this mode right now where we want to find a solution.”
The rift has set off a scramble within the U.S. government to try to scrape together some type of new trade deal that could be signed with allied governments to allow their companies to benefit from some of the law’s tax credits. With such an agreement, for example, a company based in the European Union could help to supply lithium, nickel or other battery materials for electric vehicles made in North America.
A Treasury official said that any new trade agreements would be evaluated during a rule-making process to ensure that they comply with the critical mineral requirements in the legislation. The official pointed to Chinese control over the critical mineral supply as a reason for the need for the United States to team up with like-minded countries.
A U.S. official said that the administration had been engaged in consultations with Congress about such an agreement, and that those briefings, and conversations with unions and private industry, would continue in the coming weeks.
The Treasury Department, in a white paper published in December, said that the Inflation Reduction Act did not define the term “free trade agreement,” and that the Treasury secretary could identify additional free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement going forward.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that the Biden administration was considering limited trade deals focused on critical minerals as a solution, and she suggested that these could be done without the approval of Congress. She emphasized that the intent of the law was not for the United States to steal jobs from Europe and that the law was meant to be aligned with the administration’s “friend-shoring” agenda.
“I think the word ‘free trade’ was meant to mean reliable friends and partners with whom we can feel we have secure supply chains,” Yellen said on the sidelines of the Group of 20 finance ministers meetings in India last month. “We’ve been very clear with Europe that this is not a subsidy war.”
With input from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, officials from the Treasury Department have prepared a document spelling out what kind of deal would constitute a “free-trade agreement” for the purposes of the legislation, according to people familiar with the plans.
It is not clear how quickly the solution could be completed, however, as the white paper said the Treasury Department and the IRS would seek public comment on “what criteria should be used to identify free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement.”
In a briefing Friday, a European official said Europe and the United States could announce by the end of this week a commitment to forge a new limited trade deal, most likely focused on supply chains for critical minerals. Unlike a traditional free-trade agreement, which entails reducing barriers to trade between partners, this agreement would not involve lowering tariffs on either side, and the parties would aim to flesh out the agreement in days or weeks, rather than months, the European official said.
The official added that the agreement would need to be legally binding, and would still involve seeking some type of approval from European Union member states. In the United States, the agreement could come in the form of an executive order from the Biden administration, without requiring the approval of Congress, the official suggested.
One irony is that neither the European Union nor the United States is a major source of the critical minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries. But some officials have suggested that the partnership would form a foundation for a group that could be expanded over time to include countries with larger supplies of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other minerals.
In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, von der Leyen spoke about building “a critical raw materials club” with like-minded partners, including the United States, to strengthen supply chains and overcome China’s “existing monopoly.”
While analysts said a new deal with Europe could in practice satisfy the requirements of the law, it would not really resemble a free-trade agreement, as such agreements have come to be understood.
Free-trade deals are legal agreements that the World Trade Organization defines as covering “substantially all trade” between countries, including a broad range of goods and, typically, services. They usually take years to negotiate and, in the United States, require the approval of Congress.
Scott Lincicome, the director of general economics at the Cato Institute, said that the Biden administration’s authority to strike such trade pacts was questionable but that it was unlikely that anyone would try to mount a legal challenge to them.
“Everyone in the room knows that this is not kosher, but there’s not really anything anybody can do about it,” Lincicome said.
Political appetite for striking new free-trade deals has diminished in the United States in recent years, in part because of a perception that such pacts have helped multinational corporations move factories and jobs offshore.
Efforts to strike expansive trade deals with Europe and a group of Asian countries during the Obama administration fizzled, in part because of that political opposition. During the Trump administration, the United States signed a series of limited trade deals with South Korea, Japan and China that were carried out through executive orders, not by congressional approval.
Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the limited deal would mollify the Europeans, and that U.S.-EU economic relations were too important “to not allow the Europeans under the tent in some way or another.” But it could escalate complaints from other trading partners, like South Korea, that don’t feel as though their concerns have been taken care of, he said.
South Korea has a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the United States, but it has other criticisms of the climate law, centering on how the current terms exclude electric vehicles made by Hyundai from receiving tax credits. “Once you make accommodations for one, the pressure grows to make accommodations for others,” Alden said.
It remains unclear how Congress will respond. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the administration is not adhering to the law’s original intent of promoting U.S. manufacturing. Many also disapprove of efforts by the executive branch to bypass congressional authority in approving trade deals.
But Democrats may also be sympathetic to the effort to smooth over relations with Europeans, and reluctant to reopen debate over their signature climate legislation. And at least one key lawmaker, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has said he didn’t realize that the European Union lacked a free-trade agreement with the United States in the first place.
Still, the dispute has elicited some criticism that American officials are going to great lengths to mollify Europeans, especially given that the European Union imposes some trade barriers on the United States, like a relatively high tariff on imported U.S. cars.
John G. Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said it was his group’s view that the Biden administration should fight against various EU policies that discriminate against American companies “with the same doggedness European officials have brought to their complaints about the IRA.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A.I. Regulation Can Be Puzzle To Lawmakers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tech innovations are again racing ahead of Washington's ability to regulate them, lawmakers and A.I. experts said.
In recent weeks, two members of Congress have sounded the alarm over the dangers of artificial intelligence.
Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in January that he was "freaked out" by the ability of the ChatGPT chatbot to mimic human writers. Another Democrat, Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, gave a one-minute speech -- written by a chatbot -- calling for regulation of A.I.
But even as lawmakers put a spotlight on the technology, few are taking action on it. No bill has been proposed to protect individuals or thwart the development of A.I.'s potentially dangerous aspects. And legislation introduced in recent years to curb A.I. applications like facial recognition have withered in Congress.
The problem is that most lawmakers do not even know what A.I. is, said Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican and the only member of Congress with a master's degree in artificial intelligence.
"Before regulation, there needs to be agreement on what the dangers are, and that requires a deep understanding of what A.I. is," he said. "You'd be surprised how much time I spend explaining to my colleagues that the chief dangers of A.I. will not come from evil robots with red lasers coming out of their eyes."
The inaction over A.I. is part of a familiar pattern, in which technology is again outstripping U.S. rule-making and regulation. Lawmakers have long struggled to understand new innovations, once describing the internet as a "series of tubes." For just as long, companies have worked to slow down regulations, saying the industry needs few roadblocks as the United States competes with China for tech leadership.
That means Washington is taking a hands-off stance as an A.I. boom has gripped Silicon Valley, with Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta racing one another to develop the technology. The spread of A.I., which has spawned chatbots that can write poetry and cars that drive themselves, has provoked a debate over its limits, with some fearing that the technology can eventually replace humans in jobs or even become sentient.
Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, a London organization focused on the responsible use of technology, said a lack of regulation encouraged companies to put a priority on financial and commercial interests at the expense of safety.
"By failing to establish such guardrails, policymakers are creating the conditions for a race to the bottom in irresponsible A.I.," she said.
In the regulatory vacuum, the European Union has taken a leadership role. In 2021, E.U. policymakers proposed a law focused on regulating the A.I. technologies that might create the most harm, such as facial recognition and applications linked to critical public infrastructure like the water supply. The measure, which is expected to be passed as soon as this year, would require makers of A.I. to conduct risk assessments of how their applications could affect health, safety and individual rights, like freedom of expression.
Companies that violated the law could be fined up to 6 percent of their global revenue, which could total billions of dollars for the world's largest tech platforms. E.U. policymakers said the law was needed to maximize artificial intelligence's benefits while minimizing its societal risks.
"We're at the beginning of understanding this technology and weighing its great benefits and potential dangers," said Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, who recently began taking evening college classes on A.I.
Mr. Beyer said U.S. lawmakers would examine the European bill for ideas on regulation and added, "This will take time."
In fact, the federal government has been deeply involved in A.I. for more than six decades. In the 1960s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, began funding research and development of the technology. The support helped lead to military applications like drones and cybersecurity tools.
Criticism of A.I. was largely muted in Washington until January 2015 when the physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and now the owner of Twitter, warned that A.I. was becoming dangerously intelligent and could lead to the end of the human race. They called for regulations.
In November 2016, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness held the first congressional hearing on A.I., with Mr. Musk's warnings cited twice by lawmakers. During the hearing, academics and the chief executive of OpenAI, a San Francisco lab, batted down Mr. Musk's predictions or said they were at least many years away.
Some lawmakers stressed the importance of the nation's leadership in A.I. development. Congress must "ensure that the United States remains a global leader throughout the 21st century," Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and chair of the subcommittee, said at the time.
DARPA subsequently announced that it was earmarking $ 2 billion for A.I. research projects.
Warnings about A.I.'s dangers intensified in 2021 as the Vatican, IBM and Microsoft pledged to develop "ethical A.I.," which means organizations are transparent about how the technology works, respect privacy and minimize biases. The group called for regulation of facial recognition software, which uses large databases of photos to pinpoint people's identity. In Washington, some lawmakers tried creating rules for facial recognition technology and for company audits to prevent discriminatory algorithms. The bills went nowhere.
"It's not a priority and doesn't feel urgent for members," said Mr. Beyer, who failed to get enough support last year to pass a bill on audits of A.I. algorithms, sponsored with Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York.
More recently, some government officials have tried bridging the knowledge gap around A.I. In January, about 150 lawmakers and their staffs packed a meeting, hosted by the usually sleepy A.I. Caucus, that featured Jack Clark, a founder of the A.I. company Anthropic.

Some action around A.I. is taking place in federal agencies, which are enforcing laws already on the books. The Federal Trade Commission has brought enforcement orders against companies that used A.I. in violation of its consumer protection rules. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also warned that opaque A.I. systems used by credit agencies could run afoul of anti-discrimination laws.
The F.T.C. has also proposed commercial surveillance regulations to curb the collection of data used in A.I. technology, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a list of A.I. technology in medical devices that come under its purview.
In October, the White House issued a blueprint for rules on A.I., stressing the rights of individuals to privacy and safe automated systems, protection from algorithmic discrimination and meaningful human alternatives.
But none of the efforts have amounted to laws.
"The picture in Congress is bleak," said Amba Kak, the executive director of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit research center, who recently advised the F.T.C. "The stakes are high because these tools are used in very sensitive social domains like in hiring, housing and credit, and there is real evidence that over the years, A.I. tools have been flawed and biased."
Tech companies have lobbied against policies that would limit how they used A.I. and have called for mostly voluntary regulations.
In 2020, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, the parent of Google, visited Brussels to argue for "sensible regulation" that would not hold back the technology's potential benefits. That same year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and more than 30 companies, including Amazon and Meta, lobbied against facial recognition bills, according to OpenSecrets.org.
"We aren't anti-regulation, but we'd want smart regulation," said Jordan Crenshaw, a vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, which has argued that the draft E.U. law is overly broad and could hamper tech development.
In January, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, visited several members of Congress to demonstrate GPT-4, a new A.I. model that can write essays, solve complex coding problems and more, according to Mr. Beyer and Mr. Lieu. Mr. Altman, who has said he supports regulation, showed how GPT-4 will have greater security controls than previous A.I. models, the lawmakers said.
Mr. Lieu, who met with Mr. Altman, said the government couldn't rely on individual companies to protect users. He plans to introduce a bill this year for a commission to study A.I. and for a new agency to regulate it.
"OpenAI decided to put controls into its technology, but what is to guarantee another company will do the same?" he asked.

Full text: Payment apps and touch screens have made it easy for merchants to ask us for preset gratuity amounts. We don't need to succumb to the pressure.
You might be wondering why I, a tech columnist, would write about tipping. The reason is that tipping is no longer just a socioeconomic and ethical issue about the livelihoods of service workers.
It has also become a tech problem that is rapidly spiraling out of control thanks to the proliferation of digital payment products from companies like Square and Toast. Since payment apps and touch screens make it simple for merchants to preset gratuity amounts, many businesses that didn't ordinarily ask for tips now do.
And many consumers feel pressured to oblige or don't notice the charges. This phenomenon -- known as "guilt tipping" -- was compounded in recent years when more privileged professionals shelled out extra to help essential workers weather the pandemic. But even as businesses have somewhat returned to normal, the gratuity requests have remained steadfast.
Tipping practices may become part of a broad government crackdown on so-called junk fees, extra costs that businesses tack on to products and services while adding little to no value. The Federal Trade Commission, which announced an investigation into the practices last year, said people could experience "junk fee shock" when companies used deceptive tech designs to inflate costs at the end of a purchase.
I have felt the pain and awkwardness of seemingly arbitrary tip requests. I was recently taken aback when a grocery store's iPad screen suggested a tip between 10 percent and 30 percent -- a situation that was made more unpleasant when I hit the "no tip" button and the cashier shot me a glare.
When a motorcycle mechanic asked for a gratuity with his smartphone screen, I felt pressured to tip because my safety depended on his services. (It still felt wrong, because I had already paid for his labor.)
I shared these instances, along with stories I had read all over the web about consumers outraged by abnormal tipping requests, with user-interface experts who work on tech and financial products. All agreed that while it was good that payment services had increased gratuities for service workers who rely on them, the technology created a bad experience when consumers felt coerced by businesses that didn't normally expect tips.
"If your users are not happy, it's going to come back and bite you," said Tony Hu, a director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who teaches courses on product design. "Ideally they should be tipping for an excellent experience."
Based on my conversations with design gurus, there's an upside to all of this. If we focus on the tech design aspects of tipping, we can overcome the pressure of tipping in the same way that we grapple with issues like digital privacy. Let me explain.
The devil is in the defaults.
In 2013, Square released a point-of-sales product that replaced cash registers by letting vendors input an order into a tablet and letting customers swipe a credit card to add their signature and tip. Square has said its products have led to big increases in tips for many businesses. Its technology has since been widely copied by many brands, and traditional cash registers are a rare sighting.
A key driver of the success of digital payment systems, design experts said, is that they take advantage of a design principle that influences consumer behavior: The default is the path of least resistance.
Payment technologies allow merchants to show a set of default tipping amounts -- for example, buttons for 15 percent, 20 percent and 30 percent, along with the "no tip" or "custom tip" button. That setup makes it simplest for us to choose a generous tip, rather than a smaller one or no tip at all.
Plenty of studies document this type of behavior. Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM, Xerox PARC and elsewhere, led past research on encouraging people to register to vote. He found that they were more likely to register if that option was preselected when they filled out applications for driver's licenses and address changes. In other words, people were much more likely to not opt out than they were to opt in.
A Square spokeswoman said the company's payment technology does not allow merchants to preselect a tip amount (except when tips are automatically added for large groups in a restaurant, an industry standard). But in my experience, some of Square's copycats allow merchants to do so.
A broader issue remains: When businesses that don't ordinarily get tips use technology to present a tipping screen, they require the consumer to opt out.
"It's coercion," Mr. Selker said.
On the bright side, the gratuity screens are not considered deceptive, said Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, because the "custom tip" and "no tip" buttons are roughly the same size as the tipping buttons. If the opt-out buttons were extremely difficult to find, this would be an abusive practice known as "dark patterns."
Still, if people feel unfairly pressured into tipping in situations where gratuity is unnecessary, government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission should examine that concern through a regulatory lens, Mr. Brignull said.
The F.T.C. did not immediately return requests for comment.
Treat tipping the way you treat tech.
I recommend approaching tipping the same way that you might approach technology: Be wary of the defaults, and decide when it's right to opt out.
In a past column, I went over the default settings that I and other technology writers always change on our devices and social networking accounts to minimize the data we share with tech companies. The moral of the story was that we can exert some control over our personal information -- we just have to know where to look and do extra work.
The same principle can be applied to tipping in the digital age. When a business asks for a tip, that technology is nothing but an emotionless piece of software showing numbers. You, too, can be neutral and objective when deciding whether to tip and, if so, how much.
"They're objectifying the transaction when the whole point of tipping is to personalize it," Mr. Selker said. "Your mind-set should be is this really what you want to do?"
The best way to avoid feeling controlled by a screen, he added, is to tip in cash whenever a gratuity feels necessary.
If you're unhappy about how a merchant uses tech to demand tips, you can also boycott it (though this might be impractical now that so many businesses use this tech). That's not too different from the action of people who deactivated their Facebook accounts when they felt their privacy was violated.
Even design experts are occasionally caught off guard by the defaults on tipping screens. Mr. Hu of M.I.T. said he had recently been presented with tipping options of $ 1, $ 3 and $ 5 after a $ 10 Uber ride. He chose the middle button, $ 3, before realizing he would normally tip the driver 20 percent, or $ 2.
"It's psychological mind games," he said.

Armies Pared, Europe Lacks Tanks for Kyiv: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The struggle to deliver on promises to provide Leopard 2 tanks for use against Russian forces has exposed just how unprepared European militaries are.
BERLIN -- Nearly a month after Berlin gave European allies permission to send German-made tanks to Ukraine, the flow of tanks so many leaders vowed would follow seems more like a trickle.
Some nations have discovered that the tanks in their armory don't actually work or lack spare parts. Political leaders have encountered unanticipated resistance within their own coalitions, and even from their defense ministries. And some armies had to pull trainers out of retirement to teach Ukrainian soldiers how to use old-model tanks.
The struggle to provide Leopard tanks to an embattled Ukraine is just the most glaring manifestation of a reality Europe has long ignored: Believing that large-scale land war was a thing of the past and basking in the thaw of the Cold War, nations chronically underfunded their militaries. When Russia launched the largest land war on the continent since World War II, they were woefully unprepared.
Hints of the problem have surfaced repeatedly since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, through shortages of weapons and ammunition. But now, as Germany and its allies struggled for weeks to scrape together enough Leopard 2s to fill two battalions of tanks -- 62 vehicles in total -- the extent of their quandary has become even clearer.
The irony of this situation is not lost on Germany.
For weeks, Chancellor Olaf Scholz resisted an intense public pressure campaign from Ukraine's leaders, European politicians and security experts to supply Kyiv with tanks, and to permit other nations to send some of their own Leopards, despite German concerns that it could be perceived by Russia as a NATO escalation. Many goaded Mr. Scholz with a social media campaign: #Freetheleopards.
The Leopards may be free now, but they are scarce on the ground. And some countries that clamored for permission to send them to Ukraine are having difficulties doing so, or second thoughts of their own.
Despite Europe having an estimated 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks of different models -- they are among the most commonly used main battle tanks across the continent -- pledges for Ukraine are still short of the hundreds it says it needs.
Germany has offered 18, and Poland another 14, but the numbers drop from there. And once the currently pledged tanks go into battle and get hit or break down, it is not clear which Leopards -- or which country -- will replace them.
"Of course some nations have delivered, or at least announced that they will," Germany's defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said at the Munich Security Conference this month. "But others have not done that."
"That is what I'm a bit shocked about," he added. "Clearly there were some nations -- and I will never name names here -- but we had some nations that preferred to hide behind Germany. To say: We would love to, if we were allowed. But when we allowed it, they didn't do anything."
Privately, many German and European officials involved in the negotiations over tank deliveries say the situation is more complicated. It is not so much that nations are unwilling to make good on their promises but rather that they have faced a rude awakening as to just how difficult it is.
Finland, where many outspoken members of Parliament led the calls for Germany to allow Leopard deliveries, announced on Thursday that it would supply three Leopard mine-clearing vehicles -- but none of its estimated 200 Leopard main battle tanks.
Some German officials expressed sympathy for Finland, which is not yet a NATO member and has Europe's longest border with Russia, some 830 miles. It does not want to weaken its defenses now that Russia has shown a willingness to attack a sovereign neighbor.
But some European officials were hoping for a larger contribution from Finland, given promises from the United States and Britain to come to its defense if necessary, even before NATO accession.
Nordic countries such as Sweden, which had long pushed for Leopard deliveries but on Friday offered only "up to" 10, are facing another unexpected problem, several German officials said: While their politicians and members of the public appear keen to offer tanks to Ukraine, their militaries are not.
For decades, European countries enjoying a post-Cold War "peace dividend" had seen war as almost a thing of the past, regularly cutting military support. Now, the shrunken armies tend to be protective of what they still have. At NATO, European militaries are sometimes called "bonsai armies," after the miniature trees.
For years, the United States has been nagging Europe to increase military spending, and in 2014, after Russia grabbed Crimea, NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Yet even today, by current NATO estimates, only nine of the alliance's 30 members are spending that much, while a 10th is close. Thirteen countries, including Germany, were spending around 1.5 percent of their G.D.P. or even less.
In Germany, which for years clung to a foreign policy that emphasized aid and development more than hard power, some saw the problem as uniquely German. Yearly military reports to Parliament offered sometimes comical glimpses of the shortages. Commandos conducted water training at local public pools, because their own facilities were shut down. Planes could not fly. Soldiers trained with broomsticks instead of rifles. Even newer Puma infantry fighting vehicles recently broke down en masse.
But other European nations are now realizing their own militaries may have similar troubles.
"The trend across the board in European armies has been cutting, cutting, cutting," said Christian Mölling, a defense expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. "But at the end of the day, many were on the same track as Germany: War is a theoretical thing. So we have theoretical tanks."
Spain, which has 108 Leopard 2A4 tanks, early on sought German permission to offer some of its vehicles to Ukraine. Now it has discovered that many of them are in poor condition and need refurbishment that could take weeks or months. On top of that, one of the prime minister's coalition partners, the leftist Podemos party, is closer to Russia and has been resistant to offering more support for Ukraine.
Nevertheless, as Germany turned the pressure back on its allies for their shortcomings, Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, on Friday improved on his promise to send six Leopards and said Spain would now send 10.
Ulrike Franke, a defense analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the struggle to find tank numbers raises questions as to where else European militaries face similar shortages and maintenance problems.
"Is it just bad luck that Spain has an issue with their Leopard tanks, but everything else works?" she said. "Or do they have the same issues elsewhere?"
"Does 10 percent of their equipment not work, or is it 50 percent?" Ms. Franke asked. "It would be a good idea for Europeans to look at this more closely."
Poland, which has difficult relations with Germany, was foremost in pressing Mr. Scholz and Berlin on the Leopards, and even threatened to send some to Ukraine without the necessary German permission. Like Berlin, Warsaw has some 200 Leopard 2 tanks -- but it says it will provide just 14. It sent the first of the tanks to Ukraine on the anniversary of the invasion, Feb. 24, although Poland has yet to finish training Ukrainian soldiers how to use them.
Warsaw may be holding off on deliveries of Leopards until it receives new Hyundai-made K2 tanks from South Korea, meant to replace the German model, some analysts said. Poland has sent many upgraded Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine.
But some European officials think Warsaw should be offering more Leopards, and some policymakers are planning meetings with Polish officials this week to better understand the situation. Even when it comes to the tanks that are in large supply -- namely, the older Leopard 1 models -- there are complications.
The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark have launched a joint initiative to refurbish and send 150 Leopard 1 models to Ukraine by the end of the year. But at a training session for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany earlier this week, one general said militaries had been forced to seek out retired Leopard 1 tank drivers to come back and help train Ukrainian forces. The old model is too unfamiliar to current militaries.
As politicized as the Leopard issue has become, Gustav Gressel, a security analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that there were plenty of solutions if European nations worked together.
The Dutch, for instance, lease 18 Leopards from Germany. Officials are discussing whether it would be possible for Germany to take some of them to use in place of its own Leopards in Lithuania and then send those to Ukraine.
Switzerland, sticking to its constitutional neutrality, refuses to send any of its 134 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. But it is willing to give the tanks to European Union members, Mr. Gressel said. Countries like Finland or Poland, he said, could request the Swiss tanks and send their own to Ukraine.
Another option would be for countries to simply buy more Leopards, made by the German companies Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, and send their current models to Ukraine. But European governments and the defense industry are currently in a standoff over production.
State leaders want industry to move first, while weapons makers want longer-term government orders before they step up production. If more government orders are made, analysts say, the more capacity may increase, thus speeding up production of weapons like tanks.
At current rates, militaries would face a serious tank shortage for the two to three years it would take the industry to make the new vehicles, security experts say -- a long waiting period politicians across Europe are learning their armies are fiercely resistant to accept.
That is why Mr. Gressel argued the tanks should be sent now anyway.
"Yes," he said, "Russia will reconstitute itself as a military threat to NATO after this war. But it will take years for them to come back as a military threat. They have to rebuild an army which is shattered and almost destroyed in Ukraine."

As A.I. Text Detection Gets Better, So Does A.I. Text: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In a World of A.I.-Generated Text, How Will We Know What's Real?
When artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT writes, it considers many options for each word, taking into account the response it has written so far and the question being asked.
It assigns a score to each option on the list, which quantifies how likely the word is to come next, based on the vast amount of human-written text it has analyzed.
ChatGPT, which is built on what is known as a large language model, then chooses a word with a high score, and moves on to the next one.
The model's output is often so sophisticated that it can seem like the chatbot understands what it is saying -- but it does not.
Every choice it makes is determined by complex math and huge amounts of data. So much so that it often produces text that is both coherent and accurate.
But when ChatGPT says something that is untrue, it inherently does not realize it.
It may soon become common to encounter a tweet, essay or news article and wonder if it was written by artificial intelligence software. There could be questions over the authorship of a given piece of writing, like in academic settings, or the veracity of its content, in the case of an article.
There could also be questions about authenticity: If a misleading idea suddenly appears in posts across the internet, is it spreading organically, or have the posts been generated by A.I. to create the appearance of real traction?
Tools to identify whether a piece of text was written by A.I. have started to emerge in recent months, including one created by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. That tool uses an A.I. model trained to spot differences between generated and human-written text.
When OpenAI tested the tool, it correctly identified A.I. text in only about half of the generated writing samples it analyzed. The company said at the time that it had released the experimental detector "to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful."
Identifying generated text, experts say, is becoming increasingly difficult as software like ChatGPT continues to advance and turns out text that is more convincingly human. OpenAI is now experimenting with a technology that would insert special words into the text that ChatGPT generates, making it easier to detect later. The technique is known as watermarking.
The watermarking method that OpenAI is exploring is similar to one described in a recent paper by researchers at the University of Maryland, said Jan Leike, the head of alignment at OpenAI. Here is how it works.
Imagine a list of every word you know, every unique word you might use when writing an essay, email or text message.
Now imagine that half of those words are on a special list. If you wrote a couple of paragraphs, about half of the words you used would probably be on the special list, statistically speaking.
When a language model or chatbot writes, it can insert a watermark by choosing more of the words on the special list than a person would be expected to use.
The text here was generated by the researchers at the University of Maryland who wrote the watermarking paper. They used a technique that essentially bumped up the scores of the words on the special list, making the generator more likely to use them.
When the generator got to this point in the text, it would have chosen the word "the." But the word "who" was on the special list, and its score was artificially increased enough to overtake the word "the."
When the generator got here, the words "Tuesday," "Thursday" and "Friday" were on the special list -- but their scores were not increased so much that they overtook "Saturday," which was by design. For watermarking to work well, it should not overrule an A.I. on its choice of words when it comes to dates or names, to avoid inserting falsehoods. (Although, in this case, the A.I. was wrong: Ms. Williams's final match was indeed on a Friday.)
In the end, about 70 percent of the words in the generated text were on the special list -- far more than would have been in text written by a person. A detection tool that knew which words were on the special list would be able to tell the difference between generated text and text written by a person.
That would be especially helpful for this generated text, as it includes several factual inaccuracies.
If someone tried to remove a watermark by editing the text, they would not know which words to change. And even if they managed to change some of the special words, they would most likely only reduce the total percentage by a couple of points.
Tom Goldstein, a professor at the University of Maryland and co-author of the watermarking paper, said a watermark could be detected even from "a very short text fragment," such as a tweet. By contrast, the detection tool OpenAI released requires a minimum of 1,000 characters.
Like all approaches to detection, however, watermarking is not perfect, Dr. Goldstein said. OpenAI's current detection tool is trained to identify text generated by 34 different language models, while a watermark detector could only identify text that was produced by a model or chatbot that uses the same list of special words as the detector itself.
That means that unless companies in the A.I. field agree on a standard watermark implementation, the method could lead to a future where questionable text must be checked against several different watermark detection tools.
To make watermarking work well every time in a widely used product like ChatGPT, without reducing the quality of its output, would require a lot of engineering, Dr. Goldstein said.
Dr. Leike of OpenAI said the company was still researching watermarking as a form of detection, and added that it could complement the current tool, since the two "have different strengths and weaknesses."
Still, many experts believe a one-stop tool that can reliably detect all A.I. text with total accuracy may be out of reach. That is partly because tools could emerge that could help remove evidence that a piece of text was generated by A.I. And generated text, even if it is watermarked, would be harder to detect in cases where it makes up only a small portion of a larger piece of writing.
Experts also say that detection tools, especially those that do not use watermarking, may not recognize generated text if a person has changed it enough.
"I think the idea that there's going to be a magic tool, either created by the vendor of the model or created by an external third party, that's going to take away doubt -- I don't think we're going to have the luxury of living in that world," said David Cox, a director of the MIT-IBM Watson A.I. Lab.
Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, shared a similar sentiment in an interview with StrictlyVC last month.
"Fundamentally, I think it's impossible to make it perfect," Mr. Altman said. "People will figure out how much of the text they have to change. There will be other things that modify the outputted text."
Part of the problem, Dr. Cox said, is that detection tools themselves present a conundrum, in that they could make it easier to avoid detection. A person could repeatedly edit generated text and check it against a detection tool until the text is identified as human-written -- and that process could potentially be automated. Detection technology, Dr. Cox added, will always be a step behind as new language models emerge, and as existing ones advance.
"This is always going to have an element of an arms race to it," he said. "It's always going to be the case that new models will come out and people will develop ways to detect that it's a fake."
Some experts believe that OpenAI and other companies building chatbots should come up with solutions for detection before they release A.I. products, rather than after. OpenAI launched ChatGPT at the end of November, for example, but did not release its detection tool until about two months later, at the end of January.
By that time, educators and researchers had already been calling for tools to help them identify generated text. Many signed up to use a new detection tool, GPTZero, which was built by a Princeton University student over his winter break and was released on Jan. 1.
"We've heard from an overwhelming number of teachers," said Edward Tian, the student who built GPTZero. As of mid-February, more than 43,000 teachers had signed up to use the tool, Mr. Tian said.
"Generative A.I. is an incredible technology, but for any new innovation we need to build the safeguards for it to be adopted responsibly, not months or years after the release, but immediately when it is released," Mr. Tian said.

Full text: By Keith Collins
When artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT writes, it considers many options for each word, taking into account the response it has written so far and the question being asked.
It assigns a score to each option on the list, which quantifies how likely the word is to come next, based on the vast amount of human-written text it has analyzed.
ChatGPT, which is built on what is known as a large language model, then chooses a word with a high score, and moves on to the next one.
The model's output is often so sophisticated that it can seem like the chatbot understands what it is saying -- but it does not.
Every choice it makes is determined by complex math and huge amounts of data. So much so that it often produces text that is both coherent and accurate.
But when ChatGPT says something that is untrue, it inherently does not realize it.
It may soon become common to encounter a tweet, essay or news article and wonder if it was written by artificial intelligence software. There could be questions over the authorship of a given piece of writing, like in academic settings, or the veracity of its content, in the case of an article.
There could also be questions about authenticity: If a misleading idea suddenly appears in posts across the internet, is it spreading organically, or have the posts been generated by A.I. to create the appearance of real traction?
Tools to identify whether a piece of text was written by A.I. have started to emerge in recent months, including one created by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. That tool uses an A.I. model trained to spot differences between generated and human-written text.
When OpenAI tested the tool, it correctly identified A.I. text in only about half of the generated writing samples it analyzed. The company said at the time that it had released the experimental detector "to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful."
Identifying generated text, experts say, is becoming increasingly difficult as software like ChatGPT continues to advance and turns out text that is more convincingly human. OpenAI is now experimenting with a technology that would insert special words into the text that ChatGPT generates, making it easier to detect later. The technique is known as watermarking.
The watermarking method that OpenAI is exploring is similar to one described in a recent paper by researchers at the University of Maryland, said Jan Leike, the head of alignment at OpenAI. Here is how it works.
Imagine a list of every word you know, every unique word you might use when writing an essay, email or text message.
Now imagine that half of those words are on a special list. If you wrote a couple of paragraphs, about half of the words you used would probably be on the special list, statistically speaking.
When a language model or chatbot writes, it can insert a watermark by choosing more of the words on the special list than a person would be expected to use.
The text here was generated by the researchers at the University of Maryland who wrote the watermarking paper. They used a technique that essentially bumped up the scores of the words on the special list, making the generator more likely to use them.
When the generator got to this point in the text, it would have chosen the word "the." But the word "who" was on the special list, and its score was artificially increased enough to overtake the word "the."
When the generator got here, the words "Tuesday," "Thursday" and "Friday" were on the special list -- but their scores were not increased so much that they overtook "Saturday," which was by design. For watermarking to work well, it should not overrule an A.I. on its choice of words when it comes to dates or names, to avoid inserting falsehoods. (Although, in this case, the A.I. was wrong: Ms. Williams's final match was indeed on a Friday.)
In the end, about 70 percent of the words in the generated text were on the special list -- far more than would have been in text written by a person. A detection tool that knew which words were on the special list would be able to tell the difference between generated text and text written by a person.
That would be especially helpful for this generated text, as it includes several factual inaccuracies.
If someone tried to remove a watermark by editing the text, they would not know which words to change. And even if they managed to change some of the special words, they would most likely only reduce the total percentage by a couple of points.
Tom Goldstein, a professor at the University of Maryland and co-author of the watermarking paper, said a watermark could be detected even from "a very short text fragment," such as a tweet. By contrast, the detection tool OpenAI released requires a minimum of 1,000 characters.
Like all approaches to detection, however, watermarking is not perfect, Dr. Goldstein said. OpenAI's current detection tool is trained to identify text generated by 34 different language models, while a watermark detector could only identify text that was produced by a model or chatbot that uses the same list of special words as the detector itself.
That means that unless companies in the A.I. field agree on a standard watermark implementation, the method could lead to a future where questionable text must be checked against several different watermark detection tools.
To make watermarking work well every time in a widely used product like ChatGPT, without reducing the quality of its output, would require a lot of engineering, Dr. Goldstein said.
Dr. Leike of OpenAI said the company was still researching watermarking as a form of detection, and added that it could complement the current tool, since the two "have different strengths and weaknesses."
Still, many experts believe a one-stop tool that can reliably detect all A.I. text with total accuracy may be out of reach. That is partly because tools could emerge that could help remove evidence that a piece of text was generated by A.I. And generated text, even if it is watermarked, would be harder to detect in cases where it makes up only a small portion of a larger piece of writing.
Experts also say that detection tools, especially those that do not use watermarking, may not recognize generated text if a person has changed it enough.
"I think the idea that there's going to be a magic tool, either created by the vendor of the model or created by an external third party, that's going to take away doubt -- I don't think we're going to have the luxury of living in that world," said David Cox, a director of the MIT-IBM Watson A.I. Lab.
Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, shared a similar sentiment in an interview with StrictlyVC last month.
"Fundamentally, I think it's impossible to make it perfect," Mr. Altman said. "People will figure out how much of the text they have to change. There will be other things that modify the outputted text."
Part of the problem, Dr. Cox said, is that detection tools themselves present a conundrum, in that they could make it easier to avoid detection. A person could repeatedly edit generated text and check it against a detection tool until the text is identified as human-written -- and that process could potentially be automated. Detection technology, Dr. Cox added, will always be a step behind as new language models emerge, and as existing ones advance.
"This is always going to have an element of an arms race to it," he said. "It's always going to be the case that new models will come out and people will develop ways to detect that it's a fake."
Some experts believe that OpenAI and other companies building chatbots should come up with solutions for detection before they release A.I. products, rather than after. OpenAI launched ChatGPT at the end of November, for example, but did not release its detection tool until about two months later, at the end of January.
By that time, educators and researchers had already been calling for tools to help them identify generated text. Many signed up to use a new detection tool, GPTZero, which was built by a Princeton University student over his winter break and was released on Jan. 1.
"We've heard from an overwhelming number of teachers," said Edward Tian, the student who built GPTZero. As of mid-February, more than 43,000 teachers had signed up to use the tool, Mr. Tian said.
"Generative A.I. is an incredible technology, but for any new innovation we need to build the safeguards for it to be adopted responsibly, not months or years after the release, but immediately when it is released," Mr. Tian said.

Alone, Underage and Exploited for Labor: [National Desk]

Full text: Arriving in record numbers, they're ending up in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws -- including in factories that make products for well-known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom.
It was almost midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich., but inside the factory everything was bright. A conveyor belt carried bags of Cheerios past a cluster of young workers. One was 15-year-old Carolina Yoc, who came to the United States on her own last year to live with a relative she had never met.
About every 10 seconds, she stuffed a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It could be dangerous work, with fast-moving pulleys and gears that had torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp.
The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina, who had crossed the Southern border by themselves and were now spending late hours bent over hazardous machinery, in violation of child labor laws. At nearby plants, other children were tending giant ovens to make Chewy and Nature Valley granola bars and packing bags of Lucky Charms and Cheetos -- all of them working for the processing giant Hearthside Food Solutions, which would ship these products around the country.
"Sometimes I get tired and feel sick," Carolina said after a shift in November. Her stomach often hurt, and she was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incessant roar of the machines, or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. "But I'm getting used to it."
These workers are part of a new economy of exploitation: Migrant children, who have been coming into the United States without their parents in record numbers, are ending up in some of the most punishing jobs in the country, a New York Times investigation found. This shadow work force extends across industries in every state, flouting child labor laws that have been in place for nearly a century. Twelve-year-old roofers in Florida and Tennessee. Underage slaughterhouse workers in Delaware, Mississippi and North Carolina. Children sawing planks of wood on overnight shifts in South Dakota.
Largely from Central America, the children are driven by economic desperation that was worsened by the pandemic. This labor force has been slowly growing for almost a decade, but it has exploded since 2021, while the systems meant to protect children have broken down.
The Times spoke with more than 100 migrant child workers in 20 states who described jobs that were grinding them into exhaustion, and fears that they had become trapped in circumstances they never could have imagined. The Times examination also drew on court and inspection records and interviews with hundreds of lawyers, social workers, educators and law enforcement officials.
In town after town, children scrub dishes late at night. They run milking machines in Vermont and deliver meals in New York City. They harvest coffee and build lava rock walls around vacation homes in Hawaii. Girls as young as 13 wash hotel sheets in Virginia.
In many parts of the country, middle and high school teachers in English-language learner programs say it is now common for nearly all their students to rush off to long shifts after their classes end.
"They should not be working 12-hour days, but it's happening here," said Valeria Lindsay, a language arts teacher at Homestead Middle School near Miami. For the past three years, she said, almost every eighth grader in her English learner program of about 100 students was also carrying an adult workload.
Migrant child labor benefits both under-the-table operations and global corporations, The Times found. In Los Angeles, children stitch "Made in America" tags into J. Crew shirts. They bake dinner rolls sold at Walmart and Target, process milk used in Ben & Jerry's ice cream and help debone chicken sold at Whole Foods. As recently as the fall, middle-schoolers made Fruit of the Loom socks in Alabama. In Michigan, children make auto parts used by Ford and General Motors.
The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States climbed to a high of 130,000 last year -- three times what it was five years earlier -- and this summer is expected to bring another wave.
These are not children who have stolen into the country undetected. The federal government knows they are in the United States, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring sponsors will support them and protect them from trafficking or exploitation.
But as more and more children have arrived, the Biden White House has ramped up demands on staffers to move the children quickly out of shelters and release them to adults. Caseworkers say they rush through vetting sponsors.
While H.H.S. checks on all minors by calling them a month after they begin living with their sponsors, data obtained by The Times showed that over the last two years, the agency could not reach more than 85,000 children. Overall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third of migrant children.
An H.H.S. spokeswoman said the agency wanted to release children swiftly, for the sake of their well-being, but had not compromised safety. "There are numerous places along the process to continually ensure that a placement is in the best interest of the child," said the spokeswoman, Kamara Jones.
Far from home, many of these children are under intense pressure to earn money. They send cash back to their families while often being in debt to their sponsors for smuggling fees, rent and living expenses.
"It's getting to be a business for some of these sponsors," said Annette Passalacqua, who left her job as a caseworker in Central Florida last year. Ms. Passalacqua said she saw so many children put to work, and found law enforcement officials so unwilling to investigate these cases, that she largely stopped reporting them. Instead, she settled for explaining to the children that they were entitled to lunch breaks and overtime.
Sponsors are required to send migrant children to school, and some students juggle classes and heavy workloads. Other children arrive to find that they have been misled by their sponsors and will not be enrolled in school.
The federal government hires child welfare agencies to track some minors who are deemed to be at high risk. But caseworkers at those agencies said that H.H.S. regularly ignored obvious signs of labor exploitation, a characterization the agency disputed.
In interviews with more than 60 caseworkers, most independently estimated that about two-thirds of all unaccompanied migrant children ended up working full time.
A representative for Hearthside said the company relied on a staffing agency to supply some workers for its plants in Grand Rapids, but conceded that it had not required the agency to verify ages through a national system that checks Social Security numbers. Unaccompanied migrant children often obtain false identification to secure work.
"We are immediately implementing additional controls to reinforce all agencies' strict compliance with our longstanding requirement that all workers must be 18 or over," the company said in a statement.
At Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina's ninth-grade social studies teacher, Rick Angstman, has seen the toll that long shifts take on his students. One, who was working nights at a commercial laundry, began passing out in class from fatigue and was hospitalized twice, he said. Unable to stop working, she dropped out of school.
"She disappeared into oblivion," Mr. Angstman said. "It's the new child labor. You're taking children from another country and putting them in almost indentured servitude."
On the Night Shift
When Carolina left Guatemala, she had no real understanding of what she was heading toward, just a sense that she could not stay in her village any longer. There was not much electricity or water, and after the pandemic began, not much food.
The only people who seemed to be getting by were the families living off remittances from relatives in the United States. Carolina lived alone with her grandmother, whose health began failing. When neighbors started talking about heading north, she decided to join. She was 14.
"I just kept walking," she said.
Carolina reached the U.S. border exhausted, weighing 84 pounds. Agents sent her to an H.H.S. shelter in Arizona, where a caseworker contacted her aunt, Marcelina Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez was at first reluctant: She had already sponsored two other relatives and had three children of her own. They were living on $ 600 a week, and she didn't know Carolina.
When Carolina arrived in Grand Rapids last year, Ms. Ramirez told her she would go to school every morning and suggested that she pick up evening shifts at Hearthside. She knew Carolina needed to send money back to her grandmother. She also believed it was good for young people to work. Child labor is the norm in rural Guatemala, and she herself had started working around the second grade.
One of the nation's largest contract manufacturers, Hearthside makes and packages food for companies like Frito-Lay, General Mills and Quaker Oats. "It would be hard to find a cookie or cracker aisle in any leading grocer that does not contain multiple products from Hearthside production facilities," a Grand Rapids-area plant manager told a trade magazine in 2019.
General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Nature Valley, said it recognized "the seriousness of this situation" and was reviewing The Times's findings. PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, declined to comment.
Three people who until last year worked at one of the biggest employment agencies in Grand Rapids, Forge Industrial Staffing, said Hearthside supervisors were sometimes made aware that they were getting young-looking workers whose identities had been flagged as false.
"Hearthside didn't care," said Nubia Malacara, a former Forge employee who said she had also worked at Hearthside as a minor.
In a statement, Hearthside said, "We do care deeply about this issue and are concerned about the mischaracterization of Hearthside." A spokesman for Forge said it complied with state and federal laws and "would never knowingly employ individuals under 18."
Kevin Tomas said he sought work through Forge after he arrived in Grand Rapids at age 13 with his 7-year-old brother. At first, he was sent to a local manufacturer that made auto parts for Ford and General Motors. But his shift ended at 6:30 in the morning, so he could not stay awake in school, and he struggled to lift the heavy boxes.
"It's not that we want to be working these jobs. It's that we have to help our families," Kevin said.
By the time he was 15, Kevin had found a job at Hearthside, stacking 50-pound cases of cereal on the same shift as Carolina.
'So Many Red Flags'
The growth of migrant child labor in the United States over the past several years is a result of a chain of willful ignorance. Companies ignore the young faces in their back rooms and on their factory floors. Schools often decline to report apparent labor violations, believing it will hurt children more than help. And H.H.S. behaves as if the migrant children who melt unseen into the country are doing just fine.
"As the government, we've turned a blind eye to their trafficking," said Doug Gilmer, the head of the Birmingham, Ala., office of Homeland Security Investigations, a federal agency that often becomes involved with immigration cases.
Mr. Gilmer teared up as he recalled finding 13-year-olds working in meat plants; 12-year-olds working at suppliers for Hyundai and Kia, as documented last year by a Reuters investigation; and children who should have been in middle school working at commercial bakeries.
"We're encountering it here because we're looking for it here," Mr. Gilmer said. "It's happening everywhere."
Children have crossed the Southern border on their own for decades, and since 2008, the United States has allowed non-Mexican minors to live with sponsors while they go through immigration proceedings, which can take several years. The policy, codified in anti-trafficking legislation, is intended to prevent harm to children who would otherwise be turned away and left alone in a Mexican border town.
When Kelsey Keswani first worked as an H.H.S. contractor in Arizona to connect unaccompanied migrant children with sponsors in 2010, the adults were almost always the children's parents, who had paid smugglers to bring them up from Central America, she said.
But around 2014, the number of arriving children began to climb, and their circumstances were different. In recent years, "the kids almost all have a debt to pay off, and they're super stressed about it," Ms. Keswani said.
She began to see more failures in the vetting process. "There were so many cases where sponsors had sponsored multiple kids, and it wasn't getting caught. So many red flags with debt. So many reports of trafficking."
Now, just a third of migrant children are going to their parents. A majority are sent to other relatives, acquaintances or even strangers, a Times analysis of federal data showed. Nearly half are coming from Guatemala, where poverty is fueling a wave of migration. Parents know that they would be turned away at the border or quickly deported, so they send their children in hopes that remittances will come back.
In the last two years alone, more than 250,000 children have entered the United States by themselves.
The shifting dynamics in Central America helped create a political crisis early in Mr. Biden's presidency, when children started crossing the border faster than H.H.S. could process them. With no room left in shelters, the children stayed in jail-like facilities run by Customs and Border Protection and, later, in tent cities. The images of children sleeping on gym mats under foil blankets attracted intense media attention.
The Biden administration pledged to move children through the shelter system more quickly. "We don't want to continue to see a child languish in our care if there is a responsible sponsor," Xavier Becerra, secretary of health and human services, told Congress in 2021.
His agency began paring back protections that had been in place for years, including some background checks and reviews of children's files, according to memos reviewed by The Times and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees.
"Twenty percent of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged," said Ms. Keswani, who stopped working with H.H.S. last month.
Concerns piled up in summer 2021 at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the H.H.S. division responsible for unaccompanied migrant children. In a memo that July, 11 managers said they were worried that labor trafficking was increasing and complained to their bosses that the office had become "one that rewards individuals for making quick releases, and not one that rewards individuals for preventing unsafe releases."
Staff members said in interviews that Mr. Becerra continued to push for faster results, often asking why they could not discharge children with machine-like efficiency.
"If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have never become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an assembly line," Mr. Becerra said at a staff meeting last summer, according to a recording obtained by The Times.
The H.H.S. spokeswoman, Ms. Jones, said that Mr. Becerra had urged his staff to "step it up." "Like any good leader, he wouldn't hesitate to do it again -- especially when it comes to the well-being and safety of children," she said.
During a call last March, Mr. Becerra told Cindy Huang, the O.R.R. director, that if she could not increase the number of discharges, he would find someone who could, according to five people familiar with the call. She resigned a month later.
He recently made a similar threat to her successor during a meeting with senior leadership, according to several people who were present.
'It Was All Lies'
While many migrant children are sent to the United States by their parents, others are persuaded to come by adults who plan to profit from their labor.
Nery Cutzal was 13 when he met his sponsor over Facebook Messenger. Once Nery arrived in Florida, he discovered that he owed more than $ 4,000 and had to find his own place to live. His sponsor sent him threatening text messages and kept a running list of new debts: $ 140 for filling out H.H.S. paperwork; $ 240 for clothes from Walmart; $ 45 for a taco dinner.
"Don't mess with me," the sponsor wrote. "You don't mean anything to me."
Nery began working until 3 a.m. most nights at a trendy Mexican restaurant near Palm Beach to make the payments. "He said I would be able to go to school and he would take care of me, but it was all lies," Nery said.
His father, Leonel Cutzal, said the family had become destitute after a series of bad harvests and had no choice but to send their oldest son north from Guatemala.
"Even when he shares $ 50, it's a huge help," Mr. Cutzal said. "Otherwise, there are times we don't eat." Mr. Cutzal had not understood how much Nery would be made to work, he said. "I think he passed through some hard moments being up there so young."
Nery eventually contacted law enforcement, and his sponsor was found guilty last year of smuggling a child into the United States for financial gain. That outcome is rare: In the past decade, federal prosecutors have brought only about 30 cases involving forced labor of unaccompanied minors, according to a Times review of court databases.
Unlike the foster care system, in which all children get case management, H.H.S. provides this service to about a third of children who pass through its care, and usually for just four months. Tens of thousands of other children are sent to their sponsors with little but the phone number for a national hotline. From there, they are often on their own: There is no formal follow-up from any federal or local agencies to ensure that sponsors are not putting children to work illegally.
In Pennsylvania, one case worker told The Times he went to check on a child released to a man who had applied to sponsor 20 other minors. The boy had vanished. In Texas, another case worker said she had encountered a man who had been targeting poor families in Guatemala, promising to help them get rich if they sent their children across the border. He had sponsored 13 children.
"If you've been in this field for any amount of time, you know that there's what the sponsors agree to, and what they're actually doing," said Bernal Cruz Munoz, a caseworker supervisor in Oregon.
Calling the hotline is not a sure way to get support, either. Juanito Ferrer called for help after he was brought to Manassas, Va., at age 15 by an acquaintance who forced him to paint houses during the day and guard an apartment complex at night. His sponsor took his paychecks and watched him on security cameras as he slept on the basement floor.
Juanito said that when he called the hotline in 2019, the person on the other end just took a report. "I thought they'd send the police or someone to check, but they never did that," he said. "I thought they would come and inspect the house, at least." He eventually escaped.
Asked about the hotline, H.H.S. said operators passed reports onto law enforcement and other local agencies because the agency did not have the authority to remove children from homes.
The Times analyzed government data to identify places with high concentrations of children who had been released to people outside their immediate families -- a sign that they might have been expected to work. In northwest Grand Rapids, for instance, 93 percent of children have been released to adults who are not their parents.
H.H.S. does not track these clusters, but the trends are so pronounced that officials sometimes notice hot spots anyway.
Scott Lloyd, who led the resettlement office in the Trump administration, said he realized in 2018 that the number of unaccompanied Guatemalan boys being released to sponsors in South Florida seemed to be growing.
"I always wondered what was happening there," he said.
But his attention was diverted by the chaos around the Trump administration's child separation policy, and he never looked into it. The trend he saw has only accelerated: For example, in the past three years, more than 200 children have been released to distant relatives or unrelated adults around Immokalee, Fla., an agricultural hub with a long history of labor exploitation.
In a statement, H.H.S. said it had updated its case management system to better flag instances when multiple children were being released to the same person or address.
Many sponsors see themselves as benevolent, doing a friend or neighbor a favor by agreeing to help a child get out of a government shelter, even if they do not intend to offer any support. Children often understand that they will have to work, but do not grasp the unrelenting grind that awaits them.
"I didn't get how expensive everything was," said 13-year-old Jose Vasquez, who works 12-hour shifts, six days a week, at a commercial egg farm in Michigan and lives with his teenage sister. "I'd like to go to school, but then how would I pay rent?"
Occupational Hazards
One fall morning at Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina listened to Mr. Angstman lecture on the journalist Jacob Riis and the Progressive Era movement that helped create federal child labor laws. He explained that the changes were meant to keep young people out of jobs that could harm their health or safety, and showed the class a photo of a small boy making cigars.
"Riis reported that members of this family worked 17 hours a day, seven days a week," he told the students. "The cramped space reeked of toxic fumes." Students seemed unmoved. Some struggled to stay awake.
Teachers at the school estimated that 200 of their immigrant students were working full time while trying to keep up with their classes. The greatest share of Mr. Angstman's students worked at one of the four Hearthside plants in the city.
The company, which has 39 factories in the United States, has been cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 34 violations since 2019, including for unsafe conveyor belts at the plant where Carolina found her job. At least 11 workers suffered amputations in that time. In 2015, a machine caught the hairnet of an Ohio worker and ripped off part of her scalp.
The history of accidents "shows a corporate culture that lacks urgency to keep workers safe," an OSHA official wrote after the most recent violation for an amputation.
Underage workers in Grand Rapids said that spicy dust from immense batches of Flamin' Hot Cheetos made their lungs sting, and that moving heavy pallets of cereal all night made their backs ache. They worried about their hands getting caught in conveyor belts, which federal law classifies as so hazardous that no child Carolina's age is permitted to work with them.
Hearthside said in a statement that it was committed to complying with laws governing worker protections. "We strongly dispute the safety allegations made and are proud of our safety-first culture," the statement read.
Federal law bars minors from a long list of dangerous jobs, including roofing, meat processing and commercial baking. Except on farms, children younger than 16 are not supposed to work for more than three hours or after 7 p.m. on school days.
But these jobs -- which are grueling and poorly paid, and thus chronically short-staffed -- are exactly where many migrant children are ending up. Adolescents are twice as likely as adults to be seriously injured at work, yet recently arrived preteens and teenagers are running industrial dough mixers, driving massive earthmovers and burning their hands on hot tar as they lay down roofing shingles, The Times found.
Unaccompanied minors have had their legs torn off in factories and their spines shattered on construction sites, but most of these injuries go uncounted. The Labor Department tracks the deaths of foreign-born child workers but no longer makes them public. Reviewing state and federal safety records and public reports, The Times found a dozen cases of young migrant workers killed since 2017, the last year the Labor Department reported any.
The deaths include a 14-year-old food delivery worker who was hit by a car while on his bike at a Brooklyn intersection; a 16-year-old who was crushed under a 35-ton tractor-scraper outside Atlanta; and a 15-year-old who fell 50 feet from a roof in Alabama where he was laying down shingles.
In 2021, Karla Campbell, a Nashville labor lawyer, helped a woman figure out how to transport the body of her 14-year-old grandson, who had been killed on a landscaping job, back to his village in Guatemala. It was the second child labor death she had handled that year.
"I've been working on these cases for 15 years, and the addition of children is new," Ms. Campbell said.
In dairy production, the injury rate is twice the national average across all industries. Paco Calvo arrived in Middlebury, Vt., when he was 14 and has been working 12-hour days on dairy farms in the four years since. He said he crushed his hand in an industrial milking machine in the first months of doing this work.
"Pretty much everyone gets hurt when they first start," he said.
Targeting the Middlemen
Charlene Irizarry, the human resources manager at Farm Fresh Foods, an Alabama meat plant that struggles to retain staff, recently realized she was interviewing a 12-year-old for a job slicing chicken breasts into nuggets in a section of the factory kept at 40 degrees.
Ms. Irizarry regularly sees job applicants who use heavy makeup or medical masks to try to hide their youth, she said. "Sometimes their legs don't touch the floor."
Other times, an adult will apply for a job in the morning, and then a child using the same name will show up for orientation that afternoon. She and her staff have begun separating other young applicants from the adults who bring them in, so they will admit their real ages.
Ms. Irizarry said the plant had already been fined for one child labor violation, and she was trying to avoid another. But she wondered what the children might face if she turned them away.
"I worry about why they're so desperate for these jobs," she said.
In interviews with underage migrant workers, The Times found child labor in the American supply chains of many major brands and retailers. Several, including Ford, General Motors, J. Crew and Walmart, as well as their suppliers, said they took the allegations seriously and would investigate. Target and Whole Foods did not respond to requests for comment. Fruit of the Loom said it had ended its contract with the supplier.
One company, Ben & Jerry's, said it worked with labor groups to ensure a minimum set of working conditions at its dairy suppliers. Cheryl Pinto, the company's head of values-led sourcing, said that if migrant children needed to work full time, it was preferable for them to have jobs at a well-monitored workplace.
The Labor Department is supposed to find and punish child labor violations, but inspectors in a dozen states said their understaffed offices could barely respond to complaints, much less open original investigations. When the department has responded to tips on migrant children, it has focused on the outside contractors and staffing agencies that usually employ them, not the corporations where they perform the work.
In Worthington, Minn., it had long been an open secret that migrant children released by H.H.S. were cleaning a slaughterhouse run by JBS, the world's largest meat processor. The town has received more unaccompanied migrant children per capita than almost anywhere in the country.
Outside the JBS pork plant last fall, The Times spoke with baby-faced workers who chased and teased one another as they came off their shifts in the morning. Many had scratched their assumed names off company badges to hide evidence that they were working under false identities. Some said they had suffered chemical burns from the corrosive cleaners they used.
Not long afterward, labor inspectors responding to a tip found 22 Spanish-speaking children working for the company hired to clean the JBS plant in Worthington, and dozens more in the same job at meat-processing plants around the United States.
But the Labor Department can generally only issue fines. The cleaning company paid a $ 1.5 million penalty, while JBS said it had been unaware that children were scouring the Worthington factory each night. JBS fired the cleaning contractor.
Many of the children who were working there have found new jobs at other plants, The Times found.
"I still have to pay back my debt, so I still have to work," said Mauricio Ramirez, 17, who has found a meat processing job in the next town over.
'Not What I Imagined'
It has been a little more than a year since Carolina left Guatemala, and she has started to make some friends. She and another girl who works at Hearthside have necklaces that fit together, each strung with half a heart. When she has time, she posts selfies online decorated with smiley faces and flowers.
Mostly, though, she keeps to herself. Her teachers do not know many details about her journey to the border. When the topic came up at school recently, Carolina began sobbing and would not say why.
After a week of 17-hour days, she sat at home one night with her aunt and considered her life in the United States. The long nights. The stress about money. "I didn't have expectations about what life would be like here," she said, "but it's not what I imagined."
She was holding a debit card given to her by a staffing agency, which paid her Hearthside salary this way so she did not have to cash checks. Carolina turned it over and over in her palm as her aunt looked on.
"I know you get sad," Ms. Ramirez said.
Carolina looked down. She wanted to continue going to school to learn English, but she woke up most mornings with a clenched stomach and kept staying home sick. Some of her ninth grade classmates had already dropped out. The 16-year-old boy she sat next to in math class, Cristian Lopez, had left school to work overtime at Hearthside.
Cristian lived a few minutes away, in a bare two-room apartment he shared with his uncle and 12-year-old sister, Jennifer.
His sister did not go to school either, and they had spent the day bickering in their room. Now night had fallen and they were eating Froot Loops for dinner. The heat was off, so they wore winter jackets. In an interview from Guatemala, their mother, Isabel Lopez, cried as she explained that she had tried to join her children in the United States last year but was turned back at the border.
Cristian had given his uncle some of the money he earned making Chewy bars, but his uncle believed it was not enough. He had said he would like Jennifer to start working at the factory as well, and offered to take her to apply himself.
Cristian said he had recently called the H.H.S. hotline. He hoped the government would send someone to check on him and his sister, but he had not heard back. He did not think he would call again.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Times was honored for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and a photo of war victims, as well as for its reporting on private schools for Hasidic Jews in New York.
The New York Times won three George Polk Awards, two for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and one for an investigation into Hasidic Jewish schools in New York that denied students a basic education.
On Monday, Long Island University, which has run the prestigious Polk Awards for journalism since 1949, announced winners in 15 categories chosen from 515 submissions. A special award went to the youngest ever recipient of a Polk.
"Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes," John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. "And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril."
The Times won the prize for foreign reporting. That submission included daily reporting on the war in Ukraine as well as a feature by Roger Cohen on President Vladimir V. Putin's "22-year slide from statesman to tyrant" in Russia. The Times's submission also included "Putin's War," a 13,000-word, two-month investigation that exposed Russia's powerful military as unprepared, ill-equipped and badly managed.
The Times also won the education reporting award for work by Eliza Shapiro and Brian M. Rosenthal that exposed how private schools in New York's Hasidic Jewish community were failing to provide students with an adequate education, despite receiving more than a quarter of a billion dollars in public funds annually.
Lynsey Addario of The Times won the photojournalism award for a photo that captured the horror in Ukraine. In the photo, the bodies of a Ukrainian mother, her two children and a family friend lay on the ground after they were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to flee Ukraine. The citation for the award noted that Ms. Addario "dove for cover as the shell landed and then took the gruesome photo on instinct."
The award for war reporting was given to Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant of The Associated Press. The A.P. was the last remaining Western news organization in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol after it came under fire from Russia, and the team of journalists documented the siege for almost three weeks before escaping.
The national reporting award went to Josh Gerstein, Alex Ward, Peter Canellos and the staff of Politico for their stunning scoop on a rare leak from the Supreme Court: a draft of the ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years. The official decision from the court came less than two months later. Politico continued its reporting with articles that examined the court's conservative majority and its hunt for the leaker of the draft.
John Archibald, Ashley Remkus and Ramsey Archibald of the news website AL.com won the prize for local reporting for an investigation into how the police force of the tiny town of Brookside, Ala., preyed on poorer residents with an aggressive increase in traffic citations and vehicle seizures, resulting in 640 percent growth in the town's revenues over two years.
The Reuters series "Undocumented and Underage," by Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke, which also focused on Alabama, won for state reporting. The Reuters team revealed the widespread use of migrant children for illegal labor at factories that supply auto parts to Hyundai and Kia, as well as at chicken plants.
The health reporting award went to Kendall Taggart, John Templon, Anthony Cormier and Jason Leopold of BuzzFeed News for their investigation into the dire conditions at a chain of group homes for people with disabilities after it was bought by KKR, a private equity firm.
Ian Allison and Tracy Wang from the online cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk won the financial reporting honor for their work in exposing problems in the relationship between Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX and his trading firm, Alameda Research. The article set in motion the rapid implosion of both firms, and days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. FTX customers and traders have lost billions of dollars, and Mr. Bankman-Fried is facing federal fraud charges.
A six-part series, "The Amazon, Undone," by Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, won the environmental reporting prize. It illuminated the ways in which Brazil has failed to protect the rainforest, pushing it to the brink of destruction.
The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of "911 call analysis," which claims to assess a caller's guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The foreign television award went to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, Kavitha Chekuru and Laila Al-Arian for "The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh," a segment on Al Jazeera English's Fault Lines program. The team examined the shooting death by the Israeli military of Ms. Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who was reporting in the West Bank.
Shimon Prokupecz, a senior crime and justice correspondent for CNN, and his crew were honored for national television reporting for their coverage of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, and of law enforcement's delay in challenging the gunman.
A special award was given to Theo Baker, a student at Stanford University and a reporter for The Stanford Daily, for uncovering allegations that some research papers co-written by Stanford University's president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, contained manipulated images. The university is now investigating the allegations. Mr. Baker, 18, is the son of two journalists -- Peter Baker of The New York Times and Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker, and is the youngest recipient of a Polk Award, according to Mr. Darnton.
The Sydney H. Schanberg prize, which honors long-form investigative journalism, was awarded to Alex Perry, a freelance journalist who chronicled a 2021 ISIS attack in a remote town in Mozambique for Outside magazine.

The Altruistic Beginnings of the FTX Debacle: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The FTX founder joined Jane Street Capital not to learn about controlling risk, which is its focus, but because the tenets of a philanthropic movement drew him there.
To close observers of Wall Street, the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried carried a curious twist: The man whose unbridled recklessness may have led to one of the largest financial frauds in history started his trading career -- and met many of his future lieutenants -- at an under-the-radar firm known for keeping a tight grip on its financial risk.
The collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that Mr. Bankman-Fried founded, has drawn attention to Jane Street Capital, a behemoth Wall Street firm that has few outside clients and mostly invests its own money. But when Mr. Bankman-Fried joined Jane Street fresh out of college in 2014, its reputation for risk management wasn't what attracted him.
Instead, he went there because of his interest in a philanthropic movement called effective altruism, which holds that taking a high-paying job is worthwhile if the end goal is to give much of the income away.
Mr. Bankman-Fried had heard about Jane Street through the effective altruists he already knew -- many of them young, with roots in the technology industry. Once he joined the firm, working out of its main office in downtown Manhattan, he built ties with more than half a dozen colleagues with similar views, who later became part of the FTX universe.
Among them was Caroline Ellison, a onetime romantic partner who later ran Alameda Research, a crypto trading firm that Mr. Bankman-Fried founded after leaving Jane Street.
"The sorts of people who are into effective altruism are not the sort of people who would flourish" in investment banking, William MacAskill, a British philosopher who is considered a leader of the movement, said in an April interview with The New York Times. "But Jane Street has this very nerdy, intellectual culture, so it's a better fit."
Mr. MacAskill was one of several people with connections to Mr. Bankman-Fried who spoke to The Times last year, before many distanced themselves in the wake of FTX's collapse.
Jane Street, which had become informally associated with the effective altruism movement, seemed like an obvious place to start. The firm projected an anti-Wall Street bent, where casual clothing was the norm well before the pandemic and playing puzzles was part of a trader's training. It recruited heavily from college campuses such as M.I.T., Carnegie Mellon and the University of California, Berkeley; paid junior employees handsomely; promoted a flat hierarchy; and saw little turnover.
A spokesman for Jane Street said that many people at the firm were involved in philanthropic giving, some donating to causes associated with effective altruism, but that Jane Street itself never had any connection to the movement. He declined to make anyone at the firm available for an interview.
The firm was founded in 2000 by Tim Reynolds, Rob Granieri and Michael Jenkins, all former traders at Susquehanna Investment Group, and Marc Gerstein, a former IBM developer. It was among the handful of trading firms that used its own, or "proprietary," assets to trade, rather than manage money on behalf of pension funds and other big investors.
Jane Street was among the firms that led the evolution of financial markets at the turn of the century, combining mathematical models -- or algorithmic programs -- with advances in technology to trade in milliseconds. Today, it is one of the most dominant global trading firms, with more than 2,000 employees.
It built its business around arbitrage, a trading strategy that exploits tiny price differences between very similar investments. That paid off during the pandemic, when it pocketed $ 8.5 billion in profit in 2020 amid the market volatility, according to documents viewed by The Times. The firm's profit in its founding year was $ 16 million.
Because Jane Street built its own technology, it often sought to hire recent graduates who could be trained to use its systems easily, like mathematicians or computer scientists. Job listings regularly stated that prior knowledge of finance or economics was not a prerequisite.
Given the speed and complexity of so-called quantitative trading, identifying and managing risk became a new challenge. The firm's focus on controlling risk -- which Mr. Jenkins once likened to a stint he spent working on a nuclear submarine -- became a core part of its identity. Through a spokesman, Mr. Jenkins declined to comment.
It's unlikely that Jane Street would have become one of the world's biggest trading firms "without having embedded outstanding risk management discipline, policies and systems into everything," said Paul Rowady, director of research at Alphacution Research Conservatory.
"Can't happen," he said.
Struggling to decide what he would do after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Bankman-Fried had lunch with Mr. MacAskill. He encouraged him to take a high-paying job and donate his income to charity.
In 2012, a Princeton graduate, Matt Wage, joined Jane Street and was later featured in a Times opinion column by Nicholas Kristof as an exemplar of the "earn to give" philosophy.
"He created a bit of the move for lots of people to work at Jane Street," Mr. MacAskill said of Mr. Wage.
Ms. Ellison, who would go on to run Alameda, the trading arm that Mr. Bankman-Fried founded before starting FTX, got a job at Jane Street after she graduated from Stanford in 2016. In a March interview, she said that early in her tenure at Jane Street, Mr. Bankman-Fried had reached out over email because they had mutual friends in the effective altruism community.
"I was kind of scared of him," Ms. Ellison said. "You could tell he was quite smart and sort of intimidating."
Mr. Bankman-Fried also met Brett Harrison at Jane Street, and recruited him to run FTX's U.S. operations in 2021. In an interview last week, Mr. Harrison said the two of them had bonded over their commitment to animal rights. Mr. Bankman-Fried, a vegan, would often eat French fries for lunch, Mr. Harrison recalled.
Mr. Bankman-Fried's younger brother and political adviser, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, who also identified with effective altruism, briefly worked for Jane Street after his brother left. Two other traders, Xiaoyun Zhang, who goes by Lily, and Duncan Rheingans-Yoo, got their start at Jane Street before leaving early last year to found Modulo Capital, a hedge fund backed by FTX. And Mr. Rheingans-Yoo's older brother, Ross, worked at Jane Street before taking a job last spring at FTX's charitable foundation, which was built on the principles of effective altruism.
If Jane Street was a meeting ground for young adherents of effective altruism, it wasn't the training ground for the risky and fraudulent activities that prosecutors say Mr. Bankman-Fried pursued at FTX.
Federal prosecutors contend that he orchestrated a scheme to loot customer deposits and misdirected billions of dollars in customer money to fuel trading at Alameda, make tens of millions in campaign donations, buy expensive Bahamas real estate and invest more than $ 4 billion in over 300 crypto companies and other ventures.
Mr. Bankman-Fried, who worked at Jane Street for three years, absorbed the firm's trading style, applying the same principles of arbitrage to crypto trading at Alameda that Jane Street used to profit on stocks and other assets.
But he doesn't appear to have taken the risk management lessons to heart.
"If there was anything related to risk or compliance, that went above him," said Mr. Harrison, the former head of FTX's U.S. business, who has since disavowed Mr. Bankman Fried. "Perhaps he had tasted just enough success at Jane Street to make him think he could do it all on his own, without appreciating the magnitude of the operation that was being successfully administered at Jane Street."
Mr. Harrison announced on Twitter in September that he planned to step down as head of FTX's regulated U.S. business and become more of an adviser to the company.
In January, Mr. Harrison said on Twitter that he was unaware of the alleged illegal activities at FTX but had become increasingly disenchanted with how the company was being run. Mr. Harrison is now running a new company, Architect, which will develop crypto trading software, and where his chief technology officer is also a Jane Street alum.
Soon after leaving Jane Street in 2017, Mr. Bankman-Fried started work on Alameda. That fast pivot upset some people at Jane Street, according to a person familiar with the situation, because Mr. Bankman-Fried was starting a rival trading firm and recruiting old colleagues.
Much like FTX, the relationships Mr. Bankman-Fried developed in those early years at Jane Street have imploded.
In December, Ms. Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, as did another former top executive at FTX. Modulo has become a focus for federal prosecutors as well as FTX's bankruptcy lawyers, who are seeking to recover the $ 400 million it received from Mr. Bankman-Fried.
Not long after the FTX collapse, Mr. Harrison, in a series of posts on Twitter, said that he had "fond memories" of Mr. Bankman-Fried at Jane Street but that when he went to work for him in the heat of FTX's expansion, the Sam he knew had gone.
"I realized he wasn't who I remembered," Mr. Harrison wrote.

It recruited heavily from college campuses such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and the University of California, Berkeley; paid junior employees handsomely; promoted a flat hierarchy; and saw little turnover.
A spokesperson for Jane Street said that many people at the firm were involved in philanthropic giving, some donating to causes associated with effective altruism, but that Jane Street itself never had any connection to the movement. He declined to make anyone at the firm available for an interview.
The firm was founded in 2000 by Tim Reynolds, Rob Granieri and Michael Jenkins, all former traders at Susquehanna Investment Group, and Marc Gerstein, a former IBM developer. It was among the handful of trading firms that used its own, or “proprietary,” assets to trade, rather than manage money on behalf of pension funds and other big investors.
Jane Street was among the firms that led the evolution of financial markets at the turn of the century, combining mathematical models — or algorithmic programs — with advances in technology to trade in milliseconds. Today, it is one of the most dominant global trading firms, with more than 2,000 employees.
It built its business around arbitrage, a trading strategy that exploits tiny price differences between very similar investments. That paid off during the pandemic, when it pocketed $8.5 billion in profit in 2020 amid the market volatility, according to documents viewed by the Times. The firm’s profit in its founding year was $16 million.
Because Jane Street built its own technology, it often sought to hire recent graduates who could be trained to use its systems easily, like mathematicians or computer scientists. Job listings regularly stated that prior knowledge of finance or economics was not a prerequisite.
Given the speed and complexity of so-called quantitative trading, identifying and managing risk became a new challenge. The firm’s focus on controlling risk — which Jenkins once likened to a stint he spent working on a nuclear submarine — became a core part of its identity. Through a spokesperson, Jenkins declined to comment.
It’s unlikely that Jane Street would have become one of the world’s biggest trading firms “without having embedded outstanding risk management discipline, policies and systems into everything,” said Paul Rowady, director of research at Alphacution Research Conservatory.
“Can’t happen,” he said.
Struggling to decide what he would do after graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried had lunch with MacAskill. He encouraged him to take a high-paying job and donate his income to charity.
In 2012, a Princeton graduate, Matt Wage, joined Jane Street and was later featured in a Times opinion column by Nicholas Kristof as an exemplar of the “earn to give” philosophy.
“He created a bit of the move for lots of people to work at Jane Street,” MacAskill said of Wage.
Ellison, who would go on to run Alameda, the trading arm that Bankman-Fried founded before starting FTX, got a job at Jane Street after she graduated from Stanford in 2016. In a March interview, she said that early in her tenure at Jane Street, Bankman-Fried had reached out over email because they had mutual friends in the effective altruism community.
“I was kind of scared of him,” Ellison said. “You could tell he was quite smart and sort of intimidating.”
Bankman-Fried also met Brett Harrison at Jane Street and recruited him to run FTX’s U.S. operations in 2021. In an interview last week, Harrison said the two of them had bonded over their commitment to animal rights. Bankman-Fried, a vegan, would often eat french fries for lunch, Harrison recalled.
Bankman-Fried’s younger brother and political adviser, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, who also identified with effective altruism, briefly worked for Jane Street after his brother left. Two other traders, Xiaoyun Zhang, who goes by Lily, and Duncan Rheingans-Yoo, got their start at Jane Street before leaving early last year to found Modulo Capital, a hedge fund backed by FTX. And Rheingans-Yoo’s older brother, Ross, worked at Jane Street before taking a job last spring at FTX’s charitable foundation, which was built on the principles of effective altruism.
If Jane Street was a meeting ground for young adherents of effective altruism, it wasn’t the training ground for the risky and fraudulent activities that prosecutors say Bankman-Fried pursued at FTX.
Federal prosecutors contend that he orchestrated a scheme to loot customer deposits and misdirected billions of dollars in customer money to fuel trading at Alameda, make tens of millions in campaign donations, buy expensive Bahamas real estate and invest more than $4 billion in over 300 crypto companies and other ventures.
Bankman-Fried, who worked at Jane Street for three years, absorbed the firm’s trading style, applying the same principles of arbitrage to crypto trading at Alameda that Jane Street used to profit on stocks and other assets.
But he doesn’t appear to have taken the risk management lessons to heart.
“If there was anything related to risk or compliance, that went above him,” said Harrison, the former head of FTX’s U.S. business, who has since disavowed Bankman Fried. “Perhaps he had tasted just enough success at Jane Street to make him think he could do it all on his own, without appreciating the magnitude of the operation that was being successfully administered at Jane Street.”
Harrison announced on Twitter in September that he planned to step down as head of FTX’s regulated U.S. business and become more of an adviser to the company.
In January, Harrison said on Twitter that he was unaware of the alleged illegal activities at FTX but had become increasingly disenchanted with how the company was being run. Harrison is now running a new company, Architect, which will develop crypto trading software, and where his chief technology officer is also a Jane Street alum.
Soon after leaving Jane Street in 2017, Bankman-Fried started work on Alameda. That fast pivot upset some people at Jane Street, according to a person familiar with the situation, because Bankman-Fried was starting a rival trading firm and recruiting old colleagues.
Much like FTX, the relationships Bankman-Fried developed in those early years at Jane Street have imploded.
In December, Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, as did another former top executive at FTX. Modulo has become a focus for federal prosecutors as well as FTX’s bankruptcy lawyers, who are seeking to recover the $400 million it received from Bankman-Fried.
Not long after the FTX collapse, Harrison, in a series of posts on Twitter, said that he had “fond memories” of Bankman-Fried at Jane Street but that when he went to work for him in the heat of FTX’s expansion, the Sam he knew had gone.
“I realized he wasn’t who I remembered,” Harrison wrote. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The New York Times won three George Polk Awards, two for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and one for an investigation into Hasidic Jewish schools in New York that denied students a basic education.
On Monday, Long Island University, which has run the prestigious Polk Awards for journalism since 1949, announced winners in 15 categories chosen from 515 submissions. A special award went to the youngest-ever recipient of a Polk.
“Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes,” John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. “And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril.”
The Times won the prize for foreign reporting. That submission included daily reporting on the war in Ukraine as well as a feature by Roger Cohen on President Vladimir Putin’s “22-year slide from statesman to tyrant” in Russia. The Times’ submission also included “Putin’s War,” a 13,000-word, two-month investigation that exposed Russia’s powerful military as unprepared, ill-equipped and badly managed.
The Times also won the education reporting award for work by Eliza Shapiro and Brian M. Rosenthal that exposed how private schools in New York’s Hasidic Jewish community were failing to provide students with an adequate education, despite receiving more than $250 million in public funds annually.
Lynsey Addario of The Times won the photojournalism award for a photo that captured the horror in Ukraine. In the photo, the bodies of a Ukrainian mother, her two children and a family friend lay on the ground after they were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to flee Ukraine. The citation for the award noted that Addario “dove for cover as the shell landed and then took the gruesome photo on instinct.”
The award for war reporting was given to Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant of The Associated Press. The AP was the last remaining Western news organization in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol after it came under fire from Russia, and the team of journalists documented the siege for almost three weeks before escaping.
The national reporting award went to Josh Gerstein, Alex Ward, Peter Canellos and the staff of Politico for their scoop on a rare leak from the Supreme Court: a draft of the ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years. The official decision from the court came less than two months later. Politico continued its reporting with articles that examined the court’s conservative majority and its hunt for the leaker of the draft.
John Archibald, Ashley Remkus and Ramsey Archibald of the news website AL.com won the prize for local reporting for an investigation into how the police force of the tiny town of Brookside, Alabama, preyed on poorer residents with an aggressive increase in traffic citations and vehicle seizures, resulting in 640% growth in the town’s revenues over two years.
The Reuters series “Undocumented and Underage,” by Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke, which also focused on Alabama, won for state reporting. The Reuters team revealed the widespread use of migrant children for illegal labor at factories that supply auto parts to Hyundai and Kia, as well as at chicken plants.
The health reporting award went to Kendall Taggart, John Templon, Anthony Cormier and Jason Leopold of BuzzFeed News for their investigation into the dire conditions at a chain of group homes for people with disabilities after it was bought by KKR, a private equity firm.
Ian Allison and Tracy Wang from the online cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk won the financial reporting honor for their work in exposing problems in the relationship between Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange FTX and his trading firm, Alameda Research. The article set in motion the rapid implosion of both firms, and days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. FTX customers and traders have lost billions of dollars, and Bankman-Fried is facing federal fraud charges.
A six-part series, “The Amazon, Undone,” by Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, won the environmental reporting prize. It illuminated the ways in which Brazil has failed to protect the rainforest, pushing it to the brink of destruction.
The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of “911 call analysis,” which claims to assess a caller’s guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The foreign television award went to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, Kavitha Chekuru and Laila Al-Arian for “The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh,” a segment on Al-Jazeera English’s Fault Lines program. The team examined the shooting death by the Israeli military of Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who was reporting in the West Bank.
Shimon Prokupecz, a senior crime and justice correspondent for CNN, and his crew were honored for national television reporting for their coverage of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, and of law enforcement’s delay in challenging the gunman.
A special award was given to Theo Baker, a student at Stanford University and a reporter for The Stanford Daily, for uncovering allegations that some research papers co-written by Stanford University’s president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, contained manipulated images. The university is now investigating the allegations. Baker, 18, is the son of two journalists — Peter Baker of The New York Times and Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker — and is the youngest recipient of a Polk Award, according to Darnton.
The Sydney H. Schanberg prize, which honors long-form investigative journalism, was awarded to Alex Perry, a freelance journalist who chronicled a 2021 Islamic State group attack in a remote town in Mozambique for Outside magazine. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Spending on Technology Is Steadfast: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite an uncertain outlook, corporations plan to continue investing in their digital projects -- a source of stability for the economy.
Johnson Controls traces its origin to the late 19th century in Wisconsin, where a clever teacher and inventor named Warren Johnson designed an early thermostat to turn the heat on or off in his classroom.
Today, Johnson Controls is an international corporation and, like companies in every industry, increasingly a technology business. The company's software and sensors monitor and manage heating and cooling equipment, fire alarms, security systems and thermostats -- to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
Despite forecasts of a recession, Johnson Controls is not trimming its digital projects, as it seeks to make essential technology for smart buildings. Last year, the company added 500 software engineers and other technical staff to its team of 2,500 software engineers. It plans to hire 350 more tech workers.
"We have to continue to invest," said Vijay Sankaran, chief technology officer of Johnson Controls. "You can't do what we're trying to do without technology."
In recent interviews and surveys, the same theme was struck again and again. The economic outlook is uncertain. Contingency plans are in place. Some initiatives are being trimmed back or slowed down. But business investment in technology remains remarkably resilient, and that trend appears likely to continue in 2023.
In a recent poll of corporate technology managers in the United States by the research firm IDC, 82 percent said they expected a recession this year. But 62 percent replied that technology spending at their companies would be the same or increase compared with 2022.
The managers who shape technology strategy and spending at companies across the country hold an important swing vote in today's economy. Their confidence could help stabilize the economy, even as consumers cut back and Silicon Valley companies trim their payrolls after a period of explosive growth fueled by the pandemic.
Technology plays a larger role in mainstream corporate operations and accounts for a larger share of business investment than in the last two recessions -- in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst and in the 2007-9 financial crisis.
The big difference is software. Business spending on software, including software developed by companies for their own use, more than doubled over the last decade, to $ 567 billion in 2022, according to an analysis of government data by James Bessen, an economist at the Technology & Policy Research Institute at the Boston University School of Law.
That is 37 percent more than businesses spent on factories and industrial equipment combined.
The role of technology, experts say, has also steadily evolved. It is less an electricity-style utility used to automate back-office tasks and more a key ingredient that contributes to a company's revenue and profits.
In recent years, new technologies like cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity software have become increasingly mainstream. Companies now see them as vital tools for conducting business.
"That's going to be a counterbalance for the economy that didn't exist in the last two downturns," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
At Elevance Health, a big insurer and health services provider, the ever-larger role of information technology is apparent. Eighty percent of the communication contacts with the more than 45 million people the company covers are now through its website, mobile app or online chatbot. Five years ago, about 30 percent were handled on its digital channels.
Elevance, which last year changed its name from Anthem, employs a technology work force that numbers in the tens of thousands, including software engineers, user experience designers, data scientists and A.I. experts.
They work on automating tasks like authorizations for medical procedures and claims adjudication. They are also building the software to deliver personalized recommendations for treatments and health advice to medical professionals and individuals.
That goal, said Rajeev Ronanki, a senior vice president of Elevance, is the company's strategic direction. And it can be achieved only by mining and analyzing the insurer's vast stores of billing and clinical data for insights -- a job for teams of skilled tech workers.
A rocky economy may mean the company has to fine-tune its spending plans, Mr. Ronanki said. "But we're laser-focused on investing in our core priorities, and that won't change much regardless of the economy," he said.
Big Tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta are laying off workers. But that is not true of the broader tech economy.
Most technology workers do not work at tech companies. And while employment in tech occupations did slip slightly last month, by half a percentage point, it was 7 percent higher than in January 2022. Nearly 6.5 million people work in tech jobs in America, 430,000 more than a year ago, according to an analysis of government statistics by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The unemployment rate in tech occupations is 1.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for all workers.
Even the tech giants, after making layoffs, will have significantly more employees than before the pandemic. Most other companies did not go on wild hiring sprees, but had added steadily to their tech work forces.
JPMorgan Chase, the big bank, has a technology staff of 55,000, up from about 50,000 before the pandemic. It has hired people with skills in cloud computing, data science, A.I. and cybersecurity, and the bank will continue to add people selectively, said Lori Beer, the bank's global chief information officer.
Global technology surveys point to the weakness in spending on hardware. After a pandemic surge, sales of personal computers and smartphones for remote work and to consumers have fallen sharply. Two major technology research firms, Gartner and IDC, have lowered their growth forecasts in recent months, citing a continued slump in personal computers, the turbulent economy and a strong dollar.
But business investment, especially in software, remains fairly strong. John-David Lovelock, Gartner's chief forecaster, said spending was growing in every industry he tracks and called that trend "recession-proof." His counterpart at IDC, Stephen Minton, said business investment in technology was not immune to a downturn but was "more resilient than it's ever been."
Sales of remote cloud computing and software may be slowing, but only from the stratospheric heights of the pandemic. Amazon reported this month that its highly profitable cloud business, Amazon Web Services, the industry leader, was generating revenue at an annual rate of more than $ 80 billion and had grown 20 percent in the fourth quarter. Microsoft, the second-largest cloud company, reported that sales of Azure, its flagship cloud product, had grown 31 percent.
The recent results for technology suppliers to business show a similar pattern. Suppliers focused on helping companies convert to digital operations and cloud computing are doing well, including Accenture, Oracle and ServiceNow. IBM announced job cuts but for businesses it is shedding; its cloud and A.I. sales are strong.
Salesforce, a maker of customer-management software, is cutting jobs and is a target of activist shareholders. But their argument is that Salesforce should reduce expenses to increase profits. The company's revenue grew 14 percent in the most recent quarter.
The relentless advance of software in nearly every industry makes tech spending less cyclical.
Take the car business. A modern automobile is becoming "a vehicle that is really defined by software," said Alan Wexler, a senior vice president for innovation and growth at General Motors.
A sizable portion of the $ 35 billion that G.M. plans to invest in electric and self-driving cars and trucks through 2025 will be spent on software. The code will not only animate the cars, but also transmit entertainment, office-style communications services and automated driving upgrades to vehicles, as they increasingly navigate on their own.
BrightDrop, a G.M. start-up that makes electric cargo vans, relies on software to plan routes, conserve energy and optimize package stacking in its electric delivery pallets. FedEx recently placed an order for 2,000 BrightDrop vans, and Walmart has reserved 5,000.
When G.M. last month announced record profits, the company also said it planned to trim expenses by $ 2 billion over the next two years. It is a prudent step in an uncertain economy, its executives said.
"But we're not slowing down with these software-led growth businesses," Mr. Wexler said.

"You can't do what we're trying to do without technology," said Vijay Sankaran, right, of Johnson Controls.

Departure Of Women In Big Tech Continues: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of the most prominent women in Silicon Valley, she was an early Google employee and a key member of the inner circle of the company's founders.
Susan Wojcicki, YouTube's chief executive and one of the most prominent women in Silicon Valley, said on Thursday that she was stepping down from her longtime role leading the internet's most popular video service.
Ms. Wojcicki's departure signifies an end to the early, pioneering days of YouTube and its parent company, Google, and adds to a lengthening list of women who have left senior roles at big Silicon Valley companies in recent years.
Google spent some of its early days headquartered in Ms. Wojcicki's garage. A personal friend of Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, she became one of the company's earliest employees and climbed its executive ranks over the past two decades. After Google acquired YouTube, Ms. Wojcicki, 54, helped turn the video platform into one of the world's largest social media companies.
"Today, after nearly 25 years here, I've decided to step back from my role as the head of YouTube and start a new chapter focused on my family, health and personal projects I'm passionate about," Ms. Wojcicki wrote in a letter to employees, which was published on YouTube's official blog.
Neal Mohan, the company's chief product officer, will take over as chief executive.
In a joint statement, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin said: "Susan has a unique place in Google history and has made the most incredible contribution to products used by people everywhere. We're so grateful for all she's done over the last 25 years."
Andrea Faville, a YouTube spokeswoman, declined to comment on Ms. Wojcicki's health. But in recent months, Ms. Wojcicki appeared to cut down on public appearances, such as missing a "Made on YouTube" event in September.
Ms. Wojcicki will remain as an adviser at Alphabet, Google's parent company. Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, asked that she counsel businesses across the company's portfolio at a time when artificial intelligence was poised to transform many of its products.
"Susan played a key role in Google's origin story, and over the years her leadership opened up entirely new chapters for the company," Mr. Pichai said in a statement. He added that there were "exciting opportunities" ahead for the platform.
Ms. Wojcicki's exit from YouTube's top job further thins the ranks of women running large tech companies. Sheryl Sandberg, who was chief operating officer at Meta, left her role last year. Meg Whitman, who led Hewlett-Packard and one of its successor companies; Ginni Rometty of IBM; and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo have also left senior roles in recent years. While Safra Catz remains chief executive of Oracle, a maker of business software, Jayshree Ullal runs Arista Networks and Lisa Su leads the chip maker AMD, the industry has lost a raft of women leaders who broke barriers, with few obvious female successors in sight.
"It's a changing of the guard," Laura Kray, a professor of leadership at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview. "The fact that these highly successful women leaders are being replaced by men is a disturbing trend."
Professor Kray, the faculty director of the Center for Equity, Gender and Leadership, added that women's careers in the tech industry tended to be shorter than men's, and the loss of powerful female leaders shrank the number of role models for younger women in tech.
Despite tech companies' emphasizing the need for more diverse leadership in recent years, the gender gap extends from large companies to small ones. More than half of American start-ups lacked women in leadership in 2020, according to a report from Silicon Valley Bank.
Diane Greene, the former chief executive of Google Cloud, said Ms. Wojcicki was synonymous with Google and helped build it into a juggernaut.
"She's been visionary, she's done phenomenal execution and she's been extraordinarily supportive of other women," Ms. Greene, now the chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview.
Ms. Greene, who co-founded and once led the software maker VMware, said she was optimistic that a new generation of women currently making their marks as scientists and academics will help lead the tech industry in the coming years.
Mr. Mohan came to Google from DoubleClick, an advertising technology company acquired by Google in 2007, and eventually rose to be a senior vice president of video and display ads. He became YouTube's chief product officer in 2015 and has overseen trust and safety efforts and the launches of major products, including YouTube Music and Shorts, Ms. Wojcicki wrote in her note on Thursday.
Mr. Mohan inherits YouTube during a challenging period. The company is contending with a slowdown in digital advertising that has halted its growth, and it faces increasing competition from TikTok, a Chinese-owned short video service.
YouTube added its own short-video feature, Shorts, to compete, and it has tried to become a destination for more premium content by offering cable television programs and the N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, a package of weekly football games. Mr. Pichai said this month that Shorts was now averaging 50 billion daily views. The service has also begun running ads and sharing revenue with creators on the platform, an effort to lure influencers away from TikTok.
YouTube has recently lost several prominent executives, including Robert Kyncl, who was chief business officer before leaving at the start of the year to become the chief executive of Warner Music Group, and Martin Kon, YouTube's business finance officer, who departed for the A.I. start-up Cohere.
"I have never in my career met a C.E.O. like Susan," Mr. Kon, who is now Cohere's president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. "She was able to go back and forth with engineers, with data scientists, with partnerships people, with marketing people on the details of what they're doing."
The bulk of YouTube's revenue comes from ads that run before, during and alongside videos. In the third quarter, the company's ad sales declined 1.9 percent from a year earlier. Last quarter, revenue dropped 8 percent, to $ 7.96 billion.
The platform has long been keen to diversify its business and has prioritized efforts to expand its content subscriptions. YouTube said in November that it had 80 million paid subscribers for its music and premium services, a jump of 30 million from the previous year.
The platform also offers YouTube TV, a bundle of streaming television channels to replace cable packages. YouTube TV has more than five million subscribers, the company has said. YouTube does not disclose the revenue it generates from subscriptions.

Susan Wojcicki, YouTube’s chief executive and one of the most prominent women in Silicon Valley, said Thursday that she was stepping down from her longtime role leading the internet’s most popular video service.
Wojcicki’s departure signifies an end to the early, pioneering days of YouTube and its parent company, Google, and adds to a lengthening list of women who have left senior roles at big Silicon Valley companies in recent years.
Google spent some of its early days headquartered in Wojcicki’s garage. A personal friend of Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, she became one of the company’s earliest employees and climbed its executive ranks over the past two decades. After Google acquired YouTube, Wojcicki, 54, helped turn the video platform into one of the world’s largest social media companies.
“Today, after nearly 25 years here, I’ve decided to step back from my role as the head of YouTube and start a new chapter focused on my family, health and personal projects I’m passionate about,” Wojcicki wrote in a letter to employees, which was published on YouTube’s official blog.
Neal Mohan, the company’s chief product officer, will take over as CEO.
In a joint statement, Page and Brin said, “Susan has a unique place in Google history and has made the most incredible contribution to products used by people everywhere. We’re so grateful for all she’s done over the last 25 years.”
Andrea Faville, a YouTube spokesperson, declined to comment on Wojcicki’s health. But in recent months, Wojcicki appeared to cut down on public appearances, such as missing a “Made on YouTube” event in September.
Wojcicki will remain as an adviser at Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, asked that she counseled businesses across the company’s portfolio at a time when artificial intelligence was poised to transform many of its products.
“Susan played a key role in Google’s origin story, and over the years her leadership opened up entirely new chapters for the company,” Pichai said in a statement. He added that there were “exciting opportunities” ahead for the platform.
Wojcicki’s exit from YouTube’s top job further thins the ranks of women running large tech companies. Sheryl Sandberg, who was chief operating officer at Meta, left her role last year. Meg Whitman, who led Hewlett-Packard and one of its successor companies; Ginni Rometty of IBM; and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo have also left senior roles in recent years. While Safra Catz remains chief executive of Oracle, a maker of business software, Jayshree Ullal runs Arista Networks and Lisa Su leads the chipmaker AMD, the industry has lost a raft of female leaders who broke barriers, with few obvious female successors in sight.
“It’s a changing of the guard,” Laura Kray, a professor of leadership at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview. “The fact that these highly successful women leaders are being replaced by men is a disturbing trend.”
Kray, the faculty director of the Center for Equity, Gender and Leadership, added that women’s careers in the tech industry tended to be shorter than men’s, and the loss of powerful female leaders shrank the number of role models for younger women in tech.
Despite tech companies emphasizing the need for more diverse leadership in recent years, the gender gap extends from large companies to small ones. More than half of U.S. startups lacked women in leadership in 2020, according to a report from Silicon Valley Bank.
Diane Greene, the former CEO of Google Cloud, said Wojcicki was synonymous with Google and helped build it into a juggernaut.
“She’s been visionary, she’s done phenomenal execution, and she’s been extraordinarily supportive of other women,” Greene, now the chair of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview.
Greene, who co-founded and once led the software maker VMware, said she was optimistic that a new generation of women currently making their marks as scientists and academics will help lead the tech industry in the coming years.
Mohan came to Google from DoubleClick, an advertising technology company acquired by Google in 2007, and eventually rose to be a senior vice president of video and display ads. He became YouTube’s chief product officer in 2015 and has overseen trust and safety efforts and the launches of major products including YouTube Music and Shorts, Wojcicki wrote in her note Thursday.
Mohan inherits YouTube during a challenging period. The company is contending with a slowdown in digital advertising that has halted its growth, and it faces increasing competition from TikTok, a Chinese-owned short video service.
YouTube added its own short-video feature, Shorts, to compete, and it has tried to become a destination for more premium content by offering cable television programs and the NFL Sunday Ticket, a package of weekly football games. Pichai said this month that Shorts was now averaging 50 billion daily views. The service has also begun running ads and sharing revenue with creators on the platform, an effort to lure influencers away from TikTok.
YouTube has recently lost several prominent executives, including Robert Kyncl, who was chief business officer before leaving at the start of the year to become the CEO of Warner Music Group, and Martin Kon, YouTube’s business finance officer who departed for the AI startup Cohere.
“I have never in my career met a CEO like Susan,” Kon, who is now Cohere’s president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. “She was able to go back and forth with engineers, with data scientists, with partnerships people, with marketing people on the details of what they’re doing.”

Walmart Is Closing
3 Technology Hubs in U.S.
Walmart will close technology hubs in Texas, California and Oregon, and aim to relocate employees from there to other locations, including the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.
"We've made the decision to focus our tech team's presence within select locations," Walmart said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. "We hope to relocate or allow for remote work for all affected associates."
Walmart had been expanding its tech hubs across the United States and Canada over the last few years. It also has hubs in India.
It was not immediately clear how many employees would be affected.
Walmart's digital business remains strong. In its most recent earnings, which it released in November, the retailer reported that e-commerce increased 1 percent from the previous year -- and 38 percent from 2020. The company will report fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday. JORDYN HOLMAN

Air India Agrees to Lease
A Record 470 Airliners
Air India unveiled deals on Tuesday for a record 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing, accelerating the rebirth of a national emblem under new owners Tata Group as Europe and the United States hailed deepening economic and political ties with New Delhi.
The provisional deals include 220 planes from Boeing and 250 from Airbus and eclipse previous records for a single airline as Air India vies with the domestic giant IndiGo to serve what will soon be the world's largest population.
President Biden called the agreement "historic."
Boeing will supply 190 737 MAX, 20 of its 787 Dreamliners and 10 mini-jumbo 777X.
Together with another 25 Airbus jets to be leased to meet immediate needs, the overall acquisition reaches 495 jets, an Airbus executive said.
The airline's renaissance under the Tata conglomerate aims to capitalize on India's growing base of fliers and large diaspora across the world. REUTERS
AUTOMOBILES
A TikTok Challenge
Snares Hyundai and Kia
Hyundai and Kia are rolling out software updates to stem a raft of auto thefts related to a TikTok challenge that authorities believe has led to at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities.
The updates are free for millions of vehicles that are missing a key anti-theft device, an issue that was exploited on social media and led to rampant theft of the cars.
The software being released updates the theft alarm software logic to extend the length of the alarm sound from 30 seconds to one minute and requires the key to be in the ignition switch to turn the vehicle on.
About 3.8 million Hyundais and 4.5 million Kias are eligible for the software update, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday.
Hyundai said updates began Tuesday for nearly 4 million vehicles beginning with a million model year 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue vehicles; remaining eligible vehicles will update by June. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Electric Vehicle Prices Are Closing In on Gas Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Competition, government incentives and falling raw material prices are making battery-powered cars more affordable sooner than expected.
More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point where they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap as or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of G.M.'s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $ 30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $ 3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $ 61,488, compared with $ 49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two best-selling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $ 43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $ 300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $ 55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $ 7,500 discounts on cars that start at $ 107,400.
Tesla "saw there is increasing competition and some of the competition is quite good," said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, "If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average."
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for electric car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $ 55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $ 80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers "are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits," said Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com, an online auto sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $ 9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
"If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit," said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new car prices are pushing down used electric vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17 percent since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used car market. That's largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and G.M. lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $ 6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $ 4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20 percent from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium's chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years.
"It's doable, and we're there," Ms. Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $ 7,500 tax credits will require electric car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partly shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company's Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as S.U.V.s rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $ 80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to the $ 55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $ 2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states, like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric vehicle sales soar -- rising 66 percent in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book -- automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, told investors this month.
General Motors and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at G.M., said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, G.M. will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer S.U.V. "That's how we get the economies of scale," Mr. Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company's chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. "It changed almost overnight," Mr. Babe said. "The floodgates opened."

At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and last week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and GM lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium’s chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years. “It’s doable, and we’re there,” Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply-chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $7,500 tax credits will require electric-car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partially shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to a $55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month.
GM and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say that they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at GM, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, GM will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer SUV. “That’s how we get the economies of scale,” Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company’s chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. “It changed almost overnight,” Babe said. “The floodgates opened.”

Full text: A Brooklyn institution dating to the Civil Rights era has an ambitious, new plan to close the racial wealth gap.
In 1966, Robert Kennedy, then the junior senator from New York, turned his attention to the country's racial frictions and the rupture of urban life, marked by rioting and despair. One freezing day in February, he went to Brooklyn to visit Bedford-Stuyvesant, where schools were falling apart, heroin was everywhere and fathers were not. Community leaders met him with hostility; they were tired of the political gaze, an interest in Bed-Stuy that seemed anthropological rather than practical or solution-oriented. Kennedy was annoyed-- telling aides later that he could have just as easily spent his time "smoking a cigar in Palm Beach." Still, he was deeply affected.
The result was the creation of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the first community-development organization in the country, one that pioneered public-private municipal partnerships, becoming a national model for hundreds of similar programs. During its first 10 years, Restoration (as it is universally known) spent $ 63 million in government, philanthropic and corporate funds to place thousands of local residents in jobs or training programs, build and rehabilitate housing, offer mortgages. It brought art and cultural programming to the area; it opened the Billie Holiday Theater and the first supermarket in a neighborhood with hundreds of thousands of people; and in 1968, it persuaded IBM to develop a computer cable plant that employed thousands of nearby residents.
More than a half-century later, Restoration faces a different set of challenges, the outcome of shifting demographics that have made Bed-Stuy one of the fastest gentrifying ZIP codes in the country. The changes have brought a new chapter of experimentation -- one that casts aside some of the mantras and ideologies sacrosanct in progressive circles, accepting the realities of a soaring real-estate market and aiming instead to come at the housing crisis from the labor side.
The truth is that even if manufacturing jobs were still abundant, they would be unlikely to provide salaries that would enable someone to live in a neighborhood where the median rent is $ 3,200; the cost of a studio apartment has increased 28 percent just since the onset of the pandemic, and brownstones are now selling for several million dollars.
Although the need for affordable housing is paramount in New York, it has tended to dominate the anti-poverty discourse even as high land and construction costs make progress excruciatingly elusive. Of the more than 5,900 apartments constructed in Bed-Stuy during the past decade, only 13 percent were targeted for low-income earners. To put it in the most reductive terms, the thinking within Restoration's brain trust was that it might simply be easier to make people rich.
On a recent Friday morning, I sat down with a group at the vanguard of Restoration's reinvention at the organization's headquarters on Fulton Street, completed in the early 1970s as a bleak fortress meant to convey safety over any sense of aspiration. The complex, known as Restoration Plaza, is on the verge of a massive 10-year renovation and expansion designed by the Ghanian-British architect Sir David Adjaye, a project that will enter the public-hearing stage at the city's department of planning next week. "I was moved by the history," Mr. Adjaye told me later when I asked what drew him to the venture, "the idea of making a civic heart; the original project was intended to do that and it succeeded in some ways and didn't succeed in others."
At the center of Restoration's reimagining is a technology training program that has already demonstrated promise. A few years ago, the organization partnered with the Marcy Lab School, a nonprofit developed as an alternative to college with the specific aim of training software engineers. (Despite a recent round of layoffs in the tech sector, software engineers are in high demand across a range of different industries.)
Marcy was founded by two young former teachers, Reuben Ogbonna and Maya Bhattacharjee-Marcantonio, both the children of immigrant families, who had observed that not every student they taught was suited for college. Raising money from corporate donors and philanthropies, they are providing free intensive education programs to fellows in a loft space overlooking the harbor, in Industry City in Brooklyn. The goal is to simulate a sense of community that students would get from a traditional college experience.
Two years ago, a cohort of fellows went through the 12-week program with sponsorship from Restoration that provided additional support to students in the form of financial and mental-health counseling as well as networking. Nineteen of the 20 fellows, all low-income students of color graduated into jobs with average starting salaries of $ 107,000, apart from benefits, bonuses and stock options. Admission to the program did not require the disclosure of grades or transcripts but rather a demonstrated passion for technology. The plan is to relocate the program to Restoration Plaza when it is completed. Lining the wall of a conference room in Industry City are portraits of graduates, one of whom, Ms. Bhattacharjee-Marcantonio told me, had already been promoted several times and has bought a Tesla; another had put a down payment on a multifamily house in Queens. They were in their 20s.
Yemisi Onayemi had been studying at New York City College of Technology, part of the city's public university system, when she eventually entered the Marcy program. She had gone on job interviews at places like Google and Tumblr, but the curriculum at her school was weak, she said, and she was competing with people from prestigious places like Carnegie Mellon and Georgia Tech. A report from the Center for an Urban Future that appeared late last year revealed that half of CUNY computer science graduates did not have a job in their field a year after graduation. Fewer than 21 percent of tech workers in the city are Black or Hispanic.
"Nothing was working out, and it led to a depression," Ms. Onayemi said, recounting her initial experiences on the job market. "I maxed out my credit cards and had to go back to restaurant work." She had been staying with a friend who said she had to leave. After the Marcy program, which she credits with building her confidence and ability to better manage the interview process, she got a job at JP Morgan with a $ 110,000 salary and a signing bonus. After she was hired, she rented an apartment in Bed-Stuy.
"It was Colvin who was really obsessed with this idea of wealth creation," Alan Fishman, an important investment partner and adviser at Restoration told me. Colvin Grannum ran Restoration for 20 years, and though he recently left the institution, he continues to play a critical role in its redevelopment. A native of Bed-Stuy who later graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Georgetown's law school, Mr. Grannum had in mind the kind of economic empowerment agenda that went beyond funneling people into jobs that gave them $ 50,000 a year -- survival without the prospect of success. There was an enormous difference, he believed, in a life spent getting by versus one anchored in the security of having several thousand dollars in savings for emergencies.
His successor, Blondel Pinnock, will have to shepherd Restoration's next phase through the various approval processes. The city has committed $ 50 million to the project, but much of the financing relies on filling ground floor retail space and drawing tenants to fill offices who will pay market rents and help mentor local talent. The development will have cultural space, social space, incubator space, pop-up space for local entrepreneurs. The hope is that by the time the project is finished, the reluctance of many workers to go to the office will have dissipated, and that young people living in Bushwick or Crown Heights or Bed-Stuy itself will be happy to go to work so close to where they live.
Still, change at this scale, particularly when it includes the construction of taller buildings, will inevitably draw opposition, even when, as in this instance, residents have been given the chance to talk about what they wanted. Over and over, it was clear that people hoped for good jobs and new opportunities, Ms. Pinnock said. "We're holding true to what the community wants."

Electric Vehicles Could Match Gasoline Cars on Price This Year

More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point at which they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Full text: GlobalFoundries will dedicate part of its semiconductor output to G.M. as the automaker offers more electric vehicles and driver-assistance systems.
General Motors has reached an agreement with a large computer chip maker to help ensure it has a steady supply of semiconductors as it ramps up production of electric vehicles and complex components that require increases in computing power.
Under the agreement, the chip maker, GlobalFoundries, agreed to set aside a portion of its manufacturing capacity exclusively to make chips for G.M.
The automaker plans to introduce more than two dozen electric vehicles around the world over the next two years. Large numbers of chips are used in internal-combustion vehicles as well.
General Motors is increasing the number of vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems that use cameras, radar and other sensors to allow hands-free driving under certain conditions.
Doug Parks, G.M.'s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, said in a statement that the company expected its need for computer chips to double over the next several years.
"The supply agreement with GlobalFoundries will help establish a strong, resilient supply of critical technology in the U.S. that will help G.M. meet this demand, while delivering new technology and features to our customers," he added.
The companies did not disclose the financial terms of their agreement.
G.M. has been working to reduce the varieties of chips it uses, and to cut the number of chips needed in each vehicle. The automaker hopes to develop single chips that can handle computation that is done by multiple chips today. Its long-term goal is to use only three classes of chips.
Several chip makers are building plants and expanding production in the United States with the help of funding from the CHIPS and Science Act, which President Biden signed into law last year.
Intel has announced plans to invest $ 20 billion to build two plants in Ohio, and Micron Technology says it will spend up to $ 100 billion on semiconductor manufacturing near Syracuse, N.Y. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expanding its operations in Phoenix, at a cost of some $ 40 billion.
Based in Malta, N.Y., north of Albany, GlobalFoundries operates chip factories formerly owned by IBM, and is hoping to secure funding to support its expansion plans. In November, its chief executive, Thomas Caulfield, said GlobalFoundries wanted to increase output at a plant near Malta and another in Burlington, Vt., and to build a new production area at an existing plant in Malta.
He said the company aimed to submit its proposal to Washington early this year.
Automakers have been struggling with a computer chip shortage for the last two years and at times have had to idle plants while waiting for new supplies. In 2021, Ford Motor reached an agreement with GlobalFoundries to collaborate on designing chips to help improve its supplies.
Analysts, however, say tight supplies will linger because automobiles use relatively simple chips and semiconductor manufacturers are investing more heavily in expanding production of advanced chips that generate more profit for them. It also takes about three years to build a new chip factory and bring it into production.
Automakers are likely to struggle to build sufficient inventories of chips if E.V. sales take off, according to a recent report by Bank of America Global Research. "Shortages persist in key areas," the bank said.

Bob Orben, One-Man Gag Factory And Speechwriter, Is Dead at 95: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He wrote tens of thousands of jokes in his career -- told by, among others, Dick Gregory, Jack Paar, Red Skelton and, for a while, President Gerald R. Ford.
Bob Orben, who after writing jokes for Dick Gregory, Jack Paar, Red Skelton and others in the 1960s found a new avenue for his wit when he became a speechwriter for President Gerald R. Ford in 1974, died on Feb. 2 in Alexandria, Va. He was 95.
His death, at a nursing home, was confirmed by his great-niece, Yvette Chevallier.
Mr. Orben was a one-man gag factory. He wrote joke books. He dispatched one-liners to entertainers, politicians and disc jockeys through his subscription newsletter, Current Comedy. And he wrote a column, My Favorite Jokes, for Parade magazine.
"I don't mean to blow my own horn," he told The Washington Post in 1982, "but between Johnny Carson's monologues, the political cartoonists such as Herblock and Oliphant, and me, if we all decide what the hot subject in the country is, that's what it is."
In 1968, Gerald Ford, a Michigan Republican who was then the House minority leader, needed someone to spice up a speech he was going to give to the Gridiron Club, an organization of journalists whose annual dinner was an opportunity to lampoon political figures. George Murphy, the former actor and United States senator, knew Red Skelton, for whom Mr. Orben was a writer, and recommended him.
Mr. Orben's goal was to make Ford funny, or at least funnier than Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, another speaker at the dinner. After listening to tapes of Ford's delivery, Mr. Orben came up with a few zingers.
"Ford was the surprise hit," Mr. Orben recalled in 2008 in an oral history interview with the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation. Among the Orben lines Ford delivered was the observation that he had no interest in the presidency, except that "on that long drive back to Alexandria, Virginia, where I live, as I go past 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I do seem to hear a little voice within me saying, 'If you lived here, you'd be home now."'
Mr. Orben continued to feed jokes to Ford during his vice presidency. When Ford became president in 1974, after President Richard M. Nixon resigned, he hired Mr. Orben.
A 1975 profile of President Ford in The New York Times Magazine quoted him reading aloud from a speech written by Mr. Orben that he was going to give to the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association. It included references to a prominent Democratic senator and an agriculture secretary known for his off-color remarks.
"I have only one thing to say about a program that calls for me to follow Bob Hope," he read. "Who arranged this? Scoop Jackson? It's ridiculous. Bob Hope has enormous stage presence, superb comedy writing and the finest writers in the business. I'm standing here in a rented tuxedo -- with three jokes from Earl Butz!"
Mr. Orben cautioned the president not to pause when delivering a good one-liner.
"Watch Hope," he told him. "You'll see he really punches through a line."
Mr. Orben fed Ford self-deprecating lines that suited his personality. One of those lines, also delivered in 1975, played off something Lyndon B. Johnson had famously said about him.
"It's a great pleasure -- and great honor -- to be at Yale Law's Sesquicentennial Convocation," he said. "And I defy anyone to say that and chew gum at the same time."
Mr. Orben became the director of the White House speechwriting staff in early 1976 and served through the end of the Ford administration.
John Mihalec, a speechwriter for President Ford during the 1976 presidential campaign, said it was not surprising that a comedy writer should excel at writing speeches.
"Comedy writing is so precise -- the setup and the punch line and everything has to be at exactly the right volume and in the right place," Mr. Mihalec said in a phone interview. "It's good training for the precision of presidential speechwriting."
Robert Orben was born on March 4, 1927, in the Bronx to Walter and Marie Orben. His father was in the hardware business. Bob was smitten by magic at an early age, and when he was 12 he and his brother, Walter, performed a mentalist act in the Catskill Mountains, "The Boy With the Radio Mind." It flopped.
After graduating from high school in 1943, he attended Drake Business School. He also started his short-lived career in magic.
He was hired as a magic demonstrator in a shop in Manhattan, but he found his métier not in performing magic but in writing about magicians; he was impressed by one magician's onstage comedic patter, which led him to publish a pamphlet, "The Encyclopedia of Patter," in 1946.
Over the next decade he would publish books like "Blue Ribbon Comedy," "The Working Comedian's Gag File," "Tag-Lines," "Bits, Boffs and Banter" and "The Emcee's Handbook." He published dozens of joke collections in his career.
He began writing his comedy newsletter in 1958, and in the 1960s he wrote for "The Jack Paar Program" and then for "The Red Skelton Hour."
After coming to the attention of the groundbreaking Black comedian Dick Gregory, Mr. Orben said, he sent him a page of jokes every day.
Another of his clients was someone very different from Mr. Gregory: Senator Barry Goldwater, the conservative Arizona Republican; Mr. Orben wrote for him during Mr. Goldwater's unsuccessful campaign for the presidency in 1964.
"One of the jokes that I wrote for Greg was talking about Goldwater," Mr. Orben said in the Ford Presidential Foundation interview. "And as you know, the campaign slogan was, 'In your heart, you know he's right.' And Greg used to say, 'In your heart, you know he's white.'"
Mr. Orben never returned to the White House. But he kept writing joke books, among them "2500 Jokes to Start 'Em Laughing" (1979), "2100 Laughs for All Occasions" (1983) and "2000 Surefire Jokes for Speakers" (1986).
He continued to write his newsletter through 1989, as well as writing speeches for business executives and working as a consultant to IBM.
Mr. Orben's wife, Jean (Connelly) Orben, died last year. He leaves no immediate survivors.
In 1974, Mr. Orben was helping Vice President Ford rehearse his speech for the Gridiron Club dinner. One line, about Ronald Reagan, who was then the governor of California, worried Ford: "Governor Reagan does not dye his hair. Let's just say he's turning prematurely orange."
He asked Mr. Orben, "Do you think the governor would take offense at that?"
"Now, I'm looking at this blockbuster joke of the year go up in smoke, but I think I gave him a fair, honest answer," Mr. Orben said in the 2008 oral history interview. "I said, 'You know, Mr. Vice President, Reagan has been in show business a good part of his life. He has gone through a thousand roasts, and I'm sure he has heard dyed-hair jokes. So I really don't think so."'
To Mr. Orben's relief, Vice President Ford delivered the line.

Tesla's Stainless Steel Pickup Truck Is Coming Soon. Maybe.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Already two years behind schedule, the Cybertruck has experts wondering how the company will manufacture its unusual stainless steel "exoskeleton."
More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla's share price, but also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Mr. Musk's hubris.
It would be very unlike Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup -- three of the best-selling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck's doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla's first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla's most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Mr. Musk's penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to "production hell" and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it's the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck's body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn't need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the "Back to the Future" films.
"Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech start-ups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions," Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. "To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk."
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel's tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
"Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don't have to learn from anyone else," said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, "and then they get stuck in a corner."
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Mr. Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn't begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle "will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line" in 2023, Mr. Musk said, "but it will be next year."
Tesla's delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or sport utility vehicles.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the best-selling vehicle, because it can't make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
G.M.'s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
"The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away," Mr. Rajkumar said. "It's a massive opportunity lost."
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Mr. Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Mr. Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Mr. Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
"Broadly the concept could make sense," said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. "This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good."
"But there are some open questions," Mr. Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck's body, which Tesla refers to as an "exoskeleton." Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $ 40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $ 100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are "certainly possible," said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. "I can understand why he wants to go there."

Orben continued to feed jokes to Ford during his vice presidency. When Ford became president in 1974, after President Richard Nixon resigned, he hired Orben.
A 1975 profile of Ford in The New York Times Magazine quoted him reading aloud from a speech written by Orben that he was going to give to the Radio and Television Correspondents’ Association. It included references to a prominent Democratic senator and an agriculture secretary known for his off-color remarks.
“I have only one thing to say about a program that calls for me to follow Bob Hope,” he read. “Who arranged this? Scoop Jackson? It’s ridiculous.

WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address a year ago, war had broken out in Europe just days before and it appeared inevitable that Vladimir Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America’s “pacing” challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.
On Tuesday night Biden faced a changed world.
Simultaneously managing an aggressive Russia and a risk-taking China may prove the greatest challenge of his next two years. And they will increasingly occupy his attention, especially now that Republican control of the House all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda.
So it was especially striking that in the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, he chose to spend relatively little time on America’s global role, focusing instead on his “Made in America” effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, even at the price of angering America’s closest allies and top trade partners.
History may well conclude that stitching the NATO alliance back together and unifying disparate Asian allies to face a combative Russia and an ascendant China was Biden’s most notable accomplishment, especially for a president who views himself first and foremost as a master of foreign policy.
But it made all the more vivid Biden’s choice to downplay those accomplishments, perhaps because he knows that America’s re-engagement in the world is both expensive and, at the opening of an election cycle, a tough political sell. Containing Russia and competing with China may be the work of decades, but it will add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to an already stressed budget.
Thanks to Western aid and Ukrainian resilience and ingenuity, the war now appears to have settled into a long, grinding conflict, one in which Washington and Moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict, arguably the tensest moment between the two superpowers since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. And the more success the Ukrainians have using American precision missiles, German-made tanks and NATO ammunition, the more likely it is that Putin will again threaten that, if necessary, he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he sees as an existential battle.
Since the summer, Biden’s intelligence agencies have been reassessing a China that appears far more willing to take risks — threatening Taiwan, defending disputed territory in the South China Sea and last week, sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental United States that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about its ambitions.
Now, Biden’s national security team is debating which China will be harder to handle: a confident, rising power or the one that, in recent months, seems to be stumbling, unable to manage the COVID-19 virus, and increasingly stressed as it tries to restore the spectacular economic growth that was the key to its power.
As the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the Chinese balloon and its mystery payload of high-tech sensors, even small incidents with Beijing can escalate rapidly. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his trip to China, the first by a State Department head in years. Republicans argued that Biden was “weak” for ordering the balloon shot down only after it has made its way across the country; Beijing accused him of a “clear overreaction” and said it reserved the right to retaliate. It was a reminder that in both countries, domestic political demands can force leaders to take a harder line, a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship.
These are the issues that dominate Biden’s days, as he descends into the Situation Room to measure progress in the Donbas region of Ukraine, or travels to groundbreaking ceremonies for new Intel or IBM semiconductor production plants, so that the United States is less dependent on Chinese production.
And yet Biden mentioned Ukraine only briefly Tuesday night — far less than he did last year. He invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her, but never referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president who visited Washington only two months ago to thank a joint session of Congress for American support.
Instead, he focused on his plans to spend $52 billion to jump-start chip production. “We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” he said.
To give America time to catch up, he has cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to China, and convinced Japan and the Netherlands to do the same.
“The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses,” Chris Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” said to the Marketplace radio program.
Biden mentioned President Xi Jinping by name, repeating his contention that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”
Biden also tried to make the case Tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country — to show that “democracy works” and can outpace autocracies — he has begun to show progress. “In the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker,’’ he said. “Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.”
It was part of his argument that while democracy is messy, once America gets its act together, it can prevail. “Before I came to office the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world,” he said. “Not anymore.” He then went further, ad-libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change places with Xi, given the scope of his recent problems.
That may have been a premature declaration of victory. Yet despite his domestic focus, Biden had much to brag about Tuesday when it came to leading an international response to Russia’s aggression. “Not since George H.W. Bush gathered the allies for the Persian Gulf War has a president pulled together this kind of alliance,” said Robert Litwak, the director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has written extensively about superpower competition, especially in the nuclear arena. “It has required a retooling of American foreign policy.”
After four decades toiling in foreign policy, Biden managed to get a reluctant Germany to cut off the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that made it dependent on Russian-produced energy and pulled it out of its post-World War II reluctance to rebuild significant military power. A few weeks ago it even agreed to send Leopard tanks to help the Ukrainians break through Russian trenches, a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time Biden addressed the joint session of Congress.
But as Bush learned the hard way, voters are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievements: He was defeated in 1992, only a year after his victory in the Middle East. Some of Biden’s advisers fear that history may repeat itself, noting that the cost of gas and eggs influences voters in ways that containing Russian and Chinese power do not.

Tesla’s Pickup Truck Is Coming Soon. Maybe.

More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla’s share price, but it also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Musk’s hubris.
It would be very unlike Musk, Tesla’s CEO, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup — three of the bestselling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck’s doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla’s first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla’s most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Musk’s penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to “production hell” and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it’s the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck’s body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn’t need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the “Back to the Future” films.
“Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech startups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions,” Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. “To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk.”
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel’s tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
“Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don’t have to learn from anyone else,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “and then they get stuck in a corner.”
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn’t begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle “will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line” in 2023, Musk said, “but it will be next year.”
Tesla’s delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or SUVs.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the bestselling vehicle, because it can’t make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
GM’s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
“The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away,” Rajkumar said. “It’s a massive opportunity lost.”
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
“Broadly the concept could make sense,” said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. “This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good.”
“But there are some open questions,” Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck’s body, which Tesla refers to as an “exoskeleton.” Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are “certainly possible,” said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. “I can understand why he wants to go there.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Mr. Biden is proud of reshaping foreign policy to focus on superpower conflict, but knows it is jobs and energy prices that voters want to hear about.

Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America's "pacing" challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.

WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address a year ago, war had broken out in Europe just days before and it appeared inevitable that Vladimir Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America’s “pacing” challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.
On Tuesday night Biden faced a changed world.
Simultaneously managing an aggressive Russia and a risk-taking China may prove the greatest challenge of his next two years. And they will increasingly occupy his attention, especially now that Republican control of the House all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda.
So it was especially striking that in the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, he chose to spend relatively little time on America’s global role, focusing instead on his “Made in America” effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, even at the price of angering America’s closest allies and top trade partners.
History may well conclude that stitching the NATO alliance back together and unifying disparate Asian allies to face a combative Russia and an ascendant China was Biden’s most notable accomplishment, especially for a president who views himself first and foremost as a master of foreign policy.
But it made all the more vivid Biden’s choice to downplay those accomplishments, perhaps because he knows that America’s re-engagement in the world is both expensive and, at the opening of an election cycle, a tough political sell. Containing Russia and competing with China may be the work of decades, but it will add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to an already stressed budget.
Thanks to Western aid and Ukrainian resilience and ingenuity, the war now appears to have settled into a long, grinding conflict, one in which Washington and Moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict, arguably the tensest moment between the two superpowers since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. And the more success the Ukrainians have using American precision missiles, German-made tanks and NATO ammunition, the more likely it is that Putin will again threaten that, if necessary, he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he sees as an existential battle.
Since the summer, Biden’s intelligence agencies have been reassessing a China that appears far more willing to take risks — threatening Taiwan, defending disputed territory in the South China Sea and last week, sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental United States that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about its ambitions.
Now, Biden’s national security team is debating which China will be harder to handle: a confident, rising power or the one that, in recent months, seems to be stumbling, unable to manage the COVID-19 virus, and increasingly stressed as it tries to restore the spectacular economic growth that was the key to its power.
As the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the Chinese balloon and its mystery payload of high-tech sensors, even small incidents with Beijing can escalate rapidly. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone his trip to China, the first by a State Department head in years. Republicans argued that Biden was “weak” for ordering the balloon shot down only after it has made its way across the country; Beijing accused him of a “clear overreaction” and said it reserved the right to retaliate. It was a reminder that in both countries, domestic political demands can force leaders to take a harder line, a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship.
These are the issues that dominate Biden’s days, as he descends into the Situation Room to measure progress in the Donbas region of Ukraine, or travels to groundbreaking ceremonies for new Intel or IBM semiconductor production plants, so that the United States is less dependent on Chinese production.
And yet Biden mentioned Ukraine only briefly Tuesday night — far less than he did last year. He invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her, but never referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president who visited Washington only two months ago to thank a joint session of Congress for American support.
Instead, he focused on his plans to spend $52 billion to jump-start chip production. “We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” he said.
To give America time to catch up, he has cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to China, and convinced Japan and the Netherlands to do the same.
“The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses,” Chris Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” said to the Marketplace radio program.
Biden mentioned President Xi Jinping by name, repeating his contention that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”
Biden also tried to make the case Tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country — to show that “democracy works” and can outpace autocracies — he has begun to show progress. “In the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker,’’ he said. “Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.”
It was part of his argument that while democracy is messy, once America gets its act together, it can prevail. “Before I came to office the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world,” he said. “Not anymore.” He then went further, ad-libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change places with Xi, given the scope of his recent problems.
That may have been a premature declaration of victory. Yet despite his domestic focus, Biden had much to brag about Tuesday when it came to leading an international response to Russia’s aggression. “Not since George H.W. Bush gathered the allies for the Persian Gulf War has a president pulled together this kind of alliance,” said Robert Litwak, the director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has written extensively about superpower competition, especially in the nuclear arena. “It has required a retooling of American foreign policy.”
After four decades toiling in foreign policy, Biden managed to get a reluctant Germany to cut off the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that made it dependent on Russian-produced energy and pulled it out of its post-World War II reluctance to rebuild significant military power. A few weeks ago it even agreed to send Leopard tanks to help the Ukrainians break through Russian trenches, a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time Biden addressed the joint session of Congress.
But as Bush learned the hard way, voters are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievements: He was defeated in 1992, only a year after his victory in the Middle East. Some of Biden’s advisers fear that history may repeat itself, noting that the cost of gas and eggs have a way of influencing voters that containing Russian and Chinese power do not.

More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla’s share price, but it also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Musk’s hubris.
It would be very unlike Musk, Tesla’s CEO, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup — three of the bestselling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck’s doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla’s first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla’s most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Musk’s penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to “production hell” and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it’s the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck’s body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn’t need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the “Back to the Future” films.
“Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech startups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions,” Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. “To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk.”
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel’s tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
“Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don’t have to learn from anyone else,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “and then they get stuck in a corner.”
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn’t begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle “will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line” in 2023, Musk said, “but it will be next year.”
Tesla’s delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or SUVs.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the bestselling vehicle, because it can’t make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
GM’s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
“The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away,” Rajkumar said. “It’s a massive opportunity lost.”
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
“Broadly the concept could make sense,” said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. “This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good.”
“But there are some open questions,” Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck’s body, which Tesla refers to as an “exoskeleton.” Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are “certainly possible,” said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. “I can understand why he wants to go there.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

New in Coding Class: Critiquing ChatGPT: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Marisa Shuman's computer science class at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx began as usual on a recent January morning.
Just after 11:30, energetic 11th and 12th graders bounded into the classroom, settled down at communal study tables and pulled out their laptops. Then they turned to the front of the room, eyeing a whiteboard where Ms. Shuman had posted a question on wearable technology, the topic of that day's class.
For the first time in her decade-long teaching career, Ms. Shuman had not written any of the lesson plan. She had generated the class material using ChatGPT, a new chatbot that relies on artificial intelligence to deliver written responses to questions in clear prose. Ms. Shuman was using the algorithm-generated lesson to examine the chatbot's potential usefulness and pitfalls with her students.
"I don't care if you learn anything about wearable technology today," Ms. Shuman said to her students. "We are evaluating ChatGPT. Your goal is to identify whether the lesson is effective or ineffective."
Across the United States, universities and school districts are scrambling to get a handle on new chatbots that can generate humanlike texts and images. But while many are rushing to ban ChatGPT to try to prevent its use as a cheating aid, teachers like Ms. Shuman are leveraging the innovations to spur more critical classroom thinking. They are encouraging their students to question the hype around rapidly evolving artificial intelligence tools and consider the technologies' potential side effects.
The aim, these educators say, is to train the next generation of technology creators and consumers in "critical computing." That is an analytical approach in which understanding how to critique computer algorithms is as important as -- or more important than -- knowing how to program computers.
New York City Public Schools, the nation's largest district, serving some 900,000 students, is training a cohort of computer science teachers to help their students identify A.I. biases and potential risks. Lessons include discussions on defective facial recognition algorithms that can be much more accurate in identifying white faces than darker-skinned faces.
In Illinois, Florida, New York and Virginia, some middle school science and humanities teachers are using an A.I. literacy curriculum developed by researchers at the Scheller Teacher Education Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One lesson asks students to consider the ethics of powerful A.I. systems, known as "generative adversarial networks," that can be used to produce fake media content, like realistic videos in which well-known politicians mouth phrases they never actually said.
With generative A.I. technologies proliferating, educators and researchers say understanding such computer algorithms is a crucial skill that students will need to navigate daily life and participate in civics and society.
"It's important for students to know about how A.I. works because their data is being scraped, their user activity is being used to train these tools," said Kate Moore, an education researcher at M.I.T. who helped create the A.I. lessons for schools. "Decisions are being made about young people using A.I., whether they know it or not."
To observe how some educators are encouraging their students to scrutinize A.I. technologies, I recently spent two days visiting classes at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx, a public middle and high school for girls that is at the forefront of this trend.
The hulking, beige-brick school specializes in math, science and technology. It serves nearly 550 students, most of them Latinx or Black.
It is by no means a typical public school. Teachers are encouraged to help their students become, as the school's website puts it, "innovative" young women with the skills to complete college and "influence public attitudes, policies and laws to create a more socially just society." The school also has an enviable four-year high school graduation rate of 98 percent, significantly higher than the average for New York City high schools.
One morning in January, about 30 ninth and 10th graders, many of them dressed in navy blue school sweatshirts and gray pants, loped into a class called Software Engineering 1. The hands-on course introduces students to coding, computer problem-solving and the social repercussions of tech innovations.
It is one of several computer science courses at the school that ask students to consider how popular computer algorithms -- often developed by tech company teams of mostly white and Asian men -- may have disparate impacts on groups like immigrants and low-income communities. That morning's topic: face-matching systems that may have difficulty recognizing darker-skinned faces, such as those of some of the students in the room and their families.
Standing in front of her class, Abby Hahn, the computing teacher, knew her students might be shocked by the subject. Faulty face-matching technology has helped lead to the false arrests of Black men.
So Ms. Hahn alerted her pupils that the class would be discussing sensitive topics like racism and sexism. Then she played a YouTube video, created in 2018 by Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist, showing how some popular facial analysis systems mistakenly identified iconic Black women as men.
As the class watched the video, some students gasped. Oprah Winfrey "appears to be male," Amazon's technology said with 76.5 percent confidence, according to the video. Other sections of the video said that Microsoft's system had mistaken Michelle Obama for "a young man wearing a black shirt," and that IBM's system had pegged Serena Williams as "male" with 89 percent confidence.
(Microsoft and Amazon later announced accuracy improvements to their systems, and IBM stopped selling such tools. Amazon said it was committed to continuously improving its facial analysis technology through customer feedback and collaboration with researchers, and Microsoft and IBM said they were committed to the responsible development of A.I.)
"I'm shocked at how colored women are seen as men, even though they look nothing like men," Nadia Zadine, a 14-year-old student, said. "Does Joe Biden know about this?"
The point of the A.I. bias lesson, Ms. Hahn said, was to show student programmers that computer algorithms can be faulty, just like cars and other products designed by humans, and to encourage them to challenge problematic technologies.
"You are the next generation," Ms. Hahn said to the young women as the class period ended. "When you are out in the world, are you going to let this happen?"
"No!" a chorus of students responded.
A few doors down the hall, in a colorful classroom strung with handmade paper snowflakes and origami cranes, Ms. Shuman was preparing to teach a more advanced programming course, Software Engineering 3, focused on creative computing like game design and art. Earlier that week, her student coders had discussed how new A.I.-powered systems like ChatGPT can analyze vast stores of information and then produce humanlike essays and images in response to short prompts.
As part of the lesson, the 11th and 12th graders read news articles about how ChatGPT could be both useful and error-prone. They also read social media posts about how the chatbot could be prompted to generate texts promoting hate and violence.
But the students could not try ChatGPT in class themselves. The school district has blocked it over concerns that it could be used for cheating. So the students asked Ms. Shuman to use the chatbot to create a lesson for the class as an experiment.
Ms. Shuman spent hours at home prompting the system to generate a lesson on wearable technology like smartwatches. In response to her specific requests, ChatGPT produced a remarkably detailed 30-minute lesson plan -- complete with a warm-up discussion, readings on wearable technology, in-class exercises and a wrap-up discussion.
As the class period began, Ms. Shuman asked the students to spend 20 minutes following the scripted lesson, as if it were a real class on wearable technology. Then they would analyze ChatGPT's effectiveness as a simulated teacher.
Huddled in small groups, students read aloud information the bot had generated on the conveniences, health benefits, brand names and market value of smartwatches and fitness trackers. There were groans as students read out ChatGPT's anodyne sentences -- "Examples of smart glasses include Google Glass Enterprise 2" -- that they said sounded like marketing copy or rave product reviews.
"It reminded me of fourth grade," Jayda Arias, 18, said. "It was very bland."
The class found the lesson stultifying compared with those by Ms. Shuman, a charismatic teacher who creates course materials for her specific students, asks them provocative questions and comes up with relevant, real-world examples on the fly.
"The only effective part of this lesson is that it's straightforward," Alexania Echevarria, 17, said of the ChatGPT material.
"ChatGPT seems to love wearable technology," noted Alia Goddess Burke, 17, another student. "It's biased!"
Ms. Shuman was offering a lesson that went beyond learning to identify A.I. bias. She was using ChatGPT to give her pupils a message that artificial intelligence was not inevitable and that the young women had the insights to challenge it.
"Should your teachers be using ChatGPT?" Ms. Shuman asked toward the end of the lesson.
The students' answer was a resounding "No!" At least for now.

NEW YORK — Marisa Shuman’s computer science class at the Young Women’s Leadership School of the Bronx in New York City began as usual on a recent January morning.
Just after 11:30, energetic 11th and 12th graders bounded into the classroom, settled down at communal study tables and pulled out their laptops. Then they turned to the front of the room, eyeing a whiteboard where Shuman had posted a question on wearable technology, the topic of that day’s class.
For the first time in her decadelong teaching career, Shuman had not written any of the lesson plan. She had generated the class material using ChatGPT, a new chatbot that relies on artificial intelligence to deliver written responses to questions in clear prose. Shuman was using the algorithm-generated lesson to examine the chatbot’s potential usefulness and pitfalls with her students.
“I don’t care if you learn anything about wearable technology today,” Shuman said to her students. “We are evaluating ChatGPT. Your goal is to identify whether the lesson is effective or ineffective.”
Across the United States, universities and school districts are scrambling to get a handle on new chatbots that can generate humanlike texts and images. But while many are rushing to ban ChatGPT to try to prevent its use as a cheating aid, teachers such as Shuman are leveraging the innovations to spur more critical classroom thinking. They are encouraging their students to question the hype around rapidly evolving AI tools and consider the technologies’ potential side effects.
The aim, these educators say, is to train the next generation of technology creators and consumers in “critical computing.” That is an analytical approach in which understanding how to critique computer algorithms is as important as — or more important than — knowing how to program computers.
New York City Public Schools, the nation’s largest district, serving about 900,000 students, is training a cohort of computer science teachers to help their students identify AI biases and potential risks. Lessons include discussions on defective facial recognition algorithms that can be much more accurate in identifying white faces than darker-skinned faces.
In Illinois, Florida, New York and Virginia, some middle school science and humanities teachers are using an AI literacy curriculum developed by researchers at the Scheller Teacher Education Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One lesson asks students to consider the ethics of powerful AI systems, known as “generative adversarial networks,” that can be used to produce fake media content, such as realistic videos in which well-known politicians mouth phrases they never actually said.
With generative AI technologies proliferating, educators and researchers say understanding such computer algorithms is a crucial skill that students will need to navigate daily life and participate in civics and society.
“It’s important for students to know about how AI works because their data is being scraped, their user activity is being used to train these tools,” said Kate Moore, an education researcher at MIT who helped create the AI lessons for schools. “Decisions are being made about young people using AI, whether they know it or not.”
To observe how some educators are encouraging their students to scrutinize AI technologies, I recently spent two days visiting classes at the Young Women’s Leadership School of the Bronx, a public middle and high school for girls that is at the forefront of this trend.
The hulking, beige-brick school specializes in math, science and technology. It serves nearly 550 students, most of them Latina or Black.
It is by no means a typical public school. Teachers are encouraged to help their students become, as the school’s website puts it, “innovative” young women with the skills to complete college and “influence public attitudes, policies and laws to create a more socially just society.” The school also has an enviable four-year high school graduation rate of 98%, significantly higher than the average for New York City high schools.
One morning in January, about 30 ninth and 10th graders, many of them dressed in navy-blue school sweatshirts and gray pants, loped into a class called Software Engineering 1. The hands-on course introduces students to coding, computer problem-solving and the social repercussions of tech innovations.
It is one of several computer science courses at the school that ask students to consider how popular computer algorithms — often developed by tech company teams of mostly white and Asian men — may have disparate impacts on groups such as immigrants and low-income communities. That morning’s topic: face-matching systems that may have difficulty recognizing darker-skinned faces, such as those of some of the students in the room and their families.
Standing in front of her class, teacher Abby Hahn knew her students might be shocked by the subject. Faulty face-matching technology has helped lead to the false arrests of Black men.
So, Hahn alerted her pupils that the class would be discussing sensitive topics such as racism and sexism. Then she played a YouTube video, created in 2018 by Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist, showing how some popular facial-analysis systems mistakenly identified iconic Black women as men.
As the class watched the video, some students gasped. Oprah Winfrey “appears to be male,” Amazon’s technology said with 76.5% confidence, according to the video. Other sections of the video said that Microsoft’s system had mistaken Michelle Obama for “a young man wearing a black shirt” and that IBM’s system had pegged Serena Williams as “male” with 89% confidence.
(Microsoft and Amazon later announced accuracy improvements to their systems, and IBM stopped selling such tools. Amazon said it was committed to continuously improving its facial-analysis technology through customer feedback and collaboration with researchers, and Microsoft and IBM said they were committed to the responsible development of AI.)
“I’m shocked at how colored women are seen as men, even though they look nothing like men,” said Nadia Zadine, a 14-year-old student. “Does Joe Biden know about this?”
The point of the AI-bias lesson, Hahn said, was to show student programmers that computer algorithms can be faulty, just like cars and other products designed by humans, and to encourage them to challenge problematic technologies.
“You are the next generation,” Hahn said to the young women as the class period ended. “When you are out in the world, are you going to let this happen?”
“No!” a chorus of students responded.
A few doors down the hall, in a colorful classroom strung with handmade paper snowflakes and origami cranes, Shuman was preparing to teach a more advanced programming course, Software Engineering 3, focused on creative computing such as game design and art. Earlier that week, her student coders had discussed how new AI-powered systems such as ChatGPT can analyze vast stores of information and then produce humanlike essays and images in response to short prompts.
As part of Shuman’s lesson, the 11th and 12th graders read news articles about how ChatGPT could be both useful and error-prone. They also read social media posts about how the chatbot could be prompted to generate texts promoting hate and violence.
But the students could not try ChatGPT in class themselves. The school district has blocked it over concerns that it could be used for cheating. So, the students asked Shuman to use the chatbot to create a lesson for the class as an experiment.
Shuman spent hours at home prompting the system to generate a lesson on wearable technology such as smartwatches. In response to her specific requests, ChatGPT produced a remarkably detailed 30-minute lesson plan — complete with a warmup discussion, readings on wearable technology, in-class exercises and a wrap-up discussion.
As the class period began, Shuman asked the students to spend 20 minutes following the scripted lesson, as if it were a real class on wearable technology. Then they would analyze ChatGPT’s effectiveness as a simulated teacher.
Huddled in small groups, students read aloud information the bot had generated on the conveniences, health benefits, brand names and market value of smartwatches and fitness trackers. There were groans as students read out ChatGPT’s anodyne sentences — “Examples of smart glasses include Google Glass Enterprise 2” — that they said sounded like marketing copy or rave product reviews.
“It reminded me of fourth grade,” said Jayda Arias, 18. “It was very bland.”
The class found the lesson stultifying compared with those by Shuman, a charismatic teacher who creates course materials for her specific students, asks them provocative questions and comes up with relevant, real-world examples on the fly.
“The only effective part of this lesson is that it’s straightforward,” Alexania Echevarria, 17, said of the ChatGPT material.
“ChatGPT seems to love wearable technology,” noted Alia Goddess Burke, 17, another student. “It’s biased!”
Shuman was offering a lesson that went beyond learning to identify AI bias. She was using ChatGPT to give her pupils a message that AI was not inevitable and that the young women had the insights to challenge it.
“Should your teachers be using ChatGPT?,” Shuman asked toward the end of the lesson.
The students’ answer was a resounding “No!” At least for now. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's financial performance was hurt by its stake in Rivian, an electric truck company, and an autonomous car business.
Ford Motor said on Thursday that it lost $ 2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.
The company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $ 7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $ 2.8 billion last year. Ford said on Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.
The automaker said its revenue had risen about 16 percent, to $ 158 billion, mainly because of higher car prices. The company sold 4.2 million vehicles worldwide, up from 3.9 million in 2021.
Ford has long struggled to reduce defects and recalls in its cars and trucks. Recalls can be expensive and time consuming, and company executives said on Thursday that they were working to improve the reliability of their vehicles.
"In simple terms, we need to improve quality and lower costs now," the company's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call.
Ford's performance was also hurt by a $ 600 million loss stemming from its joint ventures in China and about $ 12 billion in special expenses, including those related to Argo and Rivian, which has lost much of its value since it listed on the stock exchange in November 2021.
Excluding the special expenses, interest and taxes, Ford made a $ 10.4 billion profit last year, it said, roughly as much as in 2021.
"We should have done much better last year," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
In the last three months of the year, Ford had a $ 1.3 billion profit, a steep drop from a year earlier, when it booked a large gain from its stake in Rivian. Ford's revenue in the final three months of 2022 rose 17 percent, to $ 44 billion.
The company sold 1.15 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.1 million a year earlier but about 500,000 fewer than Ford had expected, Mr. Lawler said.
Ford's production has been slowed by the global shortage of computer chips, and Mr. Lawler said the company expected some disruptions to continue this year and a slight increase in production volume.
"In 2023, there is still going to be volatility on chips," he said. "On the older chips used in the auto industry, there is still capacity constraint."
Ford said it expected this year's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $ 9 billion and $ 11 billion.
Shares of Ford stock were down about 7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, Ford said that its sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2 percent in January and that its sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.
The automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, up from 142,445 in January 2022, when a shortage of computer chips slowed production and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of January, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier, a strong signal that supply chain problems were easing.
Models responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, the Bronco sport utility vehicle and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V.s, up 11 percent.
Ford halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitlán, just north of Mexico City, to increase output. Production will restart this month, the company said.
On Wednesday, Honda, Hyundai and Kia reported sales increases of 9 percent to 22 percent, also as a result of improved supplies of vehicles. But Toyota said its January sales fell 15 percent to 134,392 cars and trucks.

Robotaxis Aim to Expand, Despite Recurring Mishaps: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Waymo and Cruise hope to widen their projects to more of the city. But local officials are increasingly concerned about breakdowns causing congestion.
Last week, a self-driving car stopped in the middle of a busy street during the morning rush hour in San Francisco, jamming traffic for nearly two miles. The car, which was operated by Waymo, did not leave the intersection until company technicians arrived about 10 minutes later and manually drove it away.
With services in San Francisco and Phoenix, Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, is one of two companies operating so-called robotaxis without drivers behind the wheel. The other, Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, offers a service in San Francisco.
The services are the culmination of more than 10 years of research, development and testing by the two companies. After pouring billions of dollars into the technology, both say they will soon introduce driverless services in other cities, too. But because automated vehicles still struggle to drive themselves in certain situations, some local officials are questioning whether the services are ready for widespread use.
The day before the Waymo car snarled traffic, the City of San Francisco sent letters to the California state regulator asking that it slow the expansion of the services until officials gain a better understanding of the technology and its limitations. The letters were reported earlier by NBC News.
After operating limited services in San Francisco for several months, both companies have requested permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to charge money for driverless rides across the city and around the clock. But until the services are better understood, the city said, it does not want them operating in downtown San Francisco or during peak commuting times in the morning or evening.
"If the commission approves sweeping authorizations for both Waymo and Cruise, the hazards and network impacts caused by planned and unplanned A.V. stops that obstruct traffic could soon affect a large percentage of all San Francisco travelers," one of the letters said.
Both Cruise and Waymo said these letters were an expected part of their efforts to expand services in the city. "We have long appreciated a healthy dialogue with city officials and government agencies in California," said Katherine Barna, a Waymo spokeswoman.
The City of San Francisco declined to comment beyond what it said in its letters. "We welcome any suggestions on safety," said a Cruise spokesman, Aaron McLear.
The letters were the latest in back-and-forth talks among the companies, San Francisco officials and regulators.
Last year, Cruise began offering paid rides in driverless cars in certain parts of San Francisco between 10 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. And Waymo is now offering unpaid rides without drivers. But both companies still need regulatory approval before expanding commercial services without drivers across San Francisco. Waymo began offering paid rides in downtown Phoenix at the end of the year.
In August, Cruise asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the top federal regulator, to approve widespread tests of a new version of its self-driving car called Origin, which does not include a driver seat or a steering wheel. But San Francisco officials have expressed concern over this plan, too.
The plan, which could put as many as 5,000 of the new vehicles on the streets within two years, makes Cruise's past issues "far more consequential," the city said. If the company does not significantly improve performance of its technologies, it "could quickly exhaust emergency response resources and could undermine public confidence in all automated driving technology."
The autonomous cars can watch for pedestrians, change lanes and make right-hand turns. But they may struggle to deal with more complicated or unusual situations, like unprotected left-hand turns and broken traffic lights that engineers call "edge cases," because they do not happen as frequently as other scenarios.
"Sometimes these cars just need a human to help them out of a tough spot," said Phil Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in autonomous vehicles.
Waymo has operated a driverless service in suburban Arizona since the end of 2020. But that is very different from a congested city.
"If you get disabled on a quiet suburban street, you are not in anyone's way," said Matt Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. "If you're in the city, it's a big deal."
The Waymo car that blocked traffic in San Francisco last week entered a very complex and busy intersection "due to temporary road closures that precluded use of the intended route," Waymo said.
When a car cannot navigate a situation on its own, remote technicians can send the car additional information that can help it get going again. And if that does not work, the company must send a crew to retrieve the car.
At the end of June, Cruise caused a similar traffic jam in San Francisco. The company had trouble communicating with many of the cars in its fleet, and as they stalled in one area of the city, all lined up in a row, they clogged traffic until technicians arrived and got them moving again.
In September, five stalled Cruise vehicles blocked the path of city bus, delaying its 45 riders for at least 13 minutes. Its cars have also interfered with firefighting efforts in the city, according to the letter from San Francisco officials. One car obstructed a fire truck on its way to a fire. Firefighters shattered another car's window in an effort to prevent it from driving over their fire hoses.
Cruise cars have not caused life-threatening injuries or fatalities.
In the wake of such incidents, NHTSA, the federal regulator, recently opened an investigation into the company's cars. The agency is concerned that the vehicles "may strand vehicle passengers in unsafe locations, such as lanes of travel or intersections, and become an unexpected obstacle to other road users."
Cruise has repeatedly said it is working to prevent issues. But an independent review of the software systems that manage Cruise's fleet indicated that these software systems were not suited to the kind of widespread services that Cruise hopes to operate.
This review, which was completed last summer and was recently obtained by The New York Times, examined the systems that allow the company to communicate with its vehicles and provide remote assistance when the cars cannot solve problems on their own.
"Core fleet systems have significant stability, responsiveness and scaling challenges which now present fundamental problems for the company," the review said.
Conducted by consultants from IBM, the review said the systems, designed as a way of managing a small fleet of cars that included safety drivers, were not suited to a large fleet where the drivers had been removed.
"Further scaling with current platform will potentially compound existing issues," the review said. "Ability to simultaneously enhance the current platform while stabilizing it is in question."
A new system would require an additional $ 10 million to $ 20 million investment and most likely not be completed until the end of this year, according to the review. That is a relatively small expenditure considering the company spent more than $ 860 million on the development of its technology in the first half of last year.
Mr. McLear, the Cruise spokesman, said the company had fixed or addressed nearly every issue discussed in the review. "It is an outdated report," he said.
Even if Cruise redesigns and rebuilds its management software, there will be times when the company must send a crew to retrieve cars if they get stuck. The same is true of Waymo, a company spokeswoman, Julia Ilina, said. The companies must also send technicians when the cars break down in more traditional ways, such as a flat tire or a traffic accident.
Because of these limitations -- and the hundreds of millions of dollars the companies are pouring into research and development -- it is unclear how services will become viable businesses.
"The question is: Does this make sense economically?" said Dr. Koopman, of Carnegie Mellon. "They are taking the drivers out of the front of the car. But if they have just as many people in a building waiting for the cars to break, they haven't really solved anything."

SAN FRANCISCO — Last week, a self-driving car stopped in the middle of a busy street during the morning rush hour in San Francisco, jamming traffic for nearly 2 miles. The car, which was operated by Waymo, did not leave the intersection until company technicians arrived about 10 minutes later and manually drove it away.
With services in San Francisco and Phoenix, Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is one of two companies operating so-called robotaxis without drivers behind the wheel. The other, Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, offers a service in San Francisco.
The services are the culmination of more than 10 years of research, development and testing by the two companies. After pouring billions of dollars into the technology, both say they will soon introduce driverless services in other cities, too. But because automated vehicles still struggle to drive themselves in certain situations, some local officials are questioning whether the services are ready for widespread use.
The day before the Waymo car snarled traffic, the city of San Francisco sent letters to the California state regulator asking that it slow the expansion of the services until officials gain a better understanding of the technology and its limitations. The letters were reported earlier by NBC News.

G.M. Reports Strong Profits as It Moves to Challenge Tesla: [Correction]

Full text: Aiming to make a million electric vehicles a year by 2025, General Motors is investing in a Nevada lithium mine to help with battery production.
General Motors on Tuesday reported solid profits for 2022, after overcoming the computer chip shortages and softening demand that has slowed much of the auto industry last year.
The company reported $ 9.9 billion in net income, slightly below the total from the year before, while revenue rose 23 percent to $ 157 billion. It sold 3.6 million vehicles globally, up from 2.9 million in 2021.
"Our team rose to every challenge that was thrown at them in 2022," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a conference call.
In the fourth quarter, when rising interest rates began to slow sales of new cars and trucks, G.M. generated $ 2 billion in profit, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 28 percent to $ 43 billion. Vehicle sales increased 30 percent to 967,000.
G.M. shares rose more than 8 percent in trading on Tuesday, closing above $ 39.
The automaker forecast that profit in 2023 will be $ 8.7 billion to $ 10.1 billion. "We expect that our momentum will help us deliver strong results once again in 2023," Ms. Barra said.
She also said G.M. would seek to cut costs by about $ 2 billion and expected to reduce its work force through attrition. "We are not planning layoffs," she said.
In electric vehicles, G.M. has been gearing up to compete head-on with Tesla, the leader. G.M. said that it expected to produce about 400,000 electric vehicles from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and that it would be capable of annual E.V. production of more than one million in North America in 2025.
A new battery plant in Ohio began production in August, and a second battery plant is to open in Tennessee this year. The company has started selling some high-end electric vehicles using battery packs made in Ohio, and it expects its E.V. sales to increase this year as it adds more affordable models, like an electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and electric Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles.
All told, G.M. should have nine electric models available in the United States by the end of the year, Ms. Barra said.
To support its E.V. push, G.M. announced Tuesday, it is investing $ 650 million in a mining company, Lithium America, to develop a Nevada mine extracting lithium, a key battery ingredient. Production there is expected to start in 2026, Ms. Barra said.
But competition is getting keener. Automakers including Ford Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and Kia have also rushed new E.V.s to the U.S. market. And on Monday, Ford cut prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V., after Tesla cut its prices in mid-January by as much as 20 percent.
Garrett Nelson, an analyst with the financial research firm CFRA, said more than 100 E.V. models would be offered in the U.S. market by 2025. "We view the risk of market oversaturation as very high, and an industry pricing war should pressure margins," he said. "We remain skeptical that G.M. will achieve sales success with many of its new E.V. models."

Neighbors Help Moscow Sidestep West's Sanctions: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A surge in trade by Russia's neighbors and allies hints at one reason its economy remains so resilient after sweeping sanctions.
WASHINGTON -- A strange thing happened with smartphones in Armenia last summer.
Shipments from other parts of the world into the tiny former Soviet republic began to balloon to more than 10 times the value of phone imports in previous months. At the same time, Armenia recorded an explosion in its exports of smartphones to a beleaguered ally: Russia.
The trend, which was repeated for washing machines, computer chips and other products in a handful of other Asian countries last year, provides evidence of some of the new lifelines that are keeping the Russian economy afloat. Recent data show surges in trade for some of Russia's neighbors and allies, suggesting that countries like Turkey, China, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are stepping in to provide Russia with many of the products that Western countries have tried to cut off as punishment for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Those sanctions -- which include restrictions on Russia's largest banks along with limits on the sale of technology that its military could use -- are blocking access to a variety of products. Reports regularly filter out of Russia about consumers frustrated by high-priced or shoddy goods, ranging from milk and household appliances to computer software and medication, said Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in an event at the think tank this month.
Even so, Russian trade appears to have largely bounced back to where it was before the invasion of Ukraine last February. Analysts estimate that Russia's imports may have already recovered to prewar levels, or will soon do so, depending on their models.
In part, that could be because many nations have found Russia hard to quit. Recent research showed that fewer than 9 percent of companies based in the European Union and Group of 7 nations had divested one of their Russian subsidiaries. And maritime tracking firms have seen a surge in activity by shipping fleets that may be helping Russia to export its energy, apparently bypassing Western restrictions on those sales.
While Western countries have not banned the shipment of consumer products like cellphones and washing machines to Russia, other sweeping penalties were expected to clamp down on its economy. They include a cap on the price that Russia can charge for its oil as well as restricted access to semiconductors and other critical technology.
Some companies, including H&M, IBM, Volkswagen and Maersk, halted operations in Russia after the invasion, citing moral and logistical reasons. But the Russian economy has proved surprisingly resilient, raising questions about the efficacy of the West's sanctions. Countries have had difficulty reducing their reliance on Russia for energy and other basic commodities, and the Russian central bank has managed to prop up the value of the ruble and keep financial markets stable.
On Monday, the International Monetary Fund said it now expected the Russian economy to grow 0.3 percent this year, a sharp improvement from its previous estimate of a 2.3 percent contraction.
The I.M.F. also said it expected Russian crude oil export volume to stay relatively strong under the current price cap, and Russian trade to continue being redirected to countries that had not imposed sanctions.
Most container ships have stopped ferrying goods like phones, washing machines and car parts into the port of St. Petersburg. Instead, such products are being carried on trucks or trains from Belarus, China and Kazakhstan. Fesco, the Russian transport operator, has added new ships and new ports of call to a route with Turkey that transports Russian industrial goods and foreign appliances and electronics between Novorossiysk and Istanbul.
Sergey Aleksashenko, former deputy minister of finance of the Russian Federation, said at an event this month that 2023 would be "a difficult year" for the Russian economy, but that there would be "no catastrophe, no collapse."
Some parts of the Russian economy are struggling, he said, pointing to car factories that shut down after being unable to secure parts from Germany, France, Japan and South Korea. But military expenditures and higher energy prices helped prop it up last year.
"We may not say that Russian economy is in tatters, that it is destroyed, that Putin lacks funds to continue his war," Mr. Aleksashenko said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin. "No, it's not true."
Russia stopped publishing trade data after its invasion of Ukraine. But analysts and economists can still draw conclusions about its trade patterns by adding up the commerce that other countries report with Russia.
Matthew Klein, an economics writer and a co-author of "Trade Wars Are Class Wars," is one of the people drawing conclusions about this Russia-size hole in the global economy. According to his calculations, the value of global exports to Russia in November was just 15 percent below a monthly preinvasion average.
Global exports to Russia most likely fully recovered in December, though many countries have not yet issued their trade data for the month, he said.
"Most of that recovery has been driven overall by China and Turkey particularly," Mr. Klein said.
It's unclear how much of this trade violates sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe, but the patterns are "suspicious," he said. "It would be consistent with the idea that there are ways of trying to get around some of the sanctions."
Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington nonprofit, recently issued a similar analysis, estimating that the value of Russian imports from the rest of the world had exceeded prewar levels by September.
One of the case studies in that report was the jump in Armenian smartphone sales. Andrew S. David, the senior director of research and analysis at Silverado, said the trends reflected how supply chains had shifted to continue providing Russia with goods.
Samsung and Apple, previously major suppliers of Russian cellphones, pulled out of the Russian market after the invasion. Exports of popular Chinese phone brands, like Xiaomi, Realme and Honor, also initially dipped as companies struggled to understand and cope with new restrictions on sending technology or making international payments to Russia.
But after an "adjustment period," Chinese brands started to take off in Russia, Mr. David said. Overall Chinese exports to Russia reached a record high in December, helping to offset a steep drop in trade with Europe. Apple and Samsung phones also appeared to begin to find their way back to Russia, rerouted through friendly neighboring countries.
"Armenia is certainly not the only one," Mr. David said. "There's a lot coming through central western Asia, Turkey and the former Soviet republics."
Shipments to Russia of other products, like passenger vehicles, have also rebounded. And China has increased exports of semiconductors to Russia, though Russia's total chip imports remain below prewar levels.
One major open question is how effectively the Western price cap will hold down Russia's oil revenue this year.
The cap allows Russia to sell its oil globally using Western maritime insurance and financing as long as the price does not exceed $ 60 per barrel. That limit, which is essentially an exception to Group of 7 sanctions, is designed to keep oil flowing on global markets while limiting the Russian government's revenue from it.
Some analysts have suggested that Russia is finding ways around the effort by using ships that do not rely on Western insurance or financing.
Ami Daniel, the chief executive of Windward, a maritime data company, said he had seen hundreds of instances in which people from countries like the United Arab Emirates, India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia bought vessels to try to set up what appeared to be a non-Western trading framework for Russia.
"Basically, Russia has been gearing up toward being able to trade outside of the rule of law," he said.
Mr. Daniel said his firm had also seen a sharp uptick in shipping practices that appeared to be Russian efforts to contravene Western sanctions. They include transfers of Russian oil between ships far out at sea, in international waters that are not under the jurisdiction of any country's navy, and attempts by ships to mask their activities by turning off satellite trackers that log their location or transmitting fake coordinates.
Much of this activity had been taking place in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. But after media coverage of suspicious practices in this region, the hub moved south, off the coast of West Africa, Mr. Daniel said.
"They're exploding," he said of deceptive shipping practices. "It's happening at an industrial scale."
So far, the oil price cap appears to be accomplishing its goal of reducing the price that Russia can charge while keeping global supplies flowing. But it remains to be seen whether this shadow fleet of ships is big enough to allow Russia to buy and sell oil outside the cap, said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during a January panel discussion.
"If that fleet is big enough for Russia to really operate outside the reach" of the Group of 7 countries, the cap probably "won't have the kind of leverage that policymakers wanted," Mr. Cahill said. "I think we should know within a couple of months."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker reduced the price of the Mustang Mach-E by up to $ 5,900 after Tesla slashed prices of its cars by as much as 20 percent.
Ford Motor said on Monday that it was cutting prices on its top-selling battery-powered model, the Mustang Mach-E, and increasing production of the sport utility vehicle. It was the latest sign of intensifying competition in the electric car market.
Two weeks ago, Tesla slashed prices of its electric cars by as much as 20 percent in response to softening demand around the world.
The price cuts for the two most affordable versions of the Mach-E amounted to less than $ 1,000 each. Other models, with longer-range batteries and premium options, were reduced $ 3,680 to $ 5,900, reductions of 6 percent to 9 percent.
"We want to make E.V.s more accessible, so we're increasing production and reducing prices across the Mach-E lineup," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said on Twitter. He added that "with higher production, we're reducing costs, which allows us to share these savings with customers."
The lowest-priced Mustang Mach-E -- a rear-wheel-drive model with a standard battery -- now has a list price of $ 45,995, a reduction of $ 900. The high-performance Mach-E GT with an extended-range battery now sells for $ 63,995, a cut of $ 5,900.
Tesla's least expensive car is the Model 3, which is smaller than the Mustang Mach-E and starts at $ 43,990. The all-wheel-drive Model Y, a more direct competitor of the electric Mustang, starts at $ 53,490. An all-wheel-drive Mustang Mach-E with comparable battery range now lists for $ 53,995.
Electric vehicles priced below $ 55,000 can qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Ford's price cuts will make more versions of the Mach-E eligible for the credit.
Ford said the new prices would automatically apply to customers who had placed orders and were waiting for their cars. Ford's credit division is also offering subsidized interest rates as low as 5.34 percent on Mach E orders placed between Jan. 30 and April 3.
Tesla has long dominated the electric car market, which it largely had to itself until the last couple of years, but is increasingly encountering stiff competition. Its rate of growth has slowed in China, where its is now outsold by a local manufacturer, BYD. In addition to Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Kia and other automakers have introduced electric models in the United States that are selling well and are generally cheaper than Tesla's luxury models.
In 2022, Ford sold just under 40,000 Mach-Es, about 45 percent more than in 2021. That made the Mach-E the third-best-selling electric model after Tesla's Model Y and Model 3.
For much of the last two years, Tesla, Ford and other automakers raised prices of electric vehicles because demand for battery-powered cars far outstripped supply. But demand for cars and other big-ticket goods has weakened in recent months as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly. Fed policymakers are expected to slow their rate increases at their first meeting of the year on Wednesday.

The Week in Business: Creeping Layoffs: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech's challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector -- employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts -- but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn -- mass layoffs, for example -- there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent -- many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $ 420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire's). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk's actions led to the wild swings in Tesla's stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was "deliberately reckless" -- investors' words -- when he posted the tweet.
What's Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. "There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase," Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials' intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.
Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 -- though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed's attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country's largest tech companies, this week's quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver ... more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth -- the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $ 10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift's lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump's Instagram and Facebook accounts "in the coming weeks."

Make the Labor Market Work for More Americans: [Editorial]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/make-labor-market-work-more-americans/docview/2770379279/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In one of the richest nations on earth, the path to prosperity has narrowed significantly in recent decades -- especially for those without a college education. More than 62 percent of Americans ages 25 and up do not hold bachelor's degrees, and the earnings gap between those with a college education and those without one has never been wider. In 2021, the difference between the median earnings of younger workers with bachelor's degrees and workers of the same age with high-school diplomas only was $ 22,000 -- the largest since the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began tracking earnings in 1990. That's happening even as the cost of college spirals upward, putting it out of reach for many. This has fueled anxiety, bitterness and a sense of alienation among the millions who see themselves as shut out of an economy that does not value them.
Making college more affordable is important, but there are other keys to the doors of opportunity as well. With an executive order issued on Jan. 18, his first full day as governor, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania used one of them: He eliminated the requirement of a four-year college degree for the vast majority of jobs in the state government, a change similar to one that Maryland and Utah made last year. This demonstrates both good policy and good leadership, representing a concrete change in hiring philosophy that stops reducing people to a credential and conveys that everyone -- college-educated or not -- has experience and worth that employers should consider. It is a step -- and a mind-set -- that other leaders should consider as well.
The decision was driven in part by the realities of a tight labor market. Unemployment in Pennsylvania is 3.9 percent -- close to the national average of 3.5 percent -- and lower than it was before the pandemic. Public and private employers have been struggling to find qualified applicants, prompting a re-evaluation of hiring criteria. As Mr. Shapiro's order notes, "In the modern labor market, applicants gain knowledge, skills and abilities through a variety of means, including apprenticeships, on-the-job training, military training and trade schools."
His move opens up 92 percent of state government jobs -- approximately 65,000 positions -- to anyone with "the relevant work experience and skills-based training, regardless of their educational attainment." Job postings will emphasize experience over education.
The nonprofit organization Opportunity@Work has been promoting the idea of skills- and experience-based hiring since 2015. It estimates that 50 percent of the American work force comprises workers who have gained their skills through alternative routes such as apprenticeships, military service, trade schools, certificate programs and on-the-job training rather than acquiring bachelor's degrees -- a deep pool of underutilized and undercompensated talent. If employers don't have a strategy for engaging this pool, said Byron Auguste, the group's chief executive and co-founder, "they don't have a talent strategy -- they only have half a talent strategy."
If the United States can't find ways to tap into all of this talent, we will not be able to solve our most urgent problems, like climate change and pandemic preparedness, or build a stronger and fairer country. Too many Americans see our society and economy as profoundly unfair, set up to serve the needs of well-connected elites and providing more benefits to people who went to college or know how to work the system. And too many feel that political leaders don't care about them and that government and institutions don't work for them. Opening up jobs may seem small-bore, but it shows that government is listening and helps build trust among those who may feel unseen or looked down upon by parts of the labor market.
The private sector has been moving gradually in this direction already. Major players to embrace skill-based hiring include General Motors, Bank of America, Google, Apple and Accenture. IBM is recognized as a particular leader; about half of its U.S. job openings no longer require a four-year degree.
This trend has been concentrated among what is termed "middle-skill jobs," which call for some education or training beyond high school, according to a 2022 report by researchers from Harvard Business School and Emsi Burning Glass, a labor market data firm. These middle-skill jobs, the report notes, "have long served as an important steppingstone to the middle class."
During the Great Recession, many of those steppingstones were removed. Unemployment was high, and many employers responded with "degree inflation" -- larding college education requirements onto jobs that previously had not called for them -- even though the work involved remained the same. As a result, the report notes, "key avenues for upward mobility were closed to roughly 80 million prime working age Americans at a time when income inequality was already widening."
Over the last few years, this degree inflation has begun to recede. If this "degree reset" continues, an additional 1.4 million jobs would be opened to workers without college degrees over the next five years.
This could also help make the American work force more diverse and inclusive in several ways. Black and Hispanic job-seekers are less likely to have bachelor's degrees than non-Hispanic whites and Asian Americans. Rural Americans would also benefit; only 25 percent of them hold a bachelor's degree or higher. "No part of the country is more disadvantaged by degree screening than rural America," Mr. Auguste said.
The public sector should join this reset more aggressively. In June 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to make skills more important than degrees in federal hiring. The Biden administration has also taken a couple of steps in that direction.
Getting more states on board could provide a valuable boost; state governments are among the largest employers in many states, so their hiring criteria play a special role in validating workers without college degrees. Last March, Larry Hogan of Maryland became the first governor to announce that his state was doing away with college degree requirements for many jobs. In December, his fellow Republican, Spencer Cox of Utah, followed suit. "Degrees have become a blanketed barrier to entry in too many jobs," Mr. Cox said. "Instead of focusing on demonstrated competence, the focus too often has been on a piece of paper."
With Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, weighing in for Pennsylvania, the nation's fifth most populous state, the movement's bipartisan credentials have been burnished. It is a move that Americans in every state should actively encourage.
Expanding the terms for who can get hired is a change that would reverberate far beyond individual jobs and job seekers. It would bring a greater degree of openness and fairness into the labor market and send a message about government's ability to adapt and respond to the concerns of its citizens. In a country where a majority of people do not have bachelor's degrees, policies that automatically close off jobs to so many people contribute to the perception that the system is rigged against them.
A healthy democracy recognizes and promotes opportunity for everyone. Americans need to hear that message.

Despite Tesla's 'Incredibly Challenging Year,' Carmaker's Profit Rose 12% in Fourth Quarter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric car company is facing intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of Elon Musk.
Tesla reported a respectable jump in profit for the last quarter of 2022, but slipping profit margins and slowing sales growth underlined the challenges that have weighed on the carmaker's stock.
The profit increase of 12 percent capped a tumultuous year that included intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of its chief executive, Elon Musk. There is no sign from Tesla's report to shareholders on Wednesday that those problems are going away.
The year was dominated by Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which led to complaints by Tesla investors that he was neglecting his duties at the carmaker at a critical time.
Tesla shares fell 65 percent during 2022 as investors doubted whether the company was reacting energetically enough to a long list of challenges and risks.
Among other things, investors worried that Mr. Musk would sell more of his stake in Tesla to finance his Twitter acquisition, flooding the market. They worried about Tesla's prospects in China, the world's largest car market, because of problems maintaining the supply of critical parts and growing competition from rivals like the Chinese manufacturer BYD. During 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla in total electric cars sold in China.
At the same time, slowing economic growth and rising interest rates in the United States threatened to reduce the number of people who can afford a Tesla. Fourth-quarter deliveries rose 18 percent, to 405,000 vehicles, the company said on Jan. 2, a lot less than Wall Street analysts had expected and short of Tesla's own targets.
"It was our best year ever on every level," Mr. Musk said during a conference call with investors on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that "2022 was an incredibly challenging year."
Mr. Musk also addressed criticism that his statements on Twitter had alienated some potential buyers. His 127 million followers on the platform, he said, "suggests I'm reasonably popular."
While acknowledging that he might have offended some people, he maintained that his presence on the platform helps Tesla. "Twitter is actually an incredible tool for driving demand," he said.
Tesla shares recouped some of their losses in January after the company slashed prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe to revive sales. The price of a Model 3 sedan, the least expensive Tesla, dropped by $ 3,000, selling now for $ 44,000 in the United States before government incentives.
The markdowns appear to have prompted a surge in orders and helped reassure investors that Tesla had a plan to retain its dominance in electric cars. Tesla faces a stronger challenge from established car companies like Hyundai, Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen, which are selling more battery-powered vehicles and at lower prices than Tesla.
Although the price cuts helped to promote sales, they also took a toll on Tesla's profit margin. The gross profit margin on car sales slipped to 26 percent in the fourth quarter from 28 percent in the third quarter of 2022 and 31 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Tesla said on Wednesday it would begin production of its long-awaited Cybertruck by the end of the year, although it won't be able to ramp-up manufacturing of large numbers of the vehicle until 2024. Delays in the truck, which was unveiled in 2019, have allowed rivals like Rivian and Ford to beat Tesla to market with electric pickups.
"The fact the Cybertruck is on schedule is a big positive," Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note to clients.
Net profit for the quarter was $ 3.7 billion, up from $ 3.3 billion in the third quarter, Tesla said. For the full year, Tesla's profit more than doubled to $ 12.6 billion from $ 5.5 billion in 2021. Sales for the year, including revenue from solar panels, energy storage and other businesses, rose to $ 81.5 billion from $ 53.8 billion the previous year.
Tesla said it expected to produce 1.8 million cars in 2023, up from 1.4 million in 2022. That would be a more modest rate of growth than in 2022, when production increased by nearly 50 percent.
Tesla's shares have risen by one-third since the beginning of January, though the stock price is still more than 60 percent below the high it set in November 2021.
Tesla earnings were among the most closely watched numbers on Wall Street this week. It remains the world's most valuable car company by far and is growing much faster than more established automakers.

Tesla reported a respectable jump in profit for the last quarter of 2022, but slipping profit margins and slowing sales growth underlined the challenges that have weighed on the carmaker’s stock.
The profit increase of 12% capped a tumultuous year that included intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. There is no sign from Tesla’s report to shareholders Wednesday that those problems are going away.
The year was dominated by Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, which led to complaints by Tesla investors that he was neglecting his duties at the carmaker at a critical time.
Tesla shares fell 65% during 2022 as investors doubted whether the company was reacting energetically enough to a long list of challenges and risks.
Among other things, investors worried that Musk would sell more of his stake in Tesla to finance his Twitter acquisition, flooding the market. They worried about Tesla’s prospects in China, the world’s largest car market, because of problems maintaining the supply of critical parts and growing competition from rivals including Chinese manufacturer BYD. During 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla in total electric cars sold in China.
At the same time, slowing economic growth and rising interest rates in the United States threatened to reduce the number of people who can afford a Tesla. Fourth-quarter deliveries rose 18%, to 405,000 vehicles, the company said Jan. 2 — a lot less than Wall Street analysts had expected and short of Tesla’s own targets.
“It was our best year ever on every level,” Musk said during a conference call with investors on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that “2022 was an incredibly challenging year.”
Musk also addressed criticism that his statements on Twitter have alienated some potential buyers. His 127 million followers on the platform, he said, “suggests I’m reasonably popular.”
While acknowledging that he might have offended some people, he maintained that his presence on the platform helps Tesla. “Twitter is actually an incredible tool for driving demand,” he said.
Tesla shares recouped some of their losses in January after the company slashed prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe to revive sales.

K. Alex Müller, 95, Who Helped Make A Quantum Leap for Superconductors: [Biography]

Full text: His and a colleague's breakthroughs in high-temperature superconductors were honored with a Nobel Prize in Physics and opened up a world of scientific possibilities.
It's rare for a scientist to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics for discoveries made close to the age of 60, or for work done shortly before the prize is announced. But K. Alex Müller, a Swiss physicist, was 59 when he made his breakthrough, and he had to wait only 16 months before he received his Nobel Prize, in 1987, sharing it with a colleague for discovering that some ceramics can be superconductors, opening up a world of scientific and practical possibilities.
Dr. Müller died on Jan. 9 at 95, according to an announcement on Tuesday by IBM, where he had worked as a researcher. The University of Zurich, where Dr. Müller was once a professor and where he maintained an office after retirement, said he died in Zurich.
A superconductor is a material, generally black in color, that is able to convey electricity without resistance; a current running through it will never dissipate. Superconductors have another useful property: They create powerful magnetic fields.
Superconductivity was discovered accidentally in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, a Dutch physicist, who received the Nobel Prize in 1913 for cooling a series of gases down to the point that they become liquids. That temperature is usually near absolute zero, defined as minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 Kelvin.
Dr. Kamerlingh Onnes made his discovery about superconductivity while cooling mercury to minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit (about 4 Kelvin). He later found the superconducting temperature of tin (minus 453 degrees Fahrenheit) and lead (minus 447 degrees).
In the decades that followed, scientists made incremental progress at discovering materials that became superconductive at higher temperatures. But by the late 1970s, no one had found anything that did so at a temperature higher than minus 424 degrees Fahrenheit, which made the use of superconductors impractical.
In the early 1980s, Dr. Müller was working at IBM Research in Zurich -- a laboratory he had been associated with since 1963 -- when he became interested in finding high-temperature superconductors. To work with him, he recruited J. Georg Bednorz, whom he had advised on his Ph.D. work at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.
They began testing strontium titanate, an oxide that is classified as a ceramic because it is neither metal nor organic. Dr. Müller had studied the properties of strontium titanate for 15 years and thought that it could be modified to be a high-temperature superconductor. He turned out to be wrong, but he and Dr. Bednorz learned some valuable lessons and set about creating and testing other ceramics.
A quantum leap forward came in early 1986, when they created lanthanum barium copper oxide, a ceramic that became superconductive at about minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The publication of their results later that year ignited a frenzy in the scientific community as others raced to find ceramics that might be superconductive at even higher temperatures.
Hugo Keller, a physics professor at the University of Zurich, described Dr. Müller and Dr. Bednorz's research as a "breakthrough."
"Nobody expected to find superconductivity in such compounds," he said. "Even more surprising was their high critical temperature."
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the Nobels, promptly recognized the advance as well, bestowing the physics prize jointly on Dr. Muller and Dr. Bednorz in October 1987.
Within a couple of years of the discovery, scientists identified several other ceramics that worked well as high-temperature superconductors, including yttrium barium copper oxide (roughly minus 294 degrees Fahrenheit) and bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (roughly minus 267 degrees Fahrenheit). Those temperatures were significantly higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit), making them more practical to use as superconductors.
The real-world applications of these materials have been somewhat limited because ceramics can be brittle. But high-temperature superconductor cables were used to supply current to the magnets employed in both the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland and the Holbrook Superconductor Project on Long Island.
There is hope, however, that high-temperature superconductors could be used in the future to levitate trains over tracks, allowing them to move without mechanical resistance and at high speeds unheard-of today.
Karl Alex Müller was born in Basel, Switzerland, on April 20, 1927, the only child of Paul and Irma (Feigenbaum) Müller. Soon after Alex's birth, the family moved to Salzburg, Austria, where his father was studying music. A few years later, Alex's parents separated, and Alex and his mother moved to Dornach, Switzerland, near Basel, to live with his maternal grandparents. Alex and his mother then moved to Lugano, an Italian-speaking part of Switzerland.
His mother died when he was 11. He then spent the next seven years at Evangelical College, a boarding school in Schiers, in eastern Switzerland, only rarely seeing his father, who had remarried and had had another child. Alex's time at the school coincided with the outbreak and end of World War II.
After completing his obligatory military service in the Swiss Army, he enrolled as a student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The use of atomic weapons against Japan the previous year had stimulated widespread interest in nuclear physics, and his incoming freshman class was three times the usual size, beginning studies in what was known as the "atom bomb semester," Dr. Müller recalled in an autobiographical sketch for the Nobel committee.
At the institute, he studied under Wolfgang Pauli, an Austrian physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1945, and Paul Scherrer, a Swiss physicist who would later have a prestigious research and engineering institute named for him.
After working for a year in an institute department specializing in industrial research, Dr. Müller entered the doctoral program there and obtained his Ph.D. in 1957.
He worked for the Battelle Memorial Institute in Geneva from 1958 to 1963. He was then hired at IBM Research in Zurich. During this time he was also a lecturer and professor at the University of Zurich. He was named an IBM Fellow in 1982.
Dr. Müller married Ingeborg Marie Louise Winkler in 1956. His survivors include their son, Erich Müller; their daughter, Sylvia Straub-Müller; and three grandchildren.
Though the discovery of high-temperature superconductors was well received by the scientific community, the approach and the materials that Dr. Müller and Dr. Bednorz used were unorthodox, so much so that they decided to keep them a secret, even from their colleagues; they were afraid they'd be ridiculed.
As Dr. Bednorz explained in a 2015 interview with EP News, a CERN newsletter, "Thankfully, our colleagues working on semiconductors allowed us to use their equipment after they had left for the evening. Surprisingly, during the day, nobody noticed that many of the materials I worked with were sometimes black because they were conductors."

Hannes Keller, 88, a Swiss Explorer Who Plunged the Depths of the Sea: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His 1,020-foot descent to the Pacific Ocean floor in a diving bell in 1962 made headlines and set a record. But it had disastrous consequences.
Hannes Keller, a Swiss mathematician and inspired amateur explorer, planned his audacious deep ocean dive for more than a year. In December 1962, he intended to descend deeper than anyone before him: 1,000 feet down, off Santa Catalina Island, near Los Angeles, in a diving bell called the Atlantis.
"If a man could go, for instance, to 1,000 feet down and do practical work," Mr. Keller wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald, "then all the continental shelf zone could be explored, a total of more than 16 million square miles."
He and his expedition partner, Peter Small, a journalist and a veteran diver, knew that critical to the mission would be how well the gas they breathed mitigated the possibility of getting "the bends" -- the potentially deadly decompression sickness caused when bubbles of nitrogen form in divers' bodies during rapid ascents.
Mr. Keller enlisted the help of a cardiopulmonary specialist in Zurich and an IBM computer to conceive a secret formula of oxygen, nitrogen and helium, as well as a plan to dispense it at different mixtures at different depths.
The descent, on Dec. 3, 1962, went well -- "Anybody can go down," Mr. Keller told Life magazine in 1961 -- but when he exited the Atlantis on the floor of the Pacific Ocean to plant Swiss and American flags, his breathing hoses became entangled with them. He dropped the flags and returned to the vessel. But he started to feel dizzy and soon fell unconscious. So did Mr. Small.
When the mission's operations crew was pulling up the vessel, they saw the unconscious men on a television feed and sent two divers to investigate. One of them was able to shut the vessel's hatch after cutting away a piece of Mr. Keller's flipper, which had become stuck between the door and its frame, allowing pressure to build inside the bell. The other diver went missing. His body was never found.
Mr. Keller revived while still inside the bell. Mr. Small woke up, too, but he was weak, thirsty and sleepy, and Mr. Keller had to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mr. Small died of decompression sickness before he could be transported to a hospital.
"The gas mixture had gone bad," Ben Hellwarth wrote in "Sealab: America's Forgotten Quest to Live and Work on the Ocean Floor" (2012), adding that the disastrous dive "caused a sharp decline in interest in Keller's sensational methods."
Christopher Swann, a diving historian, said the dive "was a milepost in the sense that it was the first time something like that had been done."
"But it was a failure," he said in a phone interview, "because one person died with him and another person disappeared."
Mr. Keller was 88 when he died on Dec. 1 at a nursing home in Wallisellen, Switzerland, near his home in Niederglatt. His daughter Ethel Keller, who confirmed the death, said he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 twice and had several infections.
Hannes Keller was born on Sept. 20, 1934, in Winterthur, Switzerland. His father, Friedrich, was an architect. His mother, Emma (Schneider) Keller, was a homemaker.
Hannes took university courses in mathematics and physics but did not graduate. He later taught math at a college.
He began diving in Swiss lakes in 1958, an experience that gave him a vision for the future.
"It quickly dawned on him that unlike space exploration," Mr. Swann wrote in "The History of Oilfield Drilling: An Industrial Adventure" (2007), "diving was a field where an individual carrying out his own research could have a big impact, and that the way to do that was to break the world depth record."
In 1959, Mr. Keller dived to 400 feet in Lake Zurich in a rig made out of a 50-gallon oil drum. He then trained at various depths in the compression chambers of an elite French underwater research group and the experimental diving unit of the United States Navy.
In late June 1961, he and a Life magazine writer, Kenneth MacLeish, dived to a record depth of 728 feet in Lake Maggiore, in Switzerland, on an elaborately built platform that let Mr. Keller experiment with his mixture of gases. At a depth of 350 feet, Mr. MacLeish wrote, Mr. Keller switched to a different mixture of gases that he had devised for deeper water.
"There is barely enough 'air' to breathe, and it is bitter cold," Mr. MacLeish wrote, "even colder than the ice water in which we now hover. My teeth itch. I try to say OK but cannot manage it. Still, it appears that I can live on what we are getting."
Mr. Keller's success at Lake Maggiore brought him financial support from the Navy. Shell Oil, which was interested in how his research could benefit its offshore oil drilling, provided the support ship for the Catalina dive.
Despite the deaths on that dive, Mr. Keller and Dr. Albert Buhlmann, the cardiopulmonary specialist who had helped Mr. Keller create his gas mixture, signed a contract in 1964 with Shell International Petroleum to continue their research.
"Hannes Keller's prominence in the world of deep diving was relatively brief but definitely bold," Mr. Hellwarth said in an email. "His thousand-foot dive turned into a Houdini-like spectacle, unfortunately with disastrous consequences."
Mr. Keller moved on. In the late 1960s, he and a business partner, Hans Hess, developed a deep-sea diving suit and an aerodynamic ski-racing suit. He later started a line of computers, developed software programs and created an online art and photo museum.
In addition to his daughter Ethel, he is survived by another daughter, Leonie Keller; his sons, Fabian and Severin; and two grandchildren. His marriage to Tzuara Keller-Takahashi ended in divorce. His second wife, Esther (Frei) Keller, died in 2017.
The daring that Mr. Keller displayed in his diving could sometimes reshape itself into whimsy.
In 1968, Mr. Keller, a classical pianist who occasionally appeared in concert, staged a benefit performance at a concert hall in Zurich starring a man he introduced as the Russian pianist Antonei Tartarov. The pianist showed up onstage sporting a Beatles-like moptop and dressed in tails, a red tie, a red waistcoat and red socks. The program included what were said to be newly discovered works by Beethoven and Liszt.
Before the final number, Mr. Keller walked onstage to tell the audience that the performer was actually the Swiss pianist Jean-Jacques Hauser, who had improvised the "newly discovered" music.
"All except one Zurich critic were impressed by Mr. Hauser's virtuosity and enjoyed the joke," The New York Times wrote, adding, "Only one angry woman demanded her money back, and even she refused to take it when it was offered her, Mr. Keller said."

Tesla Cuts Its Prices Sharply As It Moves to Lift Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The price reductions in the United States will make more of the company's electric vehicles eligible for a federal tax credit.
Tesla has cut prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe by as much as 20 percent in a bid to spur slackening demand.
The automaker faces increasingly stiff competition in the global market for electric vehicles. It also must contend with rising interest rates in the United States, which have increased the cost of financing vehicle purchases.
"I think Tesla recognizes they are not the only game in town and the Detroit companies are jumping into the deep end with E.V.s," said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst. "I think the price cuts mean Tesla is going to rip the Band-Aid off and try to go on the offensive."
Tesla stock fell sharply in early trading Friday after the price cuts were reported, but ended the day less than 1 percent lower. The share price has fallen roughly 70 percent since November 2021.
The cuts will allow some of Tesla's lower-priced models, depending on optional features, to qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is available on electric cars priced under $ 55,000.
Tesla has enjoyed rapid growth for the last decade but now must contend with a variety of challenges, including concerns that its chief executive, Elon Musk, is too preoccupied with Twitter, the social media platform he acquired last year for $ 44 billion.
Mr. Musk has sold billions of dollars of Tesla stock to finance the Twitter acquisition, which has depressed Tesla's stock price, and he has come under fire for firing a large portion of Twitter's employees. He has also aired polarizing political views on the social media platform -- including several messages that appeared to support Russia in its war against Ukraine -- that have hurt his and Tesla's reputation with some consumers.
Tesla is not alone in dealing with slowing sales. U.S. auto sales fell about 8 percent last year to fewer than 14 million cars and trucks, the lowest level since 2011, mainly because shortages of computer chips prevented manufacturers from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In addition, rising borrowing rates made customer financing more expensive.
Sales of electric vehicles, however, rose 66 percent to more than 808,619, according to Kelley Blue Book, a market researcher. And while Tesla continues to dominate the segment, several automakers are gaining ground. Ford, Volkswagen and several other automakers posted sizable increases in E.V. sales last year and offer many models that were significantly more affordable than Tesla's. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia together sold more than 43,000 electric vehicles in the United States in 2022, up from a just few hundred in 2021.
New competitors are on the way, too. This year, General Motors is supposed to start making electric versions of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox sport utility vehicles.
Tesla has also had trouble in China, its largest market, where a local manufacturer, BYD, is now the No. 1 electric vehicle brand. Tesla recently lowered prices in China and reported a global sales total for 2022 that was below analysts' expectations.
While still hailed for the advanced technologies it packs into its cars, and their sleek styling, Tesla has been slow to add to its model line. It offers only four vehicles, and two are luxury models out of reach of most mainstream consumers. It last introduced a car in 2020, when the Model Y went into production.
Since 2019, Tesla has promised to introduce a pickup, called the Cybertruck, but has delayed its production several times. The company now hopes to begin making it this year. The Cybertruck has an angular, futuristic design and is expected to be sold as a luxury vehicle, which could limit its appeal. In the past, Mr. Musk has expressed a desire to produce an electric car that can sell for around $ 25,000, but he has laid out no formal plans.
In December, Tesla began delivering a small number of battery-powered semi trucks to PepsiCo, its first customer.
"We see demand problems remaining until Tesla is able to introduce a lower-priced offering in volume, which may only be in 2025," Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst, said in a report this month.
In cutting the prices of its current models, Tesla is indicating that it is willing to concede some profit in order to increase sales volume. The company typically shows gross profit margins of 26 percent -- more than double that of some rival automakers -- a factor that led investors to bid up its stock, making it the world's most valuable car company.
The latest price cut on Tesla vehicles appeared on the company's website late Thursday. The automaker now shows a high-end Model 3 Performance compact selling in the United States for just under $ 54,000, down from $ 63,000, a cut of 14 percent.
The most affordable version of the Model 3 now sells for just under $ 44,000, a reduction of about $ 3,000 or 6 percent. The Model Y now starts at $ 53,000, a cut of 20 percent from the previous price of $ 66,000.
The company's websites for Germany, France and other European nations showed similar price cuts. The base Model 3 is now listed at 44,000 euros, a reduction of about 12 percent from the previous price.
In the past, Tesla's sales were helped by $ 7,500 tax credits provided by an earlier federal program. Those credits were no longer available after Tesla sold 200,000 vehicles in the U.S. market, but the company's sales continued to grow rapidly. Tesla has forecast that its sales will grow about 50 percent a year for the next few years.
Tesla sold 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40 percent increase from the year before but short of the 50 percent target.
The company seemed to weather the computer chip shortage early in the pandemic better than most other automakers. Many had to idle plants temporarily at times because of shortages of certain electronic parts. Although Tesla, too, was affected, it said it was able to rewrite software that could run on substitute chips that were in more plentiful supply.
Tesla's fourth-quarter production of 440,000 cars was 34,000 more than the company delivered, suggesting that the sluggishness went beyond supply chain problems and production issues.

Full text: Messages and online posts from the Ph.D. student now charged with four murders show that he was once detached and suicidal before he became fascinated with criminals' minds.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- A criminology Ph.D. student charged with stabbing four University of Idaho students to death had written years ago of having suicidal thoughts, not being able to feel emotions and observing his own life as if it were a video game, saying he could do "whatever I want with little remorse."
The new revelations about the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, come from posts he made on an online forum in which he discussed his mental health struggles, as well as from interviews with those who knew him and messages he sent to friends that were obtained by The New York Times.
They paint a portrait of an anxious, isolated and depressed teenager who turned to heroin use before eventually getting clean and becoming fascinated with studying criminal psychology, saying then that he hoped to one day provide counseling for high-profile criminals.
"I feel like an organic sack of meat with no self worth," he wrote in 2011, when he was 16, adding later, in the same post: "As I hug my family, I look into their faces, I see nothing, it is like I am looking at a video game, but less."
Now, Mr. Kohberger, 28, is facing murder charges, accused of sneaking into a home shared by students just off the university campus in Moscow, Idaho, and stabbing four of them to death, in the middle of the night. At the time of the killings, Mr. Kohberger was in the first semester of his Ph.D. program at Washington State University, a 15-minute drive from the crime scene.
He has maintained his innocence through his lawyer, and on Thursday waived his right to a speedy preliminary hearing. A judge set a June date for the hearing, when prosecutors will outline evidence in an attempt to prove they have probable cause to try him on murder charges.
The police have disclosed some of the evidence that led them to arrest Mr. Kohberger at his parents' home in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, saying they had relied on DNA from a knife sheath left on a bed with two of the victims, cellphone records that suggest his phone had been in the area a dozen times before the murders occurred and surveillance footage of a white Hyundai, like the one Mr. Kohberger drove.
But the authorities have not outlined any motive for the killings, leaving families of the victims and acquaintances of the accused killer searching for answers.
"It's wild," said Jack Baylis, a Pennsylvania friend of Mr. Kohberger's who is among those trying to understand how Mr. Kohberger came to be charged with such a heinous killing. "Bryan himself would've been fascinated by it."
In online posts by Mr. Kohberger dating from when he was a teenager, he berates himself and talks about feeling disconnected from society, unable to find meaning in life. He describes an array of mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, depersonalization, lack of emotion and the "constant thought of suicide."
The words were posted on a forum website called Tapatalk, previously known as Yuku, where Mr. Kohberger commiserated with other users while suffering from a little-understood neurological condition called visual snow, in which a person's vision is obscured by scattering dots, much like the static seen on an analog television.
Mr. Kohberger did not use his name on the website, but the posts included a reference to his birthday. In addition, the username on the account, "Exarr," matches an email address for Bryan Kohberger that appeared in a 2009 leak of accounts from an online payment company; that account listed his location as Effort, Pa., the place where Mr. Kohberger grew up. Some of the posts also contained details that friends said matched their recollections of his behavior and struggles at the time.
Friends have previously described Mr. Kohberger as having an intellectual bent, but said that he occasionally turned cruel and angry. At Washington State, his peers said he rankled some people with a habit of overexplaining, and sounded particularly condescending when he spoke to his female classmates.
The online posts from his teenage years provide a deeper insight into what appeared to be a dark period of his life. On the forum website, Mr. Kohberger wrote that he saw a "sickly, tired, useless and stupid man" when he looked at himself in the mirror, and felt that he did not deserve to live. He also lamented treating his father "like dirt" though he considered him a good man.
"Nothing I do is enjoyable," Mr. Kohberger wrote. "I am blank, I have no opinion, I have no emotion, I have nothing. Can you relate?"
Mr. Kohberger said that his absence of emotion had begun about the same time as his visual snow symptoms, in September 2009, and one friend recalled him constantly talking about his fuzzy vision.
"I know it was something that really bugged him," said Thomas Arntz, who was friends with Mr. Kohberger during high school, until they had a falling out. "He was basically to the point where he was neurotic about it."
Dr. Francesca Puledda, a neurologist and researcher at King's College London who specializes in visual snow, said it is so little understood that there is debate among scientists over whether to call it a disease. But Dr. Puledda has worked with people who find the condition to be debilitating.
"We still don't know what causes it," she said. "We simply have to do more research."
Dr. Puledda said that the presence of visual snow is not a sign of mental illness, but noted that one research team found that people who have the syndrome also report a high incidence of psychiatric issues, such as anxiety, depression and depersonalization.
Mr. Kohberger wrote that he had tried anti-migraine medication, visited a neurologist and gone on a strict diet -- one that avoided sugar and starch -- to try to resolve the vision problem.
"He wouldn't eat any bread and he would only eat certain fruits," Mr. Arntz recalled. "It was very restrictive."
By 2012, it appeared that Mr. Kohberger was learning to live with the problem. Sounding more optimistic, he wrote on the forum that he had accepted his ailment and was coming to terms with it.
He graduated from high school in 2013 but had also begun to use heroin around that time, friends said.
Rich Pasqua, who graduated from high school a few years ahead of Mr. Kohberger, said they used heroin together in 2013 and 2014, at a time when they both worked at a pizza shop called New York Pizza Girl, in Effort, Pa.
Mr. Pasqua, now 31, recalled that Mr. Kohberger was socially awkward and did not appear to have many friends, frequently calling him and offering to share his marijuana. Mr. Pasqua, who said he is now sober and working at a rehabilitation center, recalled in one instance driving with Mr. Kohberger through the gated community where Mr. Kohberger's parents lived, trying to evade a private security guard.
"We would make it to a cul-de-sac and we'd see their orange lights and Bryan would be like, 'Go this way!"' Mr. Pasqua recalled. "He was like, 'We're going to get in so much trouble."'
Mr. Pasqua said his wife, who was in Mr. Kohberger's year, remembered that Mr. Kohberger had been heavier when he was in high school and was bullied over his weight. (Mr. Kohberger wrote in the online forum in 2011 of having lost half his body weight.) And Mr. Pasqua recalled teasing him on one occasion as well, telling Mr. Kohberger to walk to the private community's gates in the snow to get some heroin from him, only to not be there when he showed up.
Eventually, Mr. Pasqua said, Mr. Kohberger's father would pick up the phone when he called, once saying that his son was "on a top-secret mission," which Mr. Pasqua realized meant he was in rehab.
Years later, Mr. Kohberger appeared to be doing much better, studying psychology at DeSales University in Eastern Pennsylvania and telling one friend that his drug problems were in the past.
"I only used when I was in a deep suicidal state," Mr. Kohberger wrote in May 2018 to Mr. Baylis, with whom he had been friends since eighth grade. "I have since really learned a lot. Not a person alive could convince me to use it." Mr. Kohberger followed up later that day, telling Mr. Baylis that he had been off drugs for two years and telling him to not mention his drug use again, according to screenshots of their conversation on Facebook Messenger.
He told Mr. Baylis at one point that he thought he had been depressed since he was 5 years old, for so long that he had "developed a weird sense of meaning."
In one message from October 2018, Mr. Kohberger wrote that he was interested in studying criminals. He said he would like to be involved in capturing violent criminals but that it could be difficult to get a job like that.
"I'm thinking more along the lines of dealing with high-profile offenders," he wrote. "Counseling."
Among the details that emerged in a police affidavit last week was that Mr. Kohberger had, last fall, applied for an internship with the Police Department in Pullman, Wash., where he was living while studying at Washington State. Officials have declined to say whether or not he got the internship.
The University of Idaho victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- were killed after spending a typical Saturday night around town, with two of them going to a party and two others going to a bar before returning home in the early morning hours. Investigators believe all four were killed shortly after 4 a.m.
Two more roommates were at home at the time of the attack but were not hurt. One told the police that she had heard crying and voices around 4 a.m., and had opened her bedroom door to see a man -- wearing black clothing and a mask -- walking by her toward the home's back door, according to a police affidavit. The roommate locked herself in her room, and it is unclear what she did after that, but no one in the apartment called 911 until just before noon.
Shanon Gray, a lawyer for the family of Ms. Goncalves, said family members have been searching for information that might show a connection between the victims and Mr. Kohberger, but that no link has emerged so far.
"They didn't know him," he said.

Korean Solar Company Plans Georgia Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Hanwha Qcells expects to make solar panels and their components in the United States to take advantage of President Biden's climate policies.
The climate and tax bill President Biden signed in August to increase the use of green energy and electric cars while expanding domestic manufacturing appears to be yielding some results.
A Korean solar company, Hanwha Qcells, announced on Wednesday that it would spend $ 2.5 billion to build a large manufacturing complex in Georgia. The plant will produce critical components for solar panels and build complete panels. If realized, the company's plans could bring some of the supply chain for solar energy, which is largely based in China, to the United States.
Qcells, which has its headquarters in Seoul, said it was making the investment to take advantage of tax credits and other benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act, the law Mr. Biden signed last summer. The manufacturing complex is expected to create 2,500 jobs in Cartersville, Ga., roughly 50 miles northwest of Atlanta, and at an existing plant in Dalton, Ga. Production at the new plant is expected to start in 2024.
The company opened its first solar panel manufacturing plant in Georgia in 2019, quickly becoming one of the largest U.S. producers -- by the end of last year, it was cranking out 12,000 panels a day. The company said its new complex would increase its capacity to 60,000 panels a day.
"As demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we're ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American-made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels," Justin Lee, chief executive of Qcells, said in a statement.
Senator Jon Ossoff, Democrat of Georgia, and the state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, have aggressively courted renewable energy, battery and automotive companies to the state. Several of those investments have come from South Korea, including a planned electric vehicle plant by Hyundai.
"With a focus on innovation and technology, Georgia continues to set itself apart as the No. 1 state for business," Mr. Kemp said in a statement.
In 2021, Mr. Ossoff introduced a bill, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, that would have provided tax incentives to solar manufacturers. The bill was later incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act.
Under the legislation, businesses receive a tax credit at every stage of the supply chain. The act includes an estimated $ 30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and for the processing of critical minerals. The law also offers an investment tax credit to companies that build factories that produce electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.
Those and other provisions are intended to reduce reliance on China, which dominates the supply chain for crucial raw materials and components for batteries and solar panels. In addition to the fear that the United States was losing ground in important technologies, lawmakers have also been concerned that some Chinese producers are using forced labor.
"I wrote and passed into law legislation precisely intended to attract this type of manufacturing," Mr. Ossoff said in an interview. "It's the largest solar manufacturing in U.S. history coming to Georgia. This economic and geostrategic competition will continue, but my law has brought the United States back into the fight to secure our energy independence."
Lawmakers and administrations from both parties have long sought to boost a domestic solar manufacturing industry, including by imposing tariffs and other restrictions on imported solar panels. But such efforts have, so far, achieved only modest results. Most of the solar panels installed in the United States are imported.
The new plant "will bring back our supply chains so we aren't reliant on other countries, lower the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis," Mr. Biden said in a statement. "And, it will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at home."
The Qcells project and others could reduce U.S. reliance on imports, but not quickly. China and other Asian countries have had a huge head start in assembling panels and producing the parts that go into them. Governments there have also used subsidies, energy policy, trade agreements and other tactics to help domestic producers.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred new investment, it has also raised tensions between the Biden administration and U.S. allies like France and South Korea.
For example, the law offers tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for the purchase of electric cars, but it is only available on vehicles made in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Consumers seeking to buy models made by Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia would not be eligible for at least two years until the company's new Georgia plant begins production in 2025.
Still, energy and auto executives have said that on the whole, the legislation should benefit their businesses, which struggled to get important parts when the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine wrecked global supply chains.
Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said he expected more companies to announce plans for new solar equipment factories in the United States in the first six months of the year. His group estimates that between 2030 and 2040, U.S. plants will be able to meet all of the country's demand for solar panels.
"We see this in the medium to longer term as a very, very large contributor to lower prices in the United States," Mr. Carr said referring to the cost of panels.
Several other solar companies have announced new U.S. manufacturing plants in recent months, including CubicPV, a start-up backed by Bill Gates that plans to begin production of solar panel components in 2025.
Another company, First Solar, said in August that it would build its fourth panel manufacturing plant in the United States. First Solar plans to invest $ 1.2 billion to expand its operations and add 1,000 jobs.

New Korean War Memorial Is Riddled With Errors

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
An arc of gleaming black granite slabs etched with 36,634 names was unveiled on the National Mall over the summer, built to honor American service members who died fighting in the Korean War.
People like Frederick Bald Eagle Bear, an Army corporal who was killed as he rallied his infantry squad to fend off an enemy attack.
And Walder McCord, a bomber pilot who crashed during a night mission. And John Koelsch, a helicopter pilot who was shot down trying to rescue another pilot, died in captivity and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
But Koelsch’s name is spelled wrong, McCord’s name is not on the wall at all, and the name of Frederick Bald Eagle Bear, a member of the Lakota tribe, is so mangled that the polished granite lists him as Eagle B F Bald.
There are hundreds more mistakes like those.
“It’s just a damn mess — full of old bookkeeping errors and typos,” said Hal Barker, a historian who, together with his brother, Edward Barker Jr., maintains a vast online repository of information about the conflict, a trove known as the Korean War Project.
The brothers estimate that the $22 million wall of remembrance — an addition to the 27-year-old Korean War Veterans Memorial — contains 1,015 spelling errors. It also incorrectly includes 245 names of service members who died in circumstances totally unrelated to the war, they say, including a man killed in a motorcycle accident in Hawaii and another who drank antifreeze thinking it was alcohol. And it includes one Marine who lived for 60 years after the war and had eight grandchildren.
Beyond that, there are about 500 names that should be listed but are not, according to the Barkers. They say that the official roster used for the wall was so slapdash that they cannot find much rhyme or reason to who was included and who was left out.
For example, records show that when McCord’s bomber crashed, nine crew members aboard were killed, but the names of only three are included on the wall. In another case, a Navy plane collided with an Air Force plane off Japan, killing both pilots; the Navy pilot is on the wall, but the Air Force pilot is not.
How did it all go so wrong? Through the shared missteps of several federal agencies and a veterans’ group that failed to devote the time, money and scrutiny needed to prepare an accurate list, probably ensuring that even more time, money and scrutiny will be required to fix it.
The granite slabs were erected by the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation to recognize a largely forgotten conflict that left more than 1 million people dead and a country divided. The money for the project was largely provided by the government of South Korea. Like other monuments on the mall, the slabs are maintained by the National Park Service. The error-riddled list of names was supplied by the Defense Department. And no one seems to have checked it.
The foundation declined to comment. The park service deflected blame to the Defense Department. The Defense Department declined to make decision-makers available for comment. In response to questions from The New York Times, it acknowledged that there were errors on the wall, saying in a statement that compiling an accurate list was “challenging.”
“We encourage all family members or concerned citizens to notify the Department of any names that were omitted, misspelled, or included in error,” the statement said, adding that the department would work with the park service to make any necessary corrections or additions, although they did not offer any details of how the granite could be fixed.
The brothers said they could think of no options but tearing out the slabs and starting over.
It is not the first time the department has botched casualty figures from the conflict in Korea, where three years of bitter fighting ended in stalemate and an armistice in 1953. For nearly 50 years afterward, the official number of American dead from the conflict was 54,246, a number published in history books, quoted in speeches and etched in stone when the Korean War memorial was unveiled. But in 2000, the Pentagon acknowledged that the figure included all troops who had died anywhere, for any reason, during the war years, and that the true number of war deaths was 36,516.
Before the carving started on the new wall of names, the Barker brothers repeatedly warned planning commissioners, military officials and eventually even the White House about problems with the list, records show. But the process lumbered forward.
“No one bothered to check it before they set it in stone,” said Edward Barker Jr., who goes by Ted.
War memorials that recognize thousands of people were once rare.
In recent generations, however, engraved lists have come to be almost expected, as society grew more focused on individuals. Major memorials like those for the Vietnam War and the Sept. 11 terror attacks now prioritize listing masses of people name by name.
But as the Korean War wall of remembrance shows, efforts to be inclusive can instead call attention to who was left out. Should the wall include a nurse killed in a plane crash on her way to the war zone? What about a Marine who died by suicide a month after coming home? Even with the best proofreading, any attempt to recognize all who died in as complex an event as a war will inevitably involve hard decisions.
For that reason, the National Park Service repeatedly opposed adding the Korean War memorial wall when it was proposed. The service had already waded through controversy over the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, just across the Mall’s reflecting pool, where factions faced off over who deserved to be listed. Years of arguments and lobbying led to the addition of more than 380 names to that granite wall, including one man who died 28 years after he was wounded in Vietnam.
“There is not always agreement on those names to be included,” the parks service’s deputy director for operations at the time, Peggy O’Dell, warned at a congressional hearing in 2016. “Choosing some names and omitting others causes a place of solace to become a source of hurt.”
Erika Doss, a professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame who has written extensively about monuments, said that Americans increasingly saw recognizing individuals as critical. “We see ourselves as a nation of individuals, so listing the names becomes unifying,” she said. But she wondered how so solemn a gesture could have gotten so flawed this time. She asked, “Didn’t they have an editor?”
The mistakes might have attracted little notice if not for the Barker brothers.
Ted, 77, and Hal, 75, both 5 foot 6 and partial to loose jeans and white running shoes, share a two-bedroom apartment outside Dallas where, over the years, more and more living space has been ceded to their research. Walls are covered with bulletin boards. Out-of-print books and binders stuffed with obscure infantry rosters weigh down sagging shelves. Hal’s bed is little more than a cot, pushed into a corner to make room for a sprawling homemade desk with six computer monitors where he maintains their project’s website.
The brothers began what they readily admit has become an obsession more than 40 years ago, hoping to better understand their father, Lt. Col. Edward L. Barker, a Marine pilot whose portrait hangs in their hall. He was often brooding and quick to anger, Hal said: “A good Marine, but a bad father.”
The colonel, who died in 2009, had a uniform that gleamed with ribbons, including a Silver Star, but Hal said that whenever the brothers asked what he did in the Korean War, their father responded, “None of your damn business.”
Hal majored in history in college, and after graduating, he sought out veterans who could tell him about his father. That led to collecting oral histories of nearly forgotten battles. Ted got involved as the project grew, and the brothers created the website in 1995 to share their findings. The site has grown to thousands of pages of maps, photographs and profiles, crowdsourced by veterans and their families and meticulously curated by the brothers.
In the 1990s, as part of their research, the Barkers started cobbling together a list of all Americans who died in the war. It was based largely on military personnel records entered on IBM punch cards in the 1950s. The cards had room for only a limited number of characters, and could not accommodate hyphenated or multi-word surnames like Bald Eagle Bear, so hundreds of names got scrambled.
Much of the data has since been converted to modern digital files, but the errors introduced in the punch-card era endured. So the brothers started checking their list against personnel files, census rolls and gravestones — work that has taken years.
“People ask us how we could spend so much effort doing this,” Ted Barker said. “I say, how could we not? We feel we owe it to these guys.”
Around 2010, a group of veterans running the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation began lobbying to add a memorial wall to the existing monument. When the foundation asked the Barkers for names, the brothers said they could supply a list but warned that a lot of correction work would still be needed.
The foundation pushed ahead, and in 2016, despite National Park Service opposition, Congress authorized the wall. Tucked in the legislation, though, was something the park service insisted on. Because the park service feared that a protracted public process like the one for the Vietnam memorial would yield another divisive mess, the law required that the office of the Secretary of Defense decide on and issue the list of names, all at once with no outside input.
In a statement, the park service said the accuracy of the list was the responsibility of the foundation and the Defense Department. That statement concluded, “We will continue to work with those organizations to ensure that the names engraved on the memorials are as accurate as possible.”
The National Park Service’s legislative provision created a problem: All the Pentagon had were its old, error-ridden records, without the Barkers’ corrections. The brothers say they emailed the Defense Department repeatedly to offer their services, but the department was unresponsive.
Then the brothers noticed something odd happening: The Korean War Project website started to be visited thousands of times a day by computers associated with civilian researchers hired by the Defense Department. The brothers grew suspicious that the Defense Department might be paying people to vacuum up their decades of research, rather than engaging directly with them, so in 2020, they sharply limited access to the data and the corrections they had made.
The Defense Department did not respond to questions about the brothers’ suspicions.
The foundation, whose leaders by now were in their 80s and 90s, pushed the government to deliver a list, as required by law, so the memorial wall could be completed.
The foundation did not make leaders available for comment for this article.
The Pentagon delivered its list in 2021. When the Barkers saw proofs of what would be carved into the granite, they again raised the alarm but said they received little response.
Truth be told, the brothers agreed, they never liked the idea of a wall of names. It not only draws dividing lines among the dead, they said, it ignores those who lived — men like their father who came home but were forever scarred by their experiences.
“A wall should have never been done,” Ted Barker said. “But now that it has been done, we need to get it right.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: The inaugural Frieze Seoul fair was one sign of the city's ascent. Now a dealer invasion is underway and artists are navigating a new landscape, as competition heats up.
SEOUL -- One recent afternoon in the vibrant Itaewon neighborhood, art types trickled into a four-story building that the Berlin and Paris gallery Esther Schipper had just unveiled as a showroom, to catch an interactive performance by the artist Tino Sehgal. It involved a girl, in character, delivering a short monologue and addressing questions to her audience. At one point, she turned to an artist on hand and asked, "Would you rather feel too busy or not busy enough?" Not a fair question: Anyone trying to keep up with art in this art-mad city hardly has a choice.
New museums are opening, foreign galleries are alighting and corporations are plowing money into contemporary art. Frieze opened a fair here in September, some 120 exhibitors strong, and the international art world flew in. At Samsung's palatial Leeum Museum of Art, "Squid Game" stars and visiting museum curators watched the K-pop girl group Kep1er. At a club in the industrial Euljiro neighborhood, the artist Haegue Yang hosted a blowout that lasted into the early morning. Finally, after cautious pandemic management, this metropolitan area of 26 million -- that's half the country's population in an area the size of Connecticut -- felt gloriously alive.
Amid the action, one young gallery worker told me he was proud that Frieze, which has editions in London, New York and Los Angeles, had picked South Korea instead of rival Japan for its first fair in Asia. And the Seoul-born art dealer, Jason Haam, 32, enthused in an interview, "It's kind of like the World Cup or Olympics coming into this country." It is an exhilarating moment for art and a complicated one, as everyone navigates rapid changes, sizes up the newcomers and angles for position, as economic fears loom.
"I think it was long overdue that people recognized Seoul, Korea, as an art hub," said Emma Son, the senior director at Lehmann Maupin's gallery here. She has been in Seoul's gallery sector for more than two decades and was sitting in her office, next to a painting by the midcareer Korean artist Keunmin Lee, who channels body horror in virtuosic near-abstractions. Lehmann Maupin, which also has New York and London branches, moved into its elegant two-floor space this year, after opening a smaller showroom in 2017. Pace has also expanded dramatically, and Perrotin just added a second space. Almost 300 galleries were counted in Seoul in a 2020 survey by the Korea Arts Management Service, a government agency.
A dealer invasion is underway. In March, Tang Contemporary Art (Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong) moved into a capacious exhibition hall in the ultrawealthy Cheongdam area. In April, Peres Projects, a talent-spotting outfit in Berlin and Milan, grabbed a shop in the ritzy Shilla Hotel; it is now prepping a gallery in Samcheong, the preserve of mainstays like Hyundai and PKM. That same month, Gladstone (three New York galleries, one in Brussels) also landed in Cheongdam, where König (Berlin, London) set up in 2021 on the upper floors of an MCM store.
The collector base in South Korea "is big, but it's not as big as China, or the U.S. or Europe," Son said, "so the competitiveness is going to be tough between the galleries."
It may soon be tough between South Korea and other locales, as well. Hong Kong's political crackdown and strict coronavirus quarantine helped Seoul, but those rules have been dropped. Japan has loosened its tax rules for art, and a fair is on tap for Tokyo this summer from a team that includes the founders of what became Art Basel Hong Kong and that is also behind one starting Jan. 12 in another wealthy Asian city: Singapore.
The foreign influx has its pluses and minuses. "It is pretty nice for me because I can see those works that I would have had to see somewhere else," while traveling, said Kyungmin Lee in the basement office of Whistle, the Itaewon gallery for emerging artists she started in 2017.
Though major international galleries are coming to Seoul, they are "still separated from the Korean art scene," said the curator Haeju Kim, who organized this year's Busan Biennale in that city on the southern coast. Even the arrivals with big-name Korean artists on their rosters have largely focused on exhibiting European and American talent. In its first year in business here, Thaddaeus Ropac, a European heavyweight, did that exclusively, showing only men. (This week it opens an exhibition of three Korean female artists on the rise.)
Blue-chip dealers and deep-pocketed collectors are, of course, only two parts of a viable industry. Art scenes rise or fall on their emerging artists. While this is difficult to measure, it feels far more challenging for a vanguard-minded young local artist to be represented by a gallery in Seoul than it would be in, say, New York, which is comparatively abundant in dealers eager to take risks on the new and untested.
"I want galleries to be more open to more experimental things," the artist Haena Yoo told me, taking a break at a coffee shop near her studio on a weekend morning. Yoo, 32, makes intricate sculptures and installations that incorporate organic substances and plumb how goods and identities are packaged and transform as they flow across borders. Homemade meju, a brick of fermented soybeans used in many Korean dishes, figures in some of her work. (She made sure to get a studio with a kitchen.)
Yoo was readying a solo show at Gallery Shilla, a veteran of the city of Daegu that opened here in 2021. After college in Seoul, she got her M.F.A. in California, and now splits her time between Los Angeles and the Korean capital. She said that she has seen dealers here become more intrepid in the past couple of years, perhaps spurred on by the expectations of younger patrons and all the new competition. Local ventures like P21, Gallery 2, Cylinder and BB & M have been injecting fresh energy.
Whistle came about when Lee, 38, wanted "to have some kind of opportunity for younger artists to show in a professional way, because it was lacking," she said. One of two Korean galleries in Frieze Seoul's section for emerging Asian galleries, it presented wily abstractions of flat, bright color by the Korean artist Hejum Bä. Some local collectors had been waiting more than a year for a Bä but ceded their planned purchases to foreigners -- "they want international collectors to collect the work and for her to be more well known," Lee said. "I collect, and it's really not easy to let it go. I almost cried. Everyone was so supportive."
The hope among many artists and dealers here is that this newfound attention will endure, and open doors beyond Korea. (The worry is that this may be a largely one-way relationship, with multinational galleries simply selling to a new market.) There are astonishingly talented artists here who have shown abroad only sparingly, like Heecheon Kim, an incisive video maker; Yooyun Yang, who conjures cinematic scenes from traditional ink-and-paper painting; Rondi Park, who makes hilarious works in every medium that are cut through with pathos; and Haneyl Choi, who crafts spare, enigmatic, queer sculptures.
The government has been providing grants to push along that process, helping artists and dealers exhibit widely, intent on generating a hallyu, or "Korean wave" that has propelled K-pop and Korean cinema to worldwide prominence. Korean corporations -- the family-owned conglomerates known as chaebol that have long been art buyers and philanthropists -- have also funded art initiatives abroad.
On the home front, too, there are government efforts to bolster art-making. "Korea has a good public-funding structure for residencies and studio spaces," said Sook-Kyung Lee, who started her career in the 1990s at South Korea's National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA). She is now senior curator of international art at Tate Modern in London. "Compared to Britain, it's just so much better," she said. Agencies give grants for artists to publish catalogs and stage exhibitions, though some criticize the mechanics of the process, which involves onerous paperwork and the use of funds to rent venues for brief runs.
Real estate is pricey in Seoul -- and most galleries are modest by Chelsea standards -- but people find ways to make it work. Scrappy alternative galleries, many run by artists, dot neighborhoods like Euljiro, Mullae and Seochon, and slices of the Mapo district. (Stalwarts includes WESS, Factory 2, Space 413, Sarubia and Saga.) For better and for worse, they can feel disconnected from the commercial sphere, and they come and go with heartbreaking speed.
"To be honest, at the start, I didn't mean to do this," Jungmin Cho said at one such space, White Noise, which she directs. It is in a basement with low ceilings that once held a catering business in a stretch of the Bangbae neighborhood lined with cozy cafes. "I was just gathering my friends and doing fun, experimental things without thinking about the future."
That was in 2018. People told her to keep it going. For one night, on Dec. 30, White Noise hosted its 37th project, with Lilbiitz (a "creative food project team") offering dishes inspired by the gallery's 2022 shows. The week of Frieze, Cho had artists make presentations of their work at a design shop before it was auctioned off, live, as a D.I.Y. sendup of that market ritual.
When it comes to the global art market, South Korea remains a minor player. Its total art sales in 2021 were 922.3 billion won (about $ 726 million at the current exchange rate), according to a report from Seoul National University and the Paradise Cultural Foundation. China's were around $ 13 billion, per an Art Basel and UBS survey. Auction turnover in Hong Kong alone was $ 1.7 billion for that year, according to Artprice -- more than six times South Korea's total.
But the major houses are taking an interest. Christie's staged a blockbuster exhibition of Francis Bacon and Adrian Ghenie during Frieze Seoul; Sotheby's hired Jane Yoon (formerly of Phillips) to open a new office, and Minhee Suh has joined Phillips as regional director after a dozen years at the local K Auction. In an interview, Suh described how she has seen collecting change. "Before it was just like a hobby," she said. Now "it's a kind of culture."
What is particularly striking about being in South Korea right now is the sense of possibility in the air. About 80 percent of its art museums -- more than 200 -- were established after 2000, according to the Korea Arts Management Service. The Seoul Museum of Art has seven branches in the city, and is readying three more. The federal government, meanwhile, is planning another for the hulking collection of art, books, and antiquities donated by the family of the Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who died in 2020.
Samsung's cultural foundation has two museums of its own -- the Leeum and, just south of Seoul, the Ho-Am, which will reopen in April after a renovation. Other corporate giants, like SK and Amorepacific, also operate art institutions. In 2021, ST International (an energy concern) inaugurated a striking building for its headquarters and its art nonprofit, SongEun, which focuses on up-and-coming Korean figures.
"We wanted -- through the architecture, through making a landmark with Herzog & de Meuron -- more exposure for our young artists," said SongEun's artistic director, Laurencina Farrant-Lee.
The pace of building in South Korea awes, but there are gripes that the quality of public exhibitions, and professional standards, varies widely. Many public collections remain in nascent stages, and their acquisition budgets are not large.
The national museum, MMCA, had about $ 4 million for art buys in 2021, which would not cover half of the roughly $ 11.2 million that a collector, Kim Woong-ki, paid in 2019 for a 1971 Kim Whanki painting, the record price for Korean art at auction. It is a radiant, swirling work of minute blue marks, and it was just on view at a new art venue in an office building associated with Global Sae-A Group (clothing and more), where Kim is chairman. (Some have called for South Korea to adopt tax incentives for donating art to museums.)
Even as the city's art scene expands, there is a measure of nervousness. The Korean won has started to recover after a rough year, but economic uncertainty remains. If Frieze had been in 2021, "it would have been so much crazier," said Haam, the dealer, who opened his gallery in 2018 in an Italian restaurant that he gutted in the moneyed Seongbuk district. During Frieze, new paintings by the blue-chipper Urs Fischer hung on his walls, a feat for a young dealer with only a few years' experience.
Haam's parents are collectors, and while studying at Cornell University, he started selling art to his mother's friends back home, building an international roster. "I felt like I had a little bit of a safe haven here, especially at the incubation stage of the gallery," he said.
Those days are certainly over, but even as the scene gets crowded, Haam remains bullish, with plans to expand in Seoul. "Twenty years from now, if the country is as rich as it is right now," he said, "I think it can be like London or New York."

Full text: Court records unsealed this week provided vital and unsettling new details about the night four University of Idaho students were killed.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- After weeks of unease over the murders of four University of Idaho students in a house near campus, the authorities this week released their most detailed account yet of the investigation that led them to arrest a criminology student from a nearby university.
The documents detail an array of evidence about the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, 28, a graduate student at Washington State University, who said through a lawyer that he looks forward to being exonerated. The records also provided jarring new details about the night the four students were murdered, while raising fresh questions about a mystifying case in which authorities have not explained a possible motive.
Here are 10 key revelations made public on Thursday.
A roommate saw a masked man.
Investigators had previously suggested that two roommates who were inside the house on the night of the crime and were not attacked had been sleeping. But the records show that one of them awoke around 4 a.m. after hearing noises, a man's voice and crying. That was around the time the authorities believe the killings occurred.
That roommate, according to the records, eventually watched from her room as a man in black clothing with a mask on his face walked past her toward the home's back door. She reported locking her own bedroom door at that point, but it's unclear from the records what transpired afterward.
Authorities were not summoned to the scene for more than seven hours.
Investigators found a knife sheath at the scene.
On an upstairs bed where two victims -- Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves -- were found dead, investigators said they found a tan leather knife sheath.
The police said they were able to get a DNA sample from a button snap on the sheath, and later found a connection between that sample and DNA collected from Mr. Kohberger's parents' home in Pennsylvania.
That may prove to be a key piece of evidence, as authorities seek to tie Mr. Kohberger to the scene of the crime.
The suspect applied to work at a local police department.
Mr. Kohberger had long taken an interest in criminology and criminal law.
He studied in Pennsylvania in part under Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychologist whose books include "The Mind of a Murderer" and "How to Catch a Killer." He researched the psychology of criminals when they committed crimes.
At Washington State University, he was pursuing a Ph.D., engaging in a class on DNA evidence and forensics in the weeks before the killings, while continuing to grade papers in the weeks afterward.
Authorities also disclosed that Mr. Kohberger had applied in recent months for an internship at the police department in Pullman, Wash., less than 10 miles from the University of Idaho campus in Moscow. He wrote an essay as part of the application in which he described his interest in helping rural police departments collect and analyze data.
A car passed the victims' house several times.
On the night of the killings, investigators said, a white automobile could be seen on surveillance footage repeatedly passing through the dead-end street where the victims lived.
The vehicle, which the police said was a Hyundai Elantra, started appearing around 3:29 a.m., passing by the area three times before returning for a fourth time at 4:04 a.m., around the time that the surviving roommate was awakened and that the police believe the killings occurred. The vehicle, the police said, could be seen speeding away from the area at 4:20 a.m.
Audio captured a dog barking.
At around 4:17 a.m., a security camera near the home of the victims picked up distorted audio of what sounded like a whimper and a loud thud, investigators said. They also said a dog could be heard barking numerous times.
After the killings were discovered, police officers arriving at the house found a dog in one of the rooms. The dog belonged to one of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves.
One of the victims may have been awake.
While the coroner has said that all four victims were probably asleep at the time of the killings, investigators suggested in the new court records that at least one of them may have been awake.
Xana Kernodle received a DoorDash delivery around 4 a.m., just before the arrival of the white vehicle, the investigators said. A forensic review of her phone also suggested that she was using the TikTok app at around 4:12 a.m.
A campus officer found Kohberger's car.
With the surveillance video in hand, the police began scouring the region for white Hyundai Elantras, and a campus police officer at Washington State University found one in November registered to Mr. Kohberger.
Investigators said they reviewed images of Mr. Kohberger and found that his physical appearance matched the recollection of the roommate who saw a man in the house, including his height, build and bushy eyebrows.
Police initially said they were looking for a 2011-13 Elantra, but later determined that it could also be from a model year as late as 2016. Mr. Kohberger had a 2015 Elantra.
Kohberger's phone disconnected during the killings.
By the end of December, investigators were able to get records of the location of Mr. Kohberger's cellphone.
The records showed that he had visited the neighborhood of the crime scene 12 times before the night of the killings, according to the police affidavit. On the night of the killings, his phone was in Pullman at 2:47 a.m., but then disconnected from the cell network.
The phone reconnected to the network at 4:48 a.m., at a location miles to the south of the University of Idaho. The phone eventually traveled back to Pullman.
The police suggest that the suspect may have returned to the crime scene.
Several hours after the killings, at around 9:12 a.m., Mr. Kohberger's phone was detected in Moscow, connecting to the cellular network near the scene of the murders and staying there for nine minutes, according to the police records.
The phone then returned to the area of his home in Pullman. At that point in the morning, no one had called 911, so the police had not yet gone to the crime scene.
A DNA sample was taken from trash in Pennsylvania.
In the days after obtaining Mr. Kohberger's phone records, investigators were in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kohberger had driven for the holidays with his father.
Agents there recovered trash from the home of Mr. Kohberger's family and shipped it to Idaho. Investigators said they worked to match a DNA profile found in the trash to a DNA sample collected from the knife sheath found at the crime scene. The analysis, the police said, suggested a strong likelihood that the elder Mr. Kohberger was the father of whoever left DNA on the knife sheath.

Full text: On the night four college students were killed, a roommate saw a man clad in black walk through the home. It took a cross-country investigation to find a suspect.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- On the night in November when four University of Idaho students were murdered in a home near campus, another roommate awoke to a noise that she thought was her friend playing with her dog. Then she heard someone crying, and a man saying something like, "It's OK, I'm going to help you."
When the roommate peered out of her room just after 4 a.m., she later told investigators, she stood in "frozen shock" as a man wearing black clothes and a mask walked by her toward the home's back door. She did not recognize him, she said, but she noticed his bushy eyebrows.
It was not until many hours later that the full extent of what had happened upstairs and down the hall became clear: Four students had been stabbed to death, leaving two roommates -- and a dog whose barking had been loud enough to be heard outside -- alive.
On Thursday, law enforcement officials ended nearly two months of silence on the details of their investigation and unveiled an array of evidence they say left them with little doubt about the identity of the killer: Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old Ph.D. student in criminology at a neighboring university.
Mr. Kohberger, who was arrested on Dec. 30 at his parents' home in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, appeared in court for the first time in Idaho on Thursday to face charges of first-degree murder and felony burglary.
In a packed courtroom where the father of one victim was sitting in the front row, Mr. Kohberger hardly spoke except to say that he understood that the maximum penalty for each murder charge was life imprisonment or death. His public defender, Anne Taylor, said in court that Mr. Kohberger "has a good family that stands behind him." He has said through another lawyer that he looks forward to being exonerated.
Authorities have yet to detail a motive in the killings, nor has there been any explanation for why the two surviving roommates, who are also students at the University of Idaho, did not call 911 until shortly before noon the next day.
But in a small college town that had not recorded a murder in seven years, the newly unsealed court records offer a detailed account of how police officers, with the aid of dozens of F.B.I. agents, methodically triangulated clues. Among them were DNA found on a knife sheath left at the scene, surveillance cameras in the neighborhood, cellphone tower records and DNA from the suspect's father collected from the family's trash in Pennsylvania -- all of which, the police said, pointed to Mr. Kohberger.
The early morning attack at the house along a dead-end street, a five-minute walk from campus, claimed the lives of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.
It came after an otherwise typical Saturday night. Ms. Kernodle and Mr. Chapin, who were dating, had attended a fraternity party together, and Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen had gone to a bar. All four victims, as well as the two surviving roommates, were back at the home before 2 a.m.
The new documents suggest that Ms. Kernodle was awake around the time of the killings, receiving a DoorDash delivery around 4 a.m. and apparently using the TikTok app on her phone 12 minutes later. Police said the murders likely happened before 4:25 a.m.
In addition to hearing the crying and the man's voice, the roommate on the second floor also heard one of her roommates say something like, "There's someone here," around 4 a.m.
At roughly the same time, a security camera from a nearby home picked up distorted audio of a whimpering sound and a loud thud. A dog could be heard barking several times.
A variety of surveillance footage collected from the neighborhood gave investigators some of their early leads, showing that, shortly before the crimes, a white Hyundai Elantra had made three passes along the dead-end street where the killings took place. It returned a fourth time, at 4:04 a.m., around the time the surviving roommate said she had woken up.
The vehicle was seen 16 minutes later leaving the neighborhood "at a high rate of speed," according to the affidavit, which was signed by Cpl. Brett Payne of the Moscow Police.
Investigators began scouring the region for similar cars. At the end of November, a campus police officer at Washington State University, which is about a 15-minute drive from the University of Idaho and the crime scene, discovered that an Elantra belonging to Mr. Kohberger was registered with the university.
The investigators soon found from Mr. Kohberger's driver's license that he matched the roommate's description of the man in the mask, including, they say, the bushy eyebrows.
In December, Mr. Kohberger drove home to Pennsylvania with his father for winter break while investigators were still piecing together their case. Two days before Christmas, the police were able to obtain cellphone tower records showing that on the night of the killings, Mr. Kohberger's phone had stopped connecting to cell towers somewhere near his apartment in Pullman at 2:47 a.m. before reconnecting somewhere south of Moscow at 4:48 a.m. -- suggesting that his phone had either traveled out of a coverage area or been turned off.
His phone had already been in the area of the house 12 times in the months before the murders, according to the affidavit.
He appears to have also been back in the vicinity of the house hours after the killings, but before the victims were found, according to the court affidavit. Cell tower records showed that his phone had traveled from Pullman back to Moscow, connecting for nine minutes to the cell network that services the neighborhood of the crime scene.
Investigators had another key piece of evidence: the DNA sample found on the button snap of a tan leather knife sheath that had been left on a bed next to the bodies of Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen.
In December, investigators traced Mr. Kohberger to his parents' house in Pennsylvania. On Dec. 27, while he was there over winter break, the police managed to retrieve some garbage from the house and sent what appears to have been a DNA sample from Mr. Kohberger's father for testing. The results showed a strong probability that the elder Mr. Kohberger was the father of whoever left DNA on the knife sheath.
In a predawn raid on Dec. 30, the police broke through windows and doors of the family home and arrested the younger Mr. Kohberger. They followed up quickly with searches of his apartment in Pullman, the white Hyundai Elantra he had driven with his father to Pennsylvania and the parents' home. They also got a court order to obtain a direct DNA sample from Mr. Kohberger.
Friends of the victims have been searching for possible connections between the victims and the accused killer -- so far, disclosing none -- and classmates of Mr. Kohberger's at Washington State University have examined their own recollections to try to identify clues.
Some said Mr. Kohberger spent time studying the exact kind of techniques that the police used in recent weeks to identify him, and had a deep interest in criminal psychology and crime scenes.
Benjamin T. Roberts, a fellow graduate student at Washington State, said Mr. Kohberger had been interested in areas like psychology and Rational Choice Theory, which suggests that offenders may often try to assess the potential costs and benefits of committing a crime.
"He took the field of study very seriously," Mr. Roberts said.
But peers also said he at times caused conflict in the program. Mr. Roberts recalled that Mr. Kohberger tended to be more forceful and condescending in challenging the ideas of female students during discussions in classroom settings.
"There was a consistent pattern in which he would push back more with women colleagues than with male colleagues," he said.
One new revelation in the court affidavit had a tinge of irony: After enrolling in the Ph.D. program at Washington State in August, Mr. Kohberger had applied for an internship. In an essay as part of the application, he described his interest in helping rural police departments collect and analyze data as part of public safety operations. The internship he applied for was at the Pullman Police Department, whose officers would wind up helping in the investigation of the murders.

Supply Problems and Falling Demand Hurt Auto Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A global semiconductor shortage is easing, which could allow carmakers to lift production this year. But higher interest rates could keep sales low.
Last year, sales of new cars and trucks fell to their lowest level in a decade because automakers could not make enough vehicles for consumers to buy. This year, sales are likely to remain soft, but for an entirely different reason -- weakening demand.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, which are intended to slow inflation, have made it harder and more expensive for consumers to finance automobile purchases, after prices had already risen to record highs.
Analysts expect that higher rates and a slowing economy will force some U.S. shoppers to delay car purchases or steer away from showrooms altogether in 2023 even if automakers crank out more vehicles than they did last year because they can get more parts.
"For over a decade, low interest rates have helped people buy the big cars that Americans like," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm. "Low rates from the Fed are what made those attractive offers for zero-percent financing and 72-month loans possible, but with the higher rates, it's a pretty unfriendly market for people buying a car."
Edmunds estimates that automakers will sell 14.8 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, which would be well below the sales that automakers became accustomed to in the previous decade.
Analysts expect the industry will have sold fewer than 14 million light trucks and cars last year in the United States once large automakers have reported their deliveries for the year. That would be a decline of more than one million from 2021. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the industry typically sold more than 17 million new vehicles a year.
If the dour estimates are confirmed, last year's sales total will rank as the lowest since 2011, when the industry had only just begun recovering from the financial crisis and sold 12.7 million new cars and trucks.
"It seems likely that rising interest rates are now constraining demand in the retail auto market," Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at the market researcher Cox Automotive, said in a statement. "With record-high prices and elevated loan rates, the pool of potential new-vehicle buyers is shrinking."
Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, said its U.S. sales fell 13 percent in 2022. Honda reported a drop of by 33 percent, and Nissan's sales fell 25 percent. A main reason was the continuing shortage of computer chips, which forced manufacturers to slow or halt production at times over the last two years and left dealers with few vehicles to sell.
Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by number of vehicles sold, said on Wednesday that its U.S. sales fell about 10 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles in 2022. But in an indication that the supply of chips and other parts improved toward the end of the year, the company said sales in the fourth quarter jumped 13 percent from a year earlier.
General Motors was one of the few automakers that bucked the industry trend, reporting a 2.5 percent increase in U.S. sales last year, to 2.3 million vehicles, putting it just ahead of Toyota after G.M. fell to second place for the first time in decades in 2021. G.M. said deliveries in the fourth quarter were up 41 percent.
Sales of G.M.'s electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, rose more than 50 percent to 38,120 for the year. The company also said sales of the GMC Hummer, an electric pickup truck that sells for more than $ 100,000, increased to 854. The company, which has said it aims to do away with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, is counting on several new electric models to increase sales this year.
Another company that did relatively well was Hyundai, the South Korean automaker that sells cars under the Hyundai and Kia brands and that has also made a big push into electric vehicles. It's full-year sales fell just 2 percent, and its fourth-quarter deliveries jumped 29 percent.
Sales were strong for electric vehicles and for companies that specialize in that fast-growing business.
Tesla on Monday reported a 40 percent increase in its global sales for 2022, but its deliveries in the last three months of the year fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's stock, which ended down 65 percent last year, fell 12 percent on Tuesday. It rose 5 percent on Wednesday by the close of trading.
And Rivian, a smaller electric vehicle company, said on Tuesday that it fell several hundred vehicles short of its goal of producing 25,000 trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans in 2022.
Ford Motor is expected to report its sales on Thursday.
Automakers have been hampered by forces beyond their control for much of the past three years. The pandemic forced them to idle factories for two months in 2020. Then, starting in early 2021, they had to limit production because of the chip shortage.
The shortage has eased, and dealer inventories have improved but remain below normal levels. G.M. said its dealers had 410,000 cars in stock, about half the number before the pandemic.
Many automakers are also struggling to acquire enough batteries for their electric cars and trucks. Some people have been waiting months to buy certain models, like Ford's F-150 Lightning and G.M.'s Hummer pickup trucks.
Many consumers who want to buy new vehicles are also staying away from showrooms because the chip shortage has pushed prices higher. The Fed interest rate increases have also effectively made cars more expensive because many people must borrow money to buy a new vehicle.
According to Edmunds, U.S. consumers on average paid $ 47,681 for new vehicles in November, the most recent month for which data is available. That was a record high and up from $ 45,872 in November 2021. And the average monthly payment on car loans rose in the fourth quarter to $ 717 from $ 659, Ms. Caldwell said.

Suspect in Idaho Killings Got New License Plate Days After Murders: [National Desk]

Full text: Records show the suspect's Hyundai Elantra got a new registration in Washington State shortly after four students at the University of Idaho were murdered.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- The man accused of killing four University of Idaho college students received a new license plate for his car five days after the murders, according to records released Wednesday.
The licensing documents in Washington State show that the vehicle driven by the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, was a white Hyundai Elantra, the type of vehicle that investigators had been seeking in recent weeks.
The police in Moscow had said that a white Hyundai Elantra from between 2011 and 2013 had been seen near the scene of the crimes on the night of the killings in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13. Mr. Kohberger's car was a 2015 model and registered on Nov. 18, according to the licensing document. A vehicle history report shows the car had previously been registered in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kohberger is from.
Mr. Kohberger, 28, had moved to Pullman, Wash., in recent months and began studying criminology in a Ph.D. program at Washington State University in August. He has said through a lawyer that he expects to be exonerated in the case. Mr. Kohberger's new lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the license plate records.
On Wednesday, the police in Indiana released new body camera footage showing that, two weeks before Mr. Kohberger was arrested, the police there had pulled him over twice in a 10-minute stretch for tailgating. The traffic stops, on Dec. 15, came as Mr. Kohberger was driving across the country with his father for winter break in the same car for which he had obtained the new license plate.
During both stops, the suspect's father mentioned a fatal police standoff that took place that morning near Washington State University, where his son was a student, and told the officer that he and his son had been discussing the "horrifying" incident.
The police shooting that they were discussing does not appear to have any connection to the four fatal stabbings that occurred about a month earlier in Idaho, just across the border from the W.S.U. campus. Mr. Kohberger is now charged with four counts of murder in the stabbings.
Mr. Kohberger was the driver of the car during both stops, and the new footage is the most that the public has seen of him since he became the subject of intense scrutiny after his arrest. On Wednesday, Mr. Kohberger was flown by the police from Pennsylvania, where he was visiting his parents after the road trip, to Idaho, where he stands accused of stabbing four students to death overnight in their home on Nov. 13.
The Pennsylvania State Police plane touched down at the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport shortly before 6:30 p.m., and Mr. Kohberger was booked into the Latah County Jail in Moscow. Mr. Kohberger's father, Michael Kohberger, visited him in December, and they drove across the country from the W.S.U. campus in Pullman, Wash., to their home in eastern Pennsylvania. During that trip, they were pulled over twice on Dec. 15 for tailgating; in both traffic stops, the officers let the men off with a warning.
There is no indication that the police in Indiana had any idea that Mr. Kohberger would be arrested for the murders, or that they were aware of the police in Moscow, Idaho, saying that a white Hyundai Elantra had been seen near the crime scene on the night of the murders.
During the first stop, at about 10:42 a.m., a deputy with the Hancock County Sheriff's Department pulled Mr. Kohberger and his father over along Interstate 70, just east of Indianapolis. The body camera footage released on Wednesday captured the deputy asking where the two were headed. In response, Mr. Kohberger's father said that they were coming from Washington and had been talking about the police standoff that was unfolding near the Washington State campus that day.
Mr. Kohberger's father told the officer that there had been a "mass shooting." He was corrected by his son, who said, "We don't know if it was a mass shooting," and referred to a SWAT team being called for the standoff. "It's horrifying," Mr. Kohberger's father said in the video. That incident involved a man who the police later said had barricaded himself in an apartment and threatened to kill his roommates before a police officer shot him to death.
At another point in the video, the father said, "We're slightly punchy because we've been driving for hours."
After about three minutes, the deputy said, "Do me a favor and don't follow too close, OK?" and then returned Mr. Kohberger's driver's license and let them go.
Just five minutes later, Mr. Kohberger and his father were pulled over again, this time by an Indiana state trooper who also said that they were tailgating. The audio from the trooper's body camera is obscured by traffic noise, but Mr. Kohberger and his father could be heard telling the officer that they were just stopped minutes earlier. Again, the father brought up the incident that morning at Washington State. The trooper wished them a safe trip and let them go with a warning.
It was two weeks later, on Dec. 30, that the police in Pennsylvania carried out a predawn raid of Mr. Kohberger's parents' home, arresting Mr. Kohberger on suspicion of carrying out the Idaho killings. They also searched his car and executed a warrant to obtain his DNA, officials said. Mr. Kohberger has said through a public defender that he looks forward to being exonerated.
Mr. Kohberger had just completed his first semester at Washington State, which is about a 15-minute drive from the crime scene in Moscow. Classmates said he had shown an interest in the psychology of criminals as well as in forensics.
The murders of the four University of Idaho student victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- and the arrest of Mr. Kohberger have rattled the neighboring college towns of Moscow and Pullman.
The stabbing took place in the early morning hours at a home along a dead-end street a five-minute walk from campus. The police have said that the victims were most likely asleep when they were attacked, and two more roommates were in the home but apparently slept through the killings.
Friends and relatives of the victims are searching for any connection between the victims and Mr. Kohberger, but so far none has been disclosed.
The police have said that the surviving roommates realized something was wrong only late in the morning and believed that one of their roommates had passed out. They called friends to the home and then someone called 911, after which police officers discovered the grisly scene.

Full text: The 28-year-old Ph.D. student accused in the killings will be taken to Idaho to face four counts of murder after making a brief appearance in a Pennsylvania courtroom.
STROUDSBURG, Pa. -- The graduate criminology student accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students agreed in his first public court appearance on Tuesday to be extradited from Pennsylvania to Idaho to face murder charges.
The student, Bryan Kohberger, 28, was arrested in Eastern Pennsylvania on Friday and charged in the overnight killings of four students at a home in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13. Mr. Kohberger had entered a Ph.D. program in criminology and criminal justice at Washington State University last summer and moved to Pullman, Wash., a 20-minute drive across the border from the scene of a crime that horrified and confounded the region.
At a news conference on Tuesday, officials provided the first detailed account of the pre-dawn arrest of Mr. Kohberger at his parents' home in suburban Monroe County, Pa., during which officers broke down the doors and shattered windows to take him into custody.
They said they had executed search warrants to obtain Mr. Kohberger's D.N.A. as well as to search the home and a white Hyundai Elantra that matched the description of a vehicle seen near the crime scene on the night of the killings.
Maj. Christopher Paris of the Pennsylvania State Police said Mr. Kohberger, whose parents were home at the time of the arrest, surrendered during the raid.
The police have not outlined any motive, and officials in Pennsylvania declined to say on Tuesday whether the suspect had a previous connection to the victims. But the authorities in Idaho were expected to release more details in charging documents once Mr. Kohberger was transferred to that state.
At the extradition hearing, Judge Margherita Patti-Worthington said Mr. Kohberger had to be extradited within 10 days. Major Paris said he hoped to send him to Idaho "as soon as possible," though he said it was unlikely to happen on Tuesday night.
The public defender representing Mr. Kohberger in Pennsylvania, Jason LaBar, has said Mr. Kohberger looks forward to being exonerated.
Mr. Kohberger arrived at the courthouse from jail handcuffed and wearing a red jumpsuit. He did not respond to reporters as they shouted questions, including about whether he had carried out the crime. Mr. LaBar said Mr. Kohberger had told him that he was shocked to be considered a suspect in the slayings.
In court, Mr. Kohberger answered a set of standard questions from the judge and then signed a waiver allowing his extradition. When Judge Patti-Worthington asked him if he was mentally ill or taking any medications that would affect his ability to make a decision, he said that he was not.
A woman in the front row of the courtroom wept as the hearing took place, prompting a sheriff's deputy to bring her tissues.
Michael Mancuso, an assistant district attorney in Monroe County, said afterward that Mr. Kohberger may have agreed to be extradited because of an Idaho law that prohibits the release of an affidavit supporting an arrest warrant until a defendant is in the state.
"I definitely believe that one of the main reasons the defendant chose to waive extradition and hurry his return back to Idaho was to need to know what was in those documents," Mr. Mancuso said.
The affidavit was likely to provide more details about what evidence the authorities had connecting Mr. Kohberger to the crime.
On Tuesday evening, a magistrate judge in Latah County, which includes Moscow, issued an order prohibiting all parties in the proceedings -- including lawyers, police officers and other investigators -- from speaking about the case outside of court, other than to refer to public records.
In response to the order from Judge Megan Marshall, the Moscow police said it would "no longer be communicating with the public or the media regarding this case."
The order lasts until a verdict is reached on the charges or a judge modifies the order.
It also emerged on Tuesday that Mr. Kohberger had been pulled over twice for traffic infractions by police officers in Indiana on Dec. 15, while he was driving his Elantra with his father from Washington State University back to Pennsylvania for the holidays.
Indiana State Police released body camera footage from the second of two stops, which was for following too closely behind a truck. It showed that a state trooper had decided to let Mr. Kohberger and his father go with a warning after learning that a sheriff's deputy had also stopped them a few minutes earlier for speeding. There was no reported connection between the stop and the arrest of Mr. Kohberger two weeks later.
A week before the traffic stops, the police in Moscow, Idaho, had begun urging the public to contact the police if they had any information about a white Elantra in the area of the crime scene. The Indiana State Police said they had no "specific information" about a suspect or license plate that could have helped make the connection.
Mr. LaBar said Mr. Kohberger and his father had decided in August, when the semester began, that they would drive across the country to Pennsylvania together during the winter break.
The four University of Idaho student victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- were killed in a home near campus where three of them lived. The one male victim, Mr. Chapin, was there visiting his girlfriend, Ms. Kernodle.
Friends and relatives of at least one victim, Ms. Goncalves, have said that they are looking to see if they can find any connections.
"I'm biased, but if he'd got to know my daughter, I think it'd be impossible for you to hurt her," Ms. Goncalves's father, Steve Goncalves, told NewsNation.
Shanon Gray, a lawyer for the Goncalves family, said family members were planning to attend Mr. Kohberger's initial appearance in Idaho and to have a representative at all subsequent hearings in the prosecution.
"They want to look in his eyes and let him know they are there and are going to be there," he said.
Katie Blomgren, who is studying psychology at the University of Idaho and knew Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen since they were all 11, said she was among those struggling to understand the connections, if any, between Mr. Kohberger and the victims.
"I've never seen him or heard of him," said Ms. Blomgren, 21.
The killings took place after a seemingly typical Saturday night of college partying. Ms. Kernodle and Mr. Chapin had gone to a party at his fraternity, while Ms. Mogen and Ms. Goncalves went to a bar in town. In a statement on Twitter on Monday night, the bar where Ms. Mogen and Ms. Goncalves had spent the night, Corner Club, said the suspect "was not and has not been" at the bar before.
All four victims had arrived back at the house by 2 a.m.
Also in the three-story residence were two female roommates who apparently slept through the killings and were not harmed. The police have said that when the roommates awoke the next morning, they called friends over to the house, not knowing of the horrors that had unfolded on the second and third floors, and then someone in the group called 911.
As details about the killing emerged and no suspect was arrested, many University of Idaho students left Moscow early for Thanksgiving break and did not return afterward, choosing instead to take classes online. Those who did return to campus said they were double-checking the locks on their doors and windows and were avoiding going out at night.
The police have said they believe a long knife was used in the killings but that they have not found the murder weapon.
Mr. Kohberger had enrolled in the Washington State program after studying criminology and psychology at DeSales University in Center Valley, Pa., where he had helped with a study about what people thought about and felt while they committed crimes.
Friends of Mr. Kohberger described him as having long been interested in psychology. He had previously worked as a security guard for the Pleasant Valley School District in Pennsylvania, the same district in which he attended high school.

STROUDSBURG, Pa. — The graduate criminology student accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students agreed in his first public court appearance on Tuesday to be extradited from Pennsylvania to Idaho to face murder charges.
The student, Bryan Kohberger, 28, was arrested in eastern Pennsylvania on Friday and charged in the overnight killings of four students at a home in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13. Kohberger had entered a doctoral program in criminology and criminal justice at Washington State University last summer and moved to Pullman, Washington, a 20-minute drive across the border from the scene of a crime that horrified and confounded the region.

Full text: The arrest of a graduate student in the murder of four University of Idaho students eased fears but raised a troubling new question: What was the motive?
MOSCOW, Idaho -- About two weeks before four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, Bryan Kohberger was sitting in a criminology class at a college just a short drive away, leaning into a conversation about forensics, D.N.A. and other evidence prosecutors use to win convictions.
The 28-year-old graduate student seemed highly engaged in the discussion, a former classmate recalled. It was a subject that had long captivated Mr. Kohberger, who had researched the mind-sets of criminals, studied under a professor in Pennsylvania known for her expertise on serial killers and, for the last few months, pursued a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University, about 10 miles from the Idaho crime scene.
Less than two months later, Mr. Kohberger would be the subject of a criminal inquiry, arrested on Friday and charged with the murder of the four Idaho students.
Investigators have yet to outline a motive, but the details emerging about Mr. Kohberger's deep interest in the psychology of criminals has opened another layer of mystery in a case that has traumatized the college town of Moscow, Idaho, and spawned countless theories from people around the country who followed the case in captivated horror.
Mr. Kohberger was taken into custody on Friday at his parents' home in Effort, Pa., and was ordered to appear at an extradition hearing on Tuesday. Jason LaBar, the public defender in Monroe County who is representing him, said Mr. Kohberger had been following the case with interest but was "shocked" to be arrested.
"He looks forward to being exonerated, is what he said," Mr. LaBar said. Mr. Kohberger, he added, would not oppose the effort to return him to Idaho to face the charges. On Sunday, Mr. LaBar issued a statement from Mr. Kohberger's parents and two sisters saying that they "love and support our son and brother" and had cooperated with the police in an effort to "promote his presumption of innocence." They also offered prayers for the victims.
Mr. Kohberger grew up in suburban eastern Pennsylvania, attending Pleasant Valley High School in Brodheadsville, where former classmates and peers recalled that he had an analytical mind but could sometimes be cruel. Thomas Arntz befriended him while riding the school bus around 2009. He said their friendship ended in 2014 after lighthearted "ribbing and jabbing" between friends turned "meanspirited," with Mr. Kohberger sometimes putting him in a headlock hold.
"Over time it just got so, so bad that I just shut down when I was around him," said Mr. Arntz, now 26. "I eventually just had to cut ties with him."
Mr. Kohberger had struggled with a heroin addiction beginning in high school but had seemed to have moved past it in recent years, friends from Pennsylvania said.
Jack Baylis, who became friends with Mr. Kohberger in eighth grade, said Mr. Kohberger had long been fascinated with why people acted the way they did and had seemed to enjoy his job as a security guard for the Pleasant Valley School District, where he worked for several years until 2021.
The last time Mr. Baylis saw Mr. Kohberger was in 2021, when they shot airsoft guns together in the Poconos. At the time, Mr. Baylis said, Mr. Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra, the same model of car that the police in Moscow said had been spotted near the Idaho victims' home on the night of the attacks.
"I pray he's innocent," Mr. Baylis said.
After earning a psychology degree at a community college in 2018, Mr. Kohberger began studying psychology and later criminal justice at DeSales University, a Catholic institution in Center Valley, Pa. There, he studied in part under Katherine Ramsland, a well-known forensic psychologist whose books include "The Mind of a Murderer" and "How to Catch a Killer." She declined to comment.
Mr. Kohberger was a quiet person who liked to work alone but came across as smart, said Brittany Slaven, who took several classes with him at DeSales. She recalled an instance in one of Dr. Ramsland's classes when students were asked to look at photos of a crime scene and figure out what happened; she said Mr. Kohberger was quick to come up with ideas.
He seemed to show a particular interest in crime scenes and serial killers, Ms. Slaven said.
"At the time it seemed as if he was just a curious student, so if his questions felt odd we didn't think much of it because it fit our curriculum," she said.
In a post on Reddit from about seven months ago, a user who identified himself as Bryan Kohberger sought people who had spent time in prison to take a survey about crimes they had committed. The survey listed Mr. Kohberger as a student investigator working with two professors at DeSales, and it asked respondents to describe their "thoughts, emotions and actions from the beginning to end of the crime commission process."
DeSales University said Mr. Kohberger had received a bachelor's degree there in 2020 and earned a master's degree in June 2022. A spokeswoman for the university said the principal investigator on the crime survey -- Michelle A. Bolger, who is listed on the university website as an associate professor -- and her colleagues would not be granting interviews about their experiences working with Mr. Kohberger. The assistant professor listed as the co-principal investigator, Jeffrey E. Clutter, did not respond to numerous messages.
Mr. Kohberger then moved across the country to Pullman, Wash., where he began the fall semester in August in the graduate criminology program at Washington State University, across the state border from the University of Idaho.
Early in the morning of Nov. 13, following a Saturday night of college town parties and a University of Idaho football game, four college students were found stabbed to death in the rental home in Moscow where three of them lived.
Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, were attacked in at least two separate bedrooms, probably as they slept, according to investigators. The three women lived in the home; Mr. Chapin was spending the night with his girlfriend, Ms. Kernodle.
The brutal nature of the deaths -- the coroner said all four were fatally stabbed with a long knife -- and the lack of any suspect cast a sense of fear across Moscow, a city that had not recorded a homicide in seven years. Students began walking in groups. Residents checked the locks on their doors and windows. A DoorDash driver said she noticed more people were ordering meals delivered to avoid going out after dark. And the police began receiving a wave of calls from nervous residents: a suspicious-looking man, a driver revving an engine, sounds in the night.
Police at both college campuses added security measures, adding patrols and holding self-defense workshops.
At Washington State, Mr. Kohberger was continuing with his studies, his classmates said. B.K. Norton, who was in the same graduate program as Mr. Kohberger, said his quiet, intense demeanor had made some classmates uncomfortable.
Another student said Mr. Kohberger seemed interested in the thought processes of criminals while they committed crimes and less interested in the social factors that might lead people to do so, saying that he believed some people were just bound to break the law. The fellow student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared that speaking publicly could jeopardize his safety, described Mr. Kohberger as the black sheep of the class, often taking contrarian viewpoints and sometimes getting into arguments with his peers, particularly women.
The classmate recalled one instance in which Mr. Kohberger began explaining a somewhat elementary criminology concept to a fellow doctoral student, who then accused him of "mansplaining." A heated back-and-forth ensued and the doctoral student eventually stormed out of the classroom, he said.
Mr. Kohberger was also a teaching assistant in a criminal law class during the fall semester, said Hayden Stinchfield, 20, one of the students in that class. He said that Mr. Kohberger often cast his eyes down while addressing the students, giving the impression that he was uncomfortable.
Students said Mr. Kohberger had a strong grasp of the subject matter but was a harsh grader, giving extensive critiques of assignments and then defending the lower marks when students complained as a group. Later in the fall, roughly around the time of the killings, Mr. Stinchfield said Mr. Kohberger seemed to start giving better grades, and the assignments that once had his feedback scrawled across every paragraph began coming back clean.
"At a certain point he stopped leaving all the notes," he said.
At the time, a growing team of investigators from local and state agencies, as well as more than 60 agents from the F.B.I., had descended on Moscow. Forensics investigators combed the house for physical evidence, including D.N.A., and searched fruitlessly for a murder weapon.
Officials pleaded for tips and videos, while thousands of internet sleuths around the country suggested an array of people as the likely culprit: a former boyfriend of one of the victims, a man who was with two of the victims when they got a meal from a food truck, two roommates who were in the home when the killings occurred but apparently slept through them.
None of the online discussion groups identified Mr. Kohberger. It is not clear how or whether he knew the victims.
The police had tried to tamp down rumors by ruling out several people as suspects, though accusations were flying so fast that it at times appeared they could not do so quickly enough. They withheld nearly all details of the investigation, raising frustrations and prompting some people, including relatives of the victims, to wonder publicly whether the police were up to the task.
Still, investigators worked through the holidays to process thousands of tips and extensive evidence collected in and around the scene. In announcing Mr. Kohberger's arrest on Friday, Moscow's police chief, James Fry, said investigators had located a white Hyundai Elantra but had not yet found a murder weapon.
Chief Fry looked exhausted and almost tearful as he announced the arrest at a news conference, making it clear that investigators were still looking for tips to help resolve the questions they could not yet answer: Did the suspect act alone? What was the motive?
"Be assured the work is not done," Chief Fry said. "This is just getting started."
The arrest left the members of one Facebook discussion group, with more than 166,000 members, stunned.
"I'm baffled," one woman wrote. "Literally everything we know doesn't make sense."
But it has also brought a sense of relief to many in Idaho.
Ms. Goncalves's family members said through a lawyer that they were "relieved that the authorities have someone in custody, and now the journey through the criminal justice system begins."
Katie Blomgren, who is studying psychology at the University of Idaho, had known Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen since she was 11. She spent her 12th birthday with the two girls in a hotel, and she thinks of them every time she looks down at her shins, where she has two scars from trying to jump from a bathtub onto a bed that night. She said she has struggled to feel closure, even after the arrest of Mr. Kohberger.
"There's relief, in feeling like maybe it's not so scary to live here anymore," said Ms. Blomgren, 21. But while an arrest in the case has brought a sense of relief for many of her fellow students, she said she has struggled to find any peace. "For me, it doesn't erase what happened."

MOSCOW, Idaho — Eleven days before four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, Bryan Kohberger was sitting in a criminology class at a college just a short drive away, leaning into a conversation about forensics, DNA and other evidence prosecutors use to win convictions.
