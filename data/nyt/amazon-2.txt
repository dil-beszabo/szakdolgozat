Abstract: None available.

Full text: A series of potential problems, including rising oil prices and labor strikes, have prompted a much warier mood among investors.
The stock market staggered to the end of its worst month of the year so far, dragged down by fears of a looming government shutdown, striking autoworkers, surging oil prices and the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than previously thought. Combined, they are darkening the outlook for the economy.
The S&P 500 declined almost 5 percent in September, its steepest monthly drop in 2023, and extending a more modest loss recorded in August. After fading on Friday afternoon, the index also notched its fourth straight week of losses, its longest losing streak of the year.
Just as a more hopeful outlook appeared to have taken hold among investors, propelled by robust corporate profits and resilient consumer spending, a series of potential problems have begun to arise, giving way to a much warier mood on Wall Street.
As sentiment swings, it highlights the pendulum of worry in the markets between the economy remaining too strong for policymakers intent on stamping out inflation and the looming risks that could suddenly pull growth too far in the opposite direction.
"Sentiment has soured," said Steven Wieting, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth. "There is just a lot of uncertainty."
The flow of money into funds that buy U.S. stocks is roughly flat for the year, according to EPFR Global, a data provider. Nearly $ 1 trillion has flowed into money market funds over the same period, an investment that is tantamount to cash and seen as a haven in times of worry.
Chief among investors' concerns is the prospect of interest rates remaining elevated for longer than previously thought, as the Fed battles inflation by keeping the brakes on the economy.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a measure of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and a crucial interest-rate benchmark around the world, has risen roughly half a percentage point since the start of the month, to almost 4.6 percent. As rates on longer-dated bonds rise, stocks tend to come under pressure, reflecting higher costs for companies and consumers over the long term. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reached 7.31 percent this week, the highest level in nearly 23 years, according to Freddie Mac.
Complicating the Fed's job is a surge in oil prices, threatening to reignite inflation. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, has risen to more than $ 90 a barrel, from around $ 70 three months ago, its highest level in more than a year.
Add a steadily strengthening U.S. dollar to higher yields and rising oil prices and investors face a trio of headwinds to the long-term performance of corporate America and the broader economy.
"That's why investors have been having a tougher time," said Michael Hartnett, an analyst at Bank of America. "My gut feeling is hard-landing risks are growing and growing," referring to the analogy of a slowing economy as a plane touching down on a runway. Policymakers' goal is to steer the economy to a so-called soft landing, cooling inflation without pronounced economic pain.
"If interest rates stay at these kinds of levels, or, God forbid, increase, that has really profound implications for global growth," said Seth Bernstein, the chief executive of AllianceBernstein, a $ 600 billion investment management firm. "It just seems unlikely to me that we have a soft landing," he added.
Working against them is the potential government shutdown that could begin this weekend, which will weigh on growth the longer the stalemate continues. The expanding autoworkers' strike has further tempered growth expectations, though less meaningfully.
The threat of a government shutdown also presents another challenge for the policymakers, delaying the release of economic data that is crucial to navigating the economy through uncertain conditions.
The S&P 500 is still up about 12 percent this year, but remove just seven companies from the index -- the chip maker Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Alphabet -- and the rise is less than 1 percent.
That lack of broader conviction is also reflected in the Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. companies, which is barely positive for the year.
Across the globe, major stocks indexes have slumped over the past month: In dollar terms, Germany's Dax has fallen about 5 percent while Japan's Nikkei and China's CSI 300 lost about 3 percent. China's slumping economy, on which many pinned their hopes for growth, has been a particular worry.
One possible silver lining is that September is often one of the worst months of the year for the stock market, so the downturn may be taken with a pinch of salt. And the government could yet avoid a prolonged shutdown and striking autoworkers could secure a contract before more severe economic effects are felt. Corporate profits are expected to stabilize in the third quarter, after a sharp decline in the second quarter.
But anxiety is in the air. On Tuesday, a measure of consumer sentiment sank further than forecast for the second month in a row, coinciding with the S&P 500's worst day of the week, in which the index fell 1.5 percent.
"The market only a few months ago was worry free amid the belief that the Fed could engineer a soft landing," said Carol Schleif, the chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, "and now the market's worry closet door is wide open as investors raise questions about the economic outlook."

A Chaotic Debate: 'Turn Off the Mic!': [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "5 Takeaways From Another Trump-Free Republican Debate" (nytimes.com, Sept. 28):
Turn off the mic!
Seven people onstage at the same time. Just enough time for the evening's bloviators to spew out their prefabricated talking points. Not enough time for discussions of substance.
And then there's something called rules. In lieu of decorum, our debates have devolved into two hours of rudeness, interruption and incivility. Year after year, moderators exhibit little control or are completely ignored. Candidates with the least to say won't shut up, and those with a cogent thought don't have time to express it.
Suggestion: With a clearly displayed clock, give each candidate a prescribed amount of time for talk and rebuttal. If another candidate interrupts, turn off his or her mike. For further interruptions, deduct minutes from that candidate's talking time.
Would candidates be receptive to such an idea? If not, why?
Karl Abbott
New York
To the Editor:
The smartest man on the G.O.P. debate stage was Donald Trump. He was omnipresent without the necessity of actual presence.
Why would he debate? He has the nomination wrapped up. The taunts ("Donald Trump is missing in action" -- Ron DeSantis; "Voters deserve to hear him defend his record"-- The Wall Street Journal) are futile rhetoric. Mr. Trump will not be provoked. He can continue to go about his business unscathed while watching his frenzied rivals with minuscule ratings continue to flail.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump gets to skate into the nomination on his terms thanks to a Republican Party that can't get enough of him. As Mr. Trump himself used to tweet, "Sad."
William Goldman
Los Angeles
To the Editor:
I'm a very proud, lifelong Democrat. But I like to watch the G.O.P. debate because I enjoy seeing the party implode and eat its own. But I stopped after 45 minutes.
It was simply a bunch of lies, misleading statements and prepared applause lines. Not one of them has any idea how to solve America's problems, nor do they even offer a sensible plan, or in many cases any plan, to do so.
The party will simply anoint the twice-impeached, criminally indicted former POTUS. This is what the party wants, and, in short, nothing and no one will stop this from happening. We are all watching, in slow motion, the game play out before the final out.

Members of Congress, Still Paid in a Shutdown
To the Editor:
How is it that if there is a government shutdown, others suffer and go hungry but members of Congress still get paid? That is obviously wrong and needs to change.

Two Views of Justice
To the Editor:
Re "More Democrats Calling on Menendez to Resign" (front page, Sept. 27):
Senator Robert Menendez is indicted by the Justice Department. Democratic lawmakers across the country call for him to resign.
Donald Trump is indicted by the Justice Department. Republican lawmakers across the country call for investigations into the weaponization of the Justice Department.
Can there be a clearer indication of which group has a higher regard for ethics, morality and the rule of law?

Columbia's Contributions to New York City
To the Editor:
Re "Columbia and N.Y.U. Expand, but Pay Little Tax" (front page, Sept. 27):
Columbia is honored to call New York home, and we are committed to being a responsible and engaged citizen of this city. While we don't profess to be perfect, we take pride in the estimated $ 14.6 billion we contribute in annual economic impact to our community, according to the most recent study by New York's Commission on Independent Colleges & Universities.
But whittling down the university's local contributions to dollars spent ignores the broad array of commitments, large and small, that we have made to this city as one of its oldest and proudest institutional residents.
I could point to the critical role played by the university and our health care providers throughout the pandemic, including providing space and logistical support to house health care workers, or to researchers at our Climate School, who are contributing their time and resources to studying harmful algae blooms in city parks.
Most recently, our faculty and students have volunteered to help asylum seekers who are filing applications for the authorization to work.
Columbia is expanding our commitments to the city. That includes doing more to recruit, admit and support New York City's public school students.
We know this is an all-hands-on-deck moment for New York City, and we are dedicated to contributing in every way we can to assure a bright future for it.

High-Quality TV Shows
To the Editor:
Re "The Era of Prestige TV Is Ending. We're Going to Miss It When It's Gone," by Roy Price (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Sept. 21):
Before Netflix, before Amazon, before HBO, before any of the streamers, was "prestige" content from public broadcasting worldwide. And before that was "Playhouse 90" and other prestige content from the networks of television's early years.
Good content is not just produced by big distributors; look at the range of truly interesting shows that media creators are developing on easily accessible platforms that don't demand big budgets and fancy pedigrees.
Open your eyes beyond your narrow West Coast view, Mr. Price. There's a lot to like out there.

The writer is a former head of children's programming for PBS and vice president at Cartoon Network.
'I Love Dogs,' but Biden's Must Go
To the Editor:
Re "Once Again, a Biden Dog Gives a Bite to an Agent" (news article, Sept. 27):
I love dogs more than I love most humans. That said, I feel it's long past time that Commander, President Biden's German shepherd, is permanently exiled from the White House to a comfortable, safe environment, such as a farm, where he has fewer opportunities to bite people.
I doubt that Mr. Biden wants this outcome, but a dog with his record of biting folks should have been sent away long ago.

Forget the Phone. Tech Pioneers Seek the Next Great Device.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: OpenAI's Sam Altman, the former Apple designer Jony Ive and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son are teaming up to develop a device that could replace the smartphone.
Since founding OpenAI in 2015, Sam Altman has spent many days thinking that the company's generative artificial-intelligence products need a new kind of device to succeed. Since leaving Apple in 2019, Jony Ive, the designer behind the iPhone, iPod and MacBook Air, has been considering what the next great computing device could be.
Now, the two men and their companies are teaming up to develop a device that would succeed the smartphone and deliver the benefits of A.I. in a new form factor, unconstrained by the rectangular screen that has been the dominant computing tool of the past decade, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
The project was described as preliminary, but Mr. Altman and Mr. Ive have developed some early concepts and sought as much as $ 1 billion in funding from SoftBank, the Japanese technology investor led by Masayoshi Son, the people said. With SoftBank's support, the two men could tap into the semiconductor expertise of Arm, the British chip design company Mr. Son bought in 2016 and recently went public.
The business structure behind the project remains unclear. Mr. Altman's company, OpenAI, is an A.I. research lab in San Francisco spanning roughly 400 researchers, engineers and support staff members, while Mr. Ive's San Francisco design firm, LoveFrom, has about three dozen industrial and software designers, as well as some engineers.
The talks have been going on for much of this year and were previously reported by The Information, a tech publication, and The Financial Times.
The partnership speaks to the way that generative A.I. is upending the status quo in Silicon Valley. Since the introduction of OpenAI's online chatbot, ChatGPT, late last year, companies have been scrambling to reinvent their businesses and tap into its power to answer questions, write emails, presentations and poetry, and even generate computer code.
Many tech executives believe the technology has the power to introduce a new paradigm in computing that they call "ambient computing." Rather than typing on smartphones and taking photographs, they imagine a future device in the form of something as simple as a pendant or glasses that can process the world in real time, using a sophisticated virtual assistant capable of fielding questions and processing images.
Mr. Altman had previously invested in a company pursuing that vision called Humane, which was founded by ex-Apple employees, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno. They plan to release their device, which they bill as a "disappearing computer," later this year.
One reason Mr. Altman may be determined to develop his own device is to avoid having OpenAI depend on Apple or Google's Android for distribution. Relying on other platforms has challenged tech giants, such as Facebook and Amazon, because Apple and Google take a cut of sales across their platform. Apple also has introduced privacy limits, which cut into advertising sales.
But the road to creating new hardware devices is littered with failure. Amazon and Facebook both tried to develop their own smartphones and abandoned their efforts after failing to gain traction.
Few in Silicon Valley have a better track record at developing devices than Mr. Ive. He was the driving force behind the company's development of the Apple Watch, the only major new device that the company has introduced since Steve Jobs's death in 2011. In 2019, Mr. Ive left the company to start LoveFrom, but he signed a multiyear contract to continue working with Apple.
Last year, Mr. Ive and Apple agreed to stop working together. In negotiating the end of their working relationship, Apple and Mr. Ive agreed that there would be no limits on the products that he could develop in the future, according to two people familiar with the matter.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Apple Executive Defends Deals Favoring Google: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eddy Cue, a longtime executive at the company, said Apple's multibillion-dollar deals with Google were driven by quality, not money.
Apple's top deal maker on Tuesday defended his company's favoritism of Google on iPhones, a pivotal collaboration that has shaped the modern tech industry and is at the center of a federal antitrust trial against the search giant.
Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, testified in Washington that Google's placement as the default search option on the Safari browser across Apple devices was motivated by quality.
"I didn't think at the time, or today, that there was anybody out there who is anywhere near as good as Google at searching," said Mr. Cue, who was called to testify by the Justice Department. "Certainly there wasn't a valid alternative."
The Justice Department has accused Google of illegally locking in its monopoly through deals to make its search option the default on Apple, Samsung, Firefox and other platforms. Those partnerships squashed competitors that struggled to get their products in front of consumers, the Justice Department argues.
The Justice Department and dozens of states that brought the lawsuit argue that Google used the default deals as a "powerful strategic weapon" to block competitors and lock in its dominance in the search market.
No other deal has been as significant to the government's case as a two-decades-long partnership between Google and Apple. The partnership has been worth $ 10 billion a year for Apple, which makes up more than 50 percent of the smartphone market in the United States, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm.
Mr. Cue's testimony has been highly anticipated. While the case is focused on Google, the Justice Department has viewed Apple as a secondary player and the foremost example of how Google has used its deep pockets to maintain its power over the global search market. Should the judge rule in the government's favor, it could cost Google and Apple billions of dollars.
The trial is the first monopolization case brought by the government in more than two decades, part of a crackdown on big tech by regulators appointed by President Biden. On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of illegally protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
The Justice Department is also suing Google for illegally monopolizing the ad tech market. And the F.T.C. is suing Meta for using its dominance in social media to kill off competition.
The U.S. government's case against Google promised to lift a veil off blockbuster deals between the most powerful global companies, giving the public a rare glimpse into business deals that have determined how consumers access information online.
Apple and Google began their partnership in search in 2002. In 2016, Mr. Cue took over renegotiations of the deal. The 30-plus-year Apple veteran had risen to be the company's top deal maker, overseeing agreements with record labels for Apple Music, banks for Apple Pay and Hollywood studios for Apple TV+.
In 2016, Mr. Cue met with Sundar Pichai, who was then a year into his role as Google's chief executive, to renegotiate for a higher percentage from their revenue-sharing arrangement.
Despite some back and forth on financial terms of a new deal, Mr. Cue said negotiations were never tested to the point that the companies would back down from their arrangement.
"It was in Google's best interest and our best interest to get the deal done," Mr. Cue said, adding that the company had never considered creating its own search engine to compete with Google.
"We provided great customers to Google -- they did an amazing job on the search engine side," he said.
The Justice Department disclosed in questioning that the deal in 2016 also included a provision for the companies to defend the agreement should it come under any regulatory challenges. Mr. Cue said that the provision was written in by lawyers for Apple and Google, and that he believed it pertained to an antitrust investigation in the European Union of Google.
But few other details were revealed in Mr. Cue's testimony. Much of the trial, which is expected to last until November, has been held in closed sessions and most exhibits have been sealed. Mr. Cue testified for about four hours, of which more than half was closed to the public.
Apple fought against the testimony of executives, saying that Mr. Cue and others had already been deposed ahead of the hearing and that business contracts under scrutiny were highly sensitive.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Friday morning just before 10, Steve Kellums, 54, and his son Keegan, 24, sat side by side in the older man's living room in Westland, Mich., a short drive from the Ford Motor assembly plant where they both work. One week into the strike by 3,300 workers at the plant, they were anxiously awaiting an announcement from their union president on Facebook Live.
Bent over his cellphone, Keegan tried to tamp down sparks of optimism. He knew better than to imagine that the strike, at that point limited to his plant and two others in Missouri and Ohio, would end quickly, because the United Automobile Workers and Ford management were so far apart.
"I know it's going to get more ugly before it gets better," Keegan said, taking a swig from a bottle of Pepsi.
Steve turned toward him. "Or, let's be positive," he said, sounding decidedly dad-like. "There's at least a chance they could have come to an agreement."
Father and son have leaned on one another since Sept. 15, when the autoworkers' union began its first simultaneous strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, Chrysler's parent company. Both men were on strike for the first time in their lives, and have been talking one another through it day by day. They represent two ends of the spectrum among the workers, and two perspectives on the industry, a generational divergence that ripples through the broader work force.
Their views reflect larger changes in the way younger people see work, and think about obligation to employers, a shift that has fed recent growth in support for unions and union organizing efforts at more private companies.
With 28 years behind him at Michigan Assembly -- an immense plant in Wayne, 30 miles west of Detroit, that ordinarily churns out some of Ford's most popular SUVs and trucks at slightly faster than one vehicle a minute -- Steve Kellums hopes to retire by the time he turns 60, and he dreams of buying a small farm in Tennessee. He was hired in 1994, before a downturn in the industry and a recession drove Ford into financial crisis, and forced the union to make once-unthinkable concessions, including accepting a two-tier wage system with lower pay for newer workers.
When Keegan Kellums started at Ford in 2020, his pay reflected those tumultuous changes. He said he left Amazon, where he was making nearly $ 18 an hour as a packager, to start at Ford at just $ 16 an hour.
His father said it pained him to see how much had changed since the days when a job at Ford Motor meant a comfortable middle-class life. He was making double his son's wages when Keegan was hired.
"Twenty-five years later, they only offered him $ 3 more per hour than I got when I joined," Steve said. "Is this the life I wanted for him? No."
Now, the U.A.W. is trying to eliminate two-tier wages, add retiree benefits for younger workers, and raise pay by 40 percent over the next four years, to make up for the compensation lost to givebacks over time. Ford has said it cannot afford those proposals.
On the picket line last week outside the plant in Wayne, it was hard to find a union member who did not have two or three generations of relatives employed by the company. For much of its history, since it began offering factory workers $ 5 a day to build the Model T in 1914, Ford's wages and benefits allowed blue-collar employees to join the middle class. Jobs with the automaker were sought after. Turnover was low.
Keegan has ties to Ford on both sides of his family. His maternal grandfather worked for 42 years at Michigan Assembly. His father's great-grandfather worked at another Ford plant in Dearborn. Keegan's first new car, in high school, was a silver Ford Fusion; to make his payments, he worked at the nearby Henry Ford museum.
As a boy, he imagined a future with Ford, but was taken aback when his father did not embrace his plan.
"My dad said, 'No, be something bigger than that, go to college -- I come home tired every day,"' the younger Mr. Kellums recalled another day last week, sitting in the local union hall near tables piled with food donated to striking workers.
When Keegan was nine or 10 and the country sank into recession, the union agreed to help keep Ford afloat through a bad time, but members now say Ford never restored their losses when profits surged again, leaving them disillusioned and less able to get by.
"I knew something was going on," Keegan said of that time in his childhood. "The big birthday parties got smaller. We stopped going to Cedar Point, the amusement park, for vacation every summer."
After high school, he worked as a cashier at Dollar Tree, making minimum wage and living at home, and then for Amazon, where he hoped to find more opportunity. But he found the workplace chaotic during the pandemic, with frequent changes in sick-time rules and people being fired with little warning.
When the job came up at Ford, he felt conflicted, but the prospect of joining a strong union made the difference.
"The union could protect me," he said. "That was it, right there."
The new job was a grueling adjustment for him -- physically demanding, hot and dirty. Lacking seniority, he worked from 6 p.m. until 4:30 a.m. and came home exhausted, his arms coated in black grime. Like his father, who works days, Keegan is a material handler, "feeding the line" by swiftly moving heavy rolling racks of auto parts from the warehouse to the fast-paced assembly floor.
"I'm a big boy," he said, "and it takes all my weight to move them."
As his endurance grew, so did his pay; earlier this month, his hourly wage rose to $ 24. He had saved enough by last November to move out of his father's house and into an apartment with two roommates.
When the call came to strike, father and son both said they felt ready. Steve took the bigger financial hit, because all union members are getting the same strike pay from the union -- $ 500 a week. But Keegan faces more uncertainty; he had planned to sign a lease on a new apartment this November, but now, with no idea how long the strike will last, he wonders if he should move back in with his dad.
If that is what it takes to win a better contract, so be it, he said, noting that for younger, lower-paid workers like him, the strike feels like less of a risk than it might for older workers.
"The difference with my generation is, we don't have a lot to lose," he said. "We don't have a pension. We don't have kids."
Each generation says it is fighting for the other: Keegan wants to see his father's losses restored, while Steve wants to know that his son will be able to make a decent living at Ford, as he himself once did, before cuts to his hours and overtime reduced his income. "I couldn't tell you the last time I had 40 hours," he said.
In his son's view of the future, though, Ford is just one option. "If I could find a good job somewhere else, I would," Keegan said, "but what else is there around here?"
The announcement the men were waiting for on Friday morning turned out not to be the strike's end, but its expansion. Workers at 38 General Motors and Stellantis parts distribution centers in 20 states were called to walk out. Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, did not expand the strike to additional Ford employees, though, citing progress in bargaining on job security and wages.
Encouraged by that glimmer of hope, Keegan said the strategy seemed sound, and that he approves of the union's aggressive approach. "The older generation, in general, has been more passive," he said. "I think my generation pushed them to take the first step."
Steve wonders how willing the younger workers will be to accept even reasonable compromises at the bargaining table.
To save money while the strike goes on, Keegan said he would continue to go "grocery shopping" in his father's pantry and visit often for home-cooked meals. At the union hall on Thursday, Keegan's girlfriend scooped up several donated tomatoes to give to his father, a skilled cook who can replicate their favorite Outback entree, Alice Springs Chicken.
After the announcement on Friday morning, it was time for Steve to head to the picket line, where he serves as a strike captain outside Gate 19 for six hours a week. Keegan tagged along, though his own assigned day to picket was not until Sunday. Keegan knew his dad would join the line again with him then.
Keegan's girlfriend has picketed as well, between her shifts at Walmart, where pay and benefits are lacking, she said, and there is no union to push for better. While the strike has made her more aware of the potential drawbacks of a job at Ford, the 22-year-old said it still looked like a better option.
Given the chance to work at Ford, she said, she would jump at it.

Wall Street Recoups Some Losses but Is on Pace for Ugly Month: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-recoups-some-losses-is-on-pace-ugly/docview/2868520946/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street clawed back some of its steep losses from last week, but September is still on track to be its worst month of the year despite Monday's gains.
The S&P 500 rose 17.38, or 0.4 percent, to 4,337.44, coming off its worst week in six months. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up by 43.04, or 0.1 percent, to 34,006.88, and the Nasdaq composite gained 59.51, or 0.5 percent, to 13,271.32.
Oil-related stocks led the way, as Exxon Mobil rose 1.1 percent and ConocoPhillips gained 1.6 percent. As a group, energy stocks in the S&P 500 climbed nearly twice as much as any of the other 11 sectors that make up the index.
While crude oil prices were mixed Monday, they've leaped sharply since the early summer.
Oil's jump has hurt Wall Street broadly, where the realization is sinking in that the Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates high well into next year. The Fed is trying to ensure high inflation gets back down to its target, and it said last week it will likely cut interest rates in 2024 by less than earlier expected. Its main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001.
The growing understanding that rates will stay higher for longer has pushed yields in the bond market up to their highest levels in more than a decade. That in turn makes investors less willing to pay high prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive or making their owners wait the longest for big growth.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.54 percent from 4.44 percent Friday and is near its highest level since 2007. That's up sharply from about 3.50 percent in May and from 0.50 percent about three years ago.
"Stocks digest gradual, growth driven increases in interest rates far better than rapid increases driven by other factors such as inflation or Fed policy," Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a report.
Higher yields are at the head of a long line of concerns weighing on Wall Street. Not only have oil prices jumped by $ 20 per barrel since June, economies around the world are looking shaky. The resumption of U.S. student-loan repayments may also weaken what's been the U.S. economy's greatest strength, spending by households.
In the near term, the U.S. government may be set for another shutdown amid more political squabbles on Capitol Hill. But Wall Street has managed its way through previous shutdowns, and "history shows that past ones haven't had much of an impact on the market," according to Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
On Wall Street, Amazon rose 1.7 percent and was the strongest single force pushing up on the S&P 500. The company announced an investment of up to $ 4 billion in Anthropic, as it takes a minority stake in the artificial intelligence start-up. It is the latest Big Tech company to pour money into A.I. in the race to profit from opportunities that the latest generation of the technology is set to fuel.
Stocks of media and entertainment companies were mixed after unionized screenwriters reached a tentative deal on Sunday to end their historic strike. No deal yet exists for striking actors.
Netflix rose 1.3 percent, while The Walt Disney Co. slipped 0.3 percent. Warner Brothers Discovery dropped 4 percent for the day's largest loss in the S&P 500.
Also on the losing end of Wall Street were stocks of travel-related companies, which slumped under the weight of worries about higher fuel costs. Southwest Airlines sank 2 percent, and Norwegian Cruise Line fell 3.1 percent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes slumped across Europe and much of Asia. France's CAC 40 fell 0.8 percent, and Germany's DAX lost 1 percent.
In China, troubled property developer China Evergrande sank nearly 22 percent after announcing it was unable to raise further debt because of an investigation into one of its affiliates.

Look Who's Talking Now: ChatGPT Finds Its Voice: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A new version of OpenAI's popular chatbot behaves a lot like Siri and Alexa. You can talk to it -- and have a conversation.
ChatGPT has learned to talk.
OpenAI, the San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up, released a version of its popular chatbot on Monday that can interact with people using spoken words. As with Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and other digital assistants, users can talk to ChatGPT and it will talk back.
For the first time, ChatGPT can also respond to images. People can, for example, upload a photo of the inside of their refrigerator, and the chatbot can give them a list of dishes they could cook with the ingredients they have.
"We're looking to make ChatGPT easier to use -- and more helpful," said Peter Deng, OpenAI's vice president of consumer and enterprise product.
OpenAI has accelerated the release of its A.I tools in recent weeks. This month, it unveiled a version of its DALL-E image generator and folded the tool into ChatGPT.
ChatGPT attracted hundreds of millions of users after it was introduced in November, and several other companies soon released similar services. With the new version of the bot, OpenAI is pushing beyond rival chatbots like Google Bard, while also competing with older technologies like Alexa and Siri.
Alexa and Siri have long provided ways of interacting with smartphones, laptops and other devices through spoken words. But chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard have more powerful language skills and are able to instantly write emails, poetry and term papers, and riff on almost any topic tossed their way.
OpenAI has essentially combined the two communication methods.
The company sees talking as a more natural way of interacting with its chatbot. It argues that ChatGPT's synthetic voices -- people can choose from five different options, including male and females voices -- are more convincing than others used with popular digital assistants.
Over the next two weeks, the company said, the new version of the chatbot would start rolling out to everyone who subscribes to ChatGPT Plus, a service that costs $ 20 a month. But the bot can respond with voice only when used on iPhones, iPads and Android devices.
The bot's synthetic voices are more natural than many others on the market, though they still can sound robotic. Like other digital assistants, it can struggle with homonyms. When The New York Times asked the new ChatGPT how to spell "gym," it said: "J-I-M."
But one of the advantages of a chatbot like ChatGPT is that it can correct itself. When told "No, the other kind of gym," the bot replied: "Ah, I see what you're referring to now. The place where people exercise and work out is spelled G-Y-M."
Though ChatGPT's voice interface is reminiscent of earlier assistants, the underlying technology is fundamentally different. ChatGPT is driven primarily by a large language model, or L.L.M., which has learned to generate language on the fly by analyzing huge amounts of text culled from across the internet.
Older digital assistants, like Alexa and Siri, acted like command-and-control centers that could perform a set number of tasks or give answers to a finite list of questions programmed into their databases, such as "Alexa, turn on the lights" or "What's the weather in Cupertino?" Adding new commands to the older assistants could take weeks. ChatGPT can respond authoritatively to virtually any question thrown at it in seconds -- though it is not always correct.
As OpenAI is transforming ChatGPT into something more like Alexa or Siri, companies like Amazon and Apple are transforming their digital assistants into something more like ChatGPT.
Last week, Amazon previewed an updated system for Alexa that aims for more fluid conversation about "any topic." It is driven in a part by a new L.L.M. and has other upgrades to pacing and intonation to make it sound more natural, the company said.
Apple, which has not publicly shared its plans for how it will compete with ChatGPT, has been testing a prototype of its large language model for future products, according to two people briefed on the project.
When used via the web as well as on iPhone, iPad and Android devices, the new ChatGPT can also respond to images. Given a photograph, chart or diagram, it can provide a detailed description of the image and answer questions about its contents. This could be a useful tool for people who are visually impaired.
OpenAI first demonstrated the image tool in the spring, but the company said it would not be shared with the public until researchers better understood how the technology could be misused. Among other concerns, they worried the tool could become a de facto face recognition service used to quickly identify people in photos.
Microsoft introduced this kind of visual search tool, based on OpenAI's technology, in its Bing chatbot over the summer.
Sandhini Agarwal, an OpenAI researcher who focuses on safety and policy, said the new version of the bot would now refuse efforts to identify faces. But it is designed to provide enormously detailed descriptions of other photos. Given an image from the Hubble Space Telescope, for example, it can respond with paragraphs detailing the contents in the photo.
The bot can also be a tool for students. Given an image of a high school math problem that includes words, numbers and diagrams, the bot can instantly read the problem and solve it. It could be an effective way to learn -- or cheat.
Photograph Over the next two weeks, OpenAI said, the new version of its chatbot would roll out to everyone who subscribes to ChatGPT Plus. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JACKIE MOLLOY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B3) This article appeared in print on page B1, B3.

Full text: I work in a bitingly cold office. Currently, I wear a charcoal fleece with a nice fit, but I can't help but feel the look is starting to feel tired. I would like to step up my jacket game but am unsure where to start. A down puffer looks like I'm making too much of a statement, whereas a suit jacket seems overly stiff. What would you advise?
Jessica, San Diego This is an issue not just for those of us who work in overly air-conditioned offices but for anyone dealing with the change in seasons and sudden nips in the air. Fleece is an easy solution and was, for a while, the favorite office uniform of shadow banker bros everywhere.
It was a way of advertising you had been to one of any number of elite conferences in the woods, be it Paul Allen's Sun Valley retreat or Davos. And it provided a direct visual contrast to the navy-suit establishment, suggesting that your hedge fund or private equity firm had a different, cooler set of values. And finally it was, well, practical.
I even knew one private equity titan who deliberately kept his office temperature frigid and always wore a fleece quarter-zip under his jacket, the better to put visitors, who were not expecting the chill, at a disadvantage. Such are the psychological sartorial games people play.
The problem is, when you get to that point, fleece at work becomes a cliche. At least if you are not in the outer rec world. So what to do instead?
Stellene Volandes, the editor of Town & Country, said she always keeps a scarf/shawl, like a pashmina, on the back of her chair just in case.
For those in search of another solution, I give you: the coatigan.
Another of my favorite hybrid garments, like the shacket, jorts and jeggings, the coatigan is a cross between a coat and a cardigan. It's long enough to wrap around the body and use almost as a blanket, and structured enough to pass muster in an office. Like a fleece, it's easy to pull on, so it doesn't telegraph "uptight suit," but unlike a fleece, it doesn't telegraph "hiking dude." And it is fungible enough to be slipped atop almost anything: dress, trousers, skirt, you name it.
Coatigans can be found at all price levels and a variety of retailers, from Amazon on up to the very haute. And given their versatility, it's worth investing in a simple style in a basic shade -- black or white or navy -- that you might keep for the long-term.

The A.I. Overlords Are Already Ruining the Internet: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Greg Marston, a British voice actor, recently came across "Connor" online -- an A.I.-generated clone of his voice, trained on a recording Mr. Marston had made in 2003. It was his voice uttering things he had never said.
Back then, he had recorded a session for IBM and later signed a release form allowing the recording to be used in many ways. Of course, at that time, Mr. Marston couldn't envision that IBM would use anything more than the exact utterances he had recorded. Thanks to artificial intelligence, however, IBM was able to sell Mr. Marston's decades-old sample to websites that are using it to build a synthetic voice that could say anything. Mr. Marston recently discovered his voice emanating from the Wimbledon website during the tennis tournament. (IBM said it is aware of Mr. Marston's concern and is discussing it with him directly.)
His plight illustrates why many of our economy's best-known creators are up in arms. We are in a time of eroding trust, as people realize that their contributions to a public space may be taken, monetized and potentially used to compete with them. When that erosion is complete, I worry that our digital public spaces might become even more polluted with untrustworthy content.
Already, artists are deleting their work from X, formerly known as Twitter, after the company said it would be using data from its platform to train its A.I. Hollywood writers and actors are on strike partly because they want to ensure their work is not fed into A.I. systems that companies could try to replace them with. News outlets including The New York Times and CNN have added files to their website to help prevent A.I. chatbots from scraping their content.
Authors are suing A.I. outfits, alleging that their books are included in the sites' training data. OpenAI has argued, in a separate proceeding, that the use of copyrighted data for training A.I. systems is legal under the "fair use" provision of copyright law.
While creators of quality content are contesting how their work is being used, dubious A.I.-generated content is stampeding into the public sphere. NewsGuard has identified 475 A.I.-generated news and information websites in 14 languages. A.I.-generated music is flooding streaming websites and generating A.I. royalties for scammers. A.I.-generated books -- including a mushroom foraging guide that could lead to mistakes in identifying highly poisonous fungi -- are so prevalent on Amazon that the company is asking authors who self-publish on its Kindle platform to also declare if they are using A.I.
This is a classic case of tragedy of the commons, where a common resource is harmed by the profit interests of individuals. The traditional example of this is a public field that cattle can graze upon. Without any limits, individual cattle owners have an incentive to overgraze the land, destroying its value to everybody.
We have commons on the internet, too. Despite all of its toxic corners, it is still full of vibrant portions that serve the public good -- places like Wikipedia and Reddit forums, where volunteers often share knowledge in good faith and work hard to keep bad actors at bay.
But these commons are now being overgrazed by rapacious tech companies that seek to feed all of the human wisdom, expertise, humor, anecdotes and advice they find in these places into their for-profit A.I. systems.
Consider, for instance, that the volunteers who build and maintain Wikipedia trusted that their work would be used according to the terms of their site, which requires attribution. Now some Wikipedians are apparently debating whether they have any legal recourse against chatbots that use their content without citing the source.
Regulators are trying to figure it out, too. The European Union is considering the first set of global restrictions on A.I., which would require some transparency from generative A.I. systems, including providing summaries of copyrighted data that was used to train its systems.
That would be a good step forward, since many A.I. systems do not fully disclose the data they were trained on. It has primarily been journalists who have dug up the murky data that lies beneath the glossy surface of the chatbots. A recent investigation detailed in The Atlantic revealed that more than 170,000 pirated books are included in the training data for Meta's A.I. chatbot, Llama. A Washington Post investigation revealed that OpenAI's ChatGPT relies on data scraped without consent from hundreds of thousands of websites.
But transparency is hardly enough to rebalance the power between those whose data is being exploited and the companies poised to cash in on the exploitation.
Tim Friedlander, founder and president of the National Association of Voice Actors, has called for A.I. companies to adopt ethical standards. He says that actors need three Cs: consent, control and compensation.
In fact, all of us need the three Cs. Whether we are professional actors or we just post pictures on social media, everyone should have the right to meaningful consent on whether we want our online lives fed into the giant A.I. machines.
And consent should not mean having to locate a bunch of hard-to-find opt-out buttons to click -- which is where the industry is heading.
Compensation is harder to figure out, especially since most of the A.I. bots are primarily free services at the moment. But make no mistake, the A.I. industry is planning to and will make money from these systems, and when it does, there will be a reckoning with those whose works fueled the profits.
For people like Mr. Marston, their livelihoods are at stake. He estimates that his A.I. clone has already lost him jobs and will cut into his future earnings significantly. He is working with a lawyer to seek compensation. "I never agreed or consented to having my voice cloned, to see/hear it released to the public, thus competing against myself," he told me.
But even those of us who don't have a job directly threatened by A.I. think of writing that novel or composing a song or recording a TikTok or making a joke on social media. If we don't have any protections from the A.I. data overgrazers, I worry that it will feel pointless to even try to create in public. And that would be a real tragedy.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Design and craft are, for the most part, completely foreign to me," says the Mexican actor and producer Gael García Bernal, 44. But when he encountered the work of the 39-year-old Mexico City-based ceramist Perla Valtierra, he felt an immediate connection. Combining a traditional Mexican aesthetic and materials with a Japanese-influenced perspective -- Valtierra lived and studied in Kyoto and counts the writings of Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Mingei folk-art movement, as a prime source of inspiration -- her pieces are known for their undulating accents and understated palettes. Improbably delicate loops of ribboned clay trace the edges of vases; graceful, swooping scallops circle the rims of plates and bowls. To García Bernal, the sinuous shapes conjure the spiraling plumes of the steam trains he was fascinated by as a child visiting relatives in northwestern Mexico. "What touches me most is not when I discover something but instead recognize it," he says. "That's what happened when I saw her work: I was very eager to meet her."
On an unusually hot morning in June, García Bernal arrived at Valtierra's showroom, tucked among other art spaces inside the Fundación Marso building, a grand 19th-century Porfirian-style house in Mexico City's Colonia Juárez. There, surrounded by glazed candlesticks, textured glass vases and earthenware vessels of various shapes and sizes, the two discovered they had more in common than just an appreciation for curves.
García Bernal, who started acting as a child, appears as the pioneering gay lucha libre wrestler Saúl Armendáriz in the biopic "Cassandro," which is currently in theaters and on Amazon Prime Video. Twenty or so years ago, with films like Alfonso Cuarón's "Y Tu Mamá También" (2001) and Alejandro González Iñárritu's "Amores Perros" (2000), he became the face of a Mexican cinema renaissance. Since then, he's collaborated with such filmmakers as Pedro Almodóvar, Michel Gondry and Walter Salles. The new film, directed and co-written by Roger Ross Williams, tells the story of Armendáriz's 1990 rise to stardom as an exótico, a male wrestler who dresses in drag and often taunts his straight opponents with flirtatious advances. Valtierra, who was raised in the northern state of Chihuahua and established her business 13 years ago after beginning her career as an industrial designer, is now, like García Bernal, finding herself in the unanticipated role of cultural ambassador, with her wares at the forefront of a contemporary Mexican design wave. Her line is not only used at many of the restaurants and boutiques that fill the city's Condesa and Roma neighborhoods but is also sold at influential interiors shops around the world, including Nickey Kehoe in Los Angeles, Roman and Williams Guild in New York and Ott in Seoul.
Despite these successes, both artists approach their art with a sense of naïveté. Even though Valtierra runs a brand that works with 15 artisans, she says she likes to think of herself as an "apprentice of ceramics." And García Bernal recently told the Spanish newspaper El País that, after more than 30 years in the business, he still feels like he could abandon filmmaking and do something else. Each has lived abroad -- Valtierra in Paris and Brussels, in addition to Kyoto, and García Bernal in Madrid and Buenos Aires, where he continues to reside part time -- and both returned home with changed perspectives regarding their country. As they sat down over coffee and Topo Chico water, weeks before the actors' strike began, they chatted about their creative processes, career motivations and what makes a work of art uniquely Mexican.
Gael García Bernal: I've noticed your work for a while now, and it takes me to a place of stillness, of contemplation -- to a state normally associated with Japan or the concept of Zen.
Perla Valtierra: Working in Japan made me see things about Mexico that I hadn't realized. We have many similarities in our craftsmanship. Like Japan, Mexico has a strong tradition of making useful but inspiring objects -- something that you drink water or coffee from, for example, but that also invites you to be in a certain mood.
T: With both of your work, you seem to address this question of what it is to be Mexican. What makes a craft Mexican? What does a Mexican character look like?
G.G.B.: Playing the character of Cassandro, it was about expressing this culture of the border, which is very particular, neither completely Mexican nor totally American. People there grow up with this tremendous wound [the border] right in front of them, and they have to ignore it every day. They have to reinvent themselves. What Cassandro did was take what was happening in Mexican wrestling -- the rise of the exóticos -- and add a more athletic and disciplined element from the United States [among other things] that made him stand out. It was a tremendous triumph of exoticism. Everybody wants to impose the idea that if you're from a certain place, you have to be a certain way; if you're from the border, you have to be culturally Tex-Mex. Cassandro managed to make a change. You lived abroad for a long time, didn't you, Perla?
P.V.: Yes, I lived in Europe for 10 years. I came back during the pandemic and realized I wanted to stay here.
G.G.B.: But you returned a little bit foreign, which is nice.
P.V.: Very much so. I think one of the most important things that changed is how I value the work that happens in Mexico. Now everything is made in China, and that's fine, but there are many things that can be done here.
G.G.B.: When I make a film, there's always this question of why we're doing what we're doing. When I started making movies here in Mexico, nobody went to see those movies, so we had to decide why we were making them anyway. What drove us was a hope that what we were making would reflect the truth about something. And that's how "Amores Perros" and "Y Tu Mamá También" came to be films that have endured -- though not as long as ceramics have endured.
P.V.: We make many pieces in series and produce a lot of them, so my work isn't art in the sense of it being one of a kind. But clay feels like a noble material, and I think that has to do with the historical origin of ceramics. Man became human when he started to sow seeds and store things and make these objects to hold water and use for cooking. So in that sense, the use of ceramic objects is fundamentally human. I work with a man named Jesús Torres, who makes the pieces on the wheel. His wife helps him a lot, and now his daughter is getting into wheel turning as well. There's this desire to return to these jobs rather than abandon them -- a sense that you can live well doing this work. For me, that's very important. I feel very fortunate to work with Don Jesús because he's very passionate and he loves to try new things, which isn't the case with everyone. When I have ideas, I go to the workshop, and he starts to work on the wheel. I tell him: "Thicker," "Smaller," "Close the wheel," "Open it." I don't just sketch and then come to pick up my stuff.
G.G.B.: That's just the way films have to be made. You have to spend time and then see how it turns out. Sometimes film editing is like doing an engineer's job, putting the pieces together and saying, "Oh, look, if I move this here, that's much better."
T: What are you both hoping to do next?
P.V.: I would love to work with trade schools so we can eventually work in a more local way. I would also love to spend less time on organization and production, and more time going to other workshops [around Mexico] and meeting people with whom I can collaborate.
G.G.B.: I'm realizing that many things I've wanted to do come from my desire to be part of a community because, unfortunately, what capitalism defines as success calls for something like desolation, in a way, and that doesn't allow for a very important part of the creative process: the cycle of decomposition and growing into other things. I believe that only happens in community -- in the Mexican way of thinking, the collective is more important than the individual, [so] this [country] is a good place to be able to work that way. I insist on it: "Let's talk, let's share, let's be open about what we liked and didn't like about projects we've done."
T: How do you find joy outside of your work?
P.V.: I love to dance. I can dance to anything. I went to Chihuahua a week ago to see [the Sinaloan group] Banda El Recodo in concert with [the singer] Julio Preciado. In the city, I dance when I can, but there aren't so many places to dance anymore.
G.G.B.: I love dancing, too. I have my places that nobody knows about. But I have one more question for you: Have you ever used the Japanese technique of mending ceramics with gold or silver [powder]? I find it amazing how these broken things can have a new life, can become something else.
P.V.: Something more beautiful! Yes, I studied kintsugi when I was in Japan. I love it but it takes a lot of time, so I don't do it much now. But I still gather broken pieces and save them for the day when I'll have time to sit down at the table and work on kintsugi.
G.G.B.: That's a good place to end, I think, with the idea of one thing becoming something else.
P.V.: Yes -- transformation.

Big 3 Strike Offers Tesla Opportunity And Pitfalls: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, may be able to exploit his rivals' weaknesses, but the United Automobile Workers union also has the electric carmaker in its sights.
The United Automobile Workers strike against the Michigan automakers would seem to be nothing but good news for Tesla, the electric vehicle maker that has upended the industry and stolen customers from Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Ram.
Unencumbered by an activist union, Tesla can take advantage of the work stoppages to add to its substantial lead in battery technology and software. As the three established automakers face increases in labor costs and struggle to master electric vehicles, Tesla can twist the knife by lowering car prices because it is much more profitable than most automakers.
But the U.A.W.'s determination to secure a big victory for its members, amid a nationwide resurgence in union activism, harbors risks for Tesla and Elon Musk, its chief executive, who has attacked and ridiculed unions on his social media network, X, formerly Twitter.
The U.A.W., which has failed to organize Tesla's factory workers in the past, is gearing up for another attempt, a top union official said.
"There is a group of Tesla workers who are actively talking about forming a union and creating the best representation they can for themselves and their co-workers through collective bargaining," said Mike Miller, the director of the U.A.W.'s Region 6, which includes California and Nevada, where Tesla makes cars and batteries. Tesla also has a large factory in Austin, Texas, not too far from a unionized G.M. factory in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
In an interview, Mr. Miller declined to provide more details or identify the Tesla workers, saying they needed time to prepare before going public. This union organizing effort is separate from a campaign at a Buffalo plant where Tesla makes electric vehicle chargers and employs data entry workers.
But as representatives of the national union demand 40 percent wage increases from the Detroit automakers, along with significant gains in benefits, they are certainly thinking about the signal that any deal would send to nonunion workers at Tesla.
"Clearly the narrative out there is that this can't be good for the Big Three, and if it's not good for the Big Three, it's good for Tesla," said Rahul Kapoor, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
But he added, "If I'm an autoworker with wages lower than what Ford and G.M. are paying, and I hear there is a substantial increase, it's very likely I would want to take that into account."
The president of the U.A.W., Shawn Fain, fired a warning shot at Mr. Musk Sunday on CBS News's "Face the Nation."
"Most of these workers in those companies are scraping to get by so that greedy C.E.O.s and greedy people like Elon Musk can build more rocket ships and shoot theirself in outer space," he said.
A lot has changed since 2016, when a group of workers at Tesla's auto assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., began an organizing drive that never acquired enough momentum to come to a vote.
Back then, Tesla was a struggling upstart flirting with bankruptcy. Now, Tesla dominates the market for electric vehicles, with a 60 percent share in the United States. It is worth vastly more on the stock market than the three established U.S. automakers combined. It is arguably in a better position to reward workers than its rivals.
Yet labor organizing is arduous. Activists must get at least 30 percent of workers to sign union cards and force a vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. Companies often do all they can to dissuade workers from joining, hiring lawyers and consultants who specialize in defeating union campaigns.
Even if a majority of workers cast ballots in favor of a union, winning pay increases and better benefits comes only after negotiations that can drag for years. Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse voted in April 2022 to unionize, but Amazon has challenged the result and has yet to begin bargaining on a contract.
Still, Tesla would be a tempting target for unions. The company reported profit of $ 2.7 billion on sales of $ 25 billion in the second quarter, giving it a profit margin of about 11 percent. That profit margin is more than that of Ford or G.M., even after an exceptionally profitable period for those companies. Stellantis, which was created by the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, reported an 11 percent profit margin in the first six months of the year, but lost market share in the United States.
Tesla's stronger financial performance has allowed it to significantly cut car prices, making it harder for the established carmakers to gain ground in electric vehicles. The least expensive Model 3 sedan costs about $ 33,000 after federal tax credits, less than comparable gasoline vehicles.
The climate for organized labor is better than it has been for years. President Biden is a big supporter of unions. Hollywood writers and actors are on strike, a high-profile manifestation of labor activism. In August, United Parcel Service employees won their biggest raises ever in a contract negotiated by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Musk seemed to acknowledge the union threat last week, saying on X that his workers were better off than employees of G.M., Ford and Stellantis. "We pay more than the U.A.W.," he said, although he added that "performance expectations are also higher."
The traditional automakers quarreled with Mr. Musk's math, saying that they pay their workers substantially more and that a big raise would only widen the gap and undermine their ability to invest in electric vehicle and battery factories. Ford says its hourly employees make an average of $ 112,000 per year including benefits, compared with about $ 90,000 at Tesla.
The Ford figures do not include stock options that Tesla grants employees, and that can be worth a lot. Mr. Musk has said that some production workers have become millionaires from their shares in the company.
Stock options can be lucrative but also risky. Tesla has not detailed how often or in what amount it distributes options to rank-and-file workers. In regulatory filings, the company has said the options that those workers receive have a vesting period, meaning that employees must remain at the company for a certain period to cash them in.
Tesla workers may lose their options if they are fired or forced to quit because of injury or poor health, said Bryan Schwartz, a lawyer in Oakland, Calif., who has represented the company's employees in lawsuits against the company.
"There are lots of issues with options to the degree workers can really count on them," Mr. Schwartz said.
Stock awards fluctuate in value along with Tesla's share price. The stock peaked at more than $ 400 in late 2021, plummeted to a little more than $ 100 last year and rebounded this year to $ 270. The uncertainty may be unsettling for workers trying to make mortgage payments and pay for child care.
"If I was a Tesla worker, with all these other companies making E.V.s, I would prefer a wage," said Rick Eckstein, a professor of sociology at Villanova University who follows labor issues.
Tesla has a reputation as a tough place to work, with long hours and punishing deadlines. Mr. Schwartz has sued Tesla on behalf of Black employees who say they faced discrimination in promotions and work assignments and were subject to racist abuse. Tesla has denied the accusations.
Any union drive would face forceful opposition from Mr. Musk. The National Labor Relations Board has found that Mr. Musk illegally threatened employees in 2018 by implying they would lose their stock options if they voted to unionize. The labor board also found that Tesla illegally fired one of the lead organizers.
An appeals court upheld the board's decision. Tesla, which argues that Mr. Musk and the company did nothing wrong, is appealing the court ruling.
Without doubt, the strike poses huge risks for the Detroit automakers, which were slow to take Tesla seriously and stand to lose precious time they need to catch up.
"The real winner in the U.A.W. strike will likely be the auto company that has been winning all along," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm that owns Tesla stock, said on X.
But any schadenfreude among Tesla investors could be brief.
"The strike could be a bellwether," said Mr. Eckstein of Villanova. "It's a hot time in the labor movement."

With Interest Rates High, Wall Street Continues to Fall: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/with-interest-rates-high-wall-street-continues/docview/2867005607/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street fell sharply Thursday in an ugly day for stocks worldwide on expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay high well into next year.
The S&P 500 lost 1.6 percent for its worst day since March. That followed a drop of 0.9 percent from Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it may cut interest rates next year by just half of what it had earlier predicted. The Fed has already raised its main interest rate to levels unseen since 2001, which helps slow inflation, but at the cost of hurting investment prices.
High-growth stocks are typically among the hardest hit by high rates, and Big Tech stocks took the brunt of the pain for a second straight day. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.8 percent as Amazon fell 4.4 percent, Nvidia dropped 2.9 percent and Telsa lost 2.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.1 percent.
Stock prices tend to fall when rates rise because stocks are riskier investments. Why stomach the chance of their big swings when Treasurys are paying more in interest than before? And they're paying much more.
A 10-year Treasury is offering a yield of 4.48 percent, up from 4.40 percent late Wednesday and from only 0.50 percent three years ago. It's near its highest level since 2007.
The two-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, wavered after some mixed reports on the economy. It slipped to 5.14 percent from 5.17 percent late Wednesday after climbing earlier in the morning.
One report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. It was the lowest number since January and the latest signal of a remarkably resilient job market.
Such a solid labor market helps calm worries about a possible recession. But it may also give U.S. households fuel to keep spending, which could encourage companies to try to raise prices further and keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could give the Fed more reason to keep rates higher for longer.
A separate report, meanwhile, suggested manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is contracting by much more than economists expected. A third report showed sales of previously occupied U.S. homes were weaker last month than economists expected.
Manufacturing and the housing industry have felt the sting of higher interest rates in particular and have struggled more than the broad job market.
Interest rates may stay high if the Federal Reserve follows through on the latest forecasts from its policymaking officials.
Policymakers have indicated they could raise the federal funds rate one more time this year, then cut it by only half a percentage point from there through 2024. Three months ago, Fed officials were forecasting a full percentage point of cuts could be the most likely path. They want to ensure that inflation gets back down to the Fed's target of 2 percent.
Wednesday's projections may be an indication that "raises the bar for rate cuts next year," according to the Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. He pushed out his forecast for the first cut in interest rates to the final three months of 2024 after earlier thinking it could happen during the spring.
High rates slow the economy by design and raise the pressure across the financial world. Earlier this spring, they helped lead to three high-profile collapses of U.S. banks. They also hurt prices for all kinds of investments. The hardest hit tend to be those bid up on hopes for big growth far out in the future. That's why tech stocks often swing in particular with expectations for rates.
Cisco Systems also took a hit after it said it would buy Splunk, a cybersecurity company, for roughly $ 28 billion in cash. Cisco fell 3.9%, while Splunk jumped 20.8%.
On the winning side of Wall Street, FedEx rose 4.5% after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

The United Auto Workers strike against the Michigan automakers would seem to be nothing but good news for Tesla, the electric vehicle maker that has upended the industry and stolen customers from Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Ram.
Unencumbered by an activist union, Tesla can take advantage of the work stoppages to add to its substantial lead in battery technology and software. As the three established automakers face increases in labor costs and struggle to master electric vehicles, Tesla can twist the knife by lowering car prices because it is much more profitable than most automakers.
But the UAW’s determination to secure a big victory for its members, amid a nationwide resurgence in union activism, harbors risks for Tesla and Elon Musk, its CEO, who has attacked and ridiculed unions on his social media network, X, formerly Twitter.
The UAW, which has failed to organize Tesla’s factory workers in the past, is gearing up for another attempt, a top union official said.
“There is a group of Tesla workers who are actively talking about forming a union and creating the best representation they can for themselves and their co-workers through collective bargaining,” said Mike Miller, the director of the UAW’s Region 6, which includes California and Nevada, where Tesla makes cars and batteries. Tesla also has a large factory in Austin, Texas, not too far from a unionized GM factory in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
In an interview, Miller declined to provide more details or identify the Tesla workers, saying they needed time to prepare before going public. This union-organizing effort is separate from a campaign at a Buffalo, New York, plant where Tesla makes electric vehicle chargers and employs data entry workers.
But as representatives of the national union demand 40% wage increases from the Detroit automakers, along with significant gains in benefits, they are certainly thinking about the signal that any deal would send to nonunion workers at Tesla.
“Clearly, the narrative out there is that this can’t be good for the Big Three, and if it’s not good for the Big Three, it’s good for Tesla,” said Rahul Kapoor, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
But, he added, “If I’m an autoworker with wages lower than what Ford and GM are paying, and I hear there is a substantial increase, it’s very likely I would want to take that into account.”
The president of the UAW, Shawn Fain, fired a warning shot at Musk on Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”
“Most of these workers in those companies are scraping to get by so that greedy CEOs and greedy people like Elon Musk can build more rocket ships and shoot theirself in outer space,” he said.
A lot has changed since 2016, when a group of workers at Tesla’s auto assembly plant in Fremont, California, began an organizing drive that never acquired enough momentum to come to a vote.
Back then, Tesla was a struggling upstart flirting with bankruptcy. Now Tesla dominates the market for electric vehicles, with a 60% share in the United States. It is worth vastly more on the stock market than the three established U.S. automakers combined. It is arguably in a better position to reward workers than its rivals.
Yet labor organizing is arduous. Activists must get at least 30% of workers to sign union cards and force a vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. Companies often do all they can to dissuade workers from joining, hiring lawyers and consultants who specialize in defeating union campaigns.
Even if a majority of workers cast ballots in favor of a union, winning pay increases and better benefits comes only after negotiations that can drag for years. Amazon workers at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse voted in April 2022 to unionize, but Amazon has challenged the result and has yet to begin bargaining on a contract.
Still, Tesla would be a tempting target for unions. The company reported profit of $2.7 billion on sales of $25 billion in the second quarter, giving it a profit margin of about 11%. That profit margin is more than that of Ford or GM, even after an exceptionally profitable period for those companies. Stellantis, which was created by the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, reported an 11% profit margin in the first six months of the year but lost market share in the United States.
Tesla’s stronger financial performance has allowed it to significantly cut car prices, making it harder for the established carmakers to gain ground in electric vehicles. The least expensive Model 3 sedan costs about $33,000 after federal tax credits, less than comparable gasoline vehicles.
The climate for organized labor is better than it has been for years. President Joe Biden is a big supporter of unions. Hollywood writers and actors are on strike, a high-profile manifestation of labor activism. In August, UPS employees won their biggest raises ever in a contract negotiated by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk seemed to acknowledge the union threat last week, saying on X that his workers were better off than employees of GM, Ford and Stellantis. “We pay more than the UAW,” he said, although he added that “performance expectations are also higher.”
The traditional automakers quarreled with Musk’s math, saying that they pay their workers substantially more and that a big raise would only widen the gap and undermine their ability to invest in electric vehicle and battery factories. Ford says its hourly employees make an average of $112,000 per year including benefits, compared with about $90,000 at Tesla.
The Ford figures do not include stock options that Tesla grants employees, and that can be worth a lot. Musk has said that some production workers have become millionaires from their shares in the company.
Stock options can be lucrative but also risky. Tesla has not detailed how often or in what amount it distributes options to rank-and-file workers. In regulatory filings, the company has said the options those workers receive have a vesting period, meaning that employees must remain at the company for a certain period to cash them in.
Tesla workers may lose their options if they are fired or forced to quit because of injury or poor health, said Bryan Schwartz, a lawyer in Oakland, California, who has represented the company’s employees in lawsuits against the company.
“There are lots of issues with options to the degree workers can really count on them,” Schwartz said.
Stock awards fluctuate in value along with Tesla’s share price. The stock peaked at more than $400 in late 2021, plummeted to a little more than $100 last year and rebounded this year to $270. The uncertainty may be unsettling for workers trying to make mortgage payments and pay for child care.
“If I was a Tesla worker, with all these other companies making EV’s, I would prefer a wage,” said Rick Eckstein, a professor of sociology at Villanova University who follows labor issues.
Tesla has a reputation as a tough place to work, with long hours and punishing deadlines. Schwartz has sued Tesla on behalf of Black employees who say they faced discrimination in promotions and work assignments and were subject to racist abuse. Tesla has denied the accusations.
Any union drive would face forceful opposition from Musk. The National Labor Relations Board has found that Musk illegally threatened employees in 2018 by implying they would lose their stock options if they voted to unionize. The labor board also found that Tesla illegally fired one of the lead organizers.
An appeals court upheld the board’s decision. Tesla, which argues that Musk and the company did nothing wrong, is appealing the court ruling.
Without doubt, the strike poses huge risks for the Detroit automakers, which were slow to take Tesla seriously and stand to lose precious time they need to catch up.
“The real winner in the UAW strike will likely be the auto company that has been winning all along,” Gary Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, an investment firm that owns Tesla stock, said on X.
But any schadenfreude among Tesla investors could be brief.
“The strike could be a bellwether,” said Eckstein. “It’s a hot time in the labor movement.”

That N.C. Wyeth Will Look Very Nice in My Bedroom: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A woman found a rare N.C. Wyeth illustration while rummaging through frames at a Savers in New Hampshire.
You can walk out of the Savers in Manchester, N.H., with a shirt for as little as $ 4.99. There are $ 2 rings for those interested in costume jewelry. Framed artworks too big for shelves lean invitingly against one of the walls.
The thrift store's manager says that shopping there is like a personal treasure hunt, which was certainly the case for one woman who made the find of a lifetime in 2017.
While pushing a metal cart through the Savers on a hunt for home décor, she spotted a dusty painting with a substantial wooden frame amid a stack of posters and prints. Two women in the image appeared to be in a standoff, the elder displaying stern disapproval.
The shopper was taken by the painting -- Who were the women? Why did they seem so tense? -- and clunked it into her cart. Minutes later, she was wheeling out an authentic oil panel by N.C. Wyeth, one of the premier American illustrators of the 20th century, known for bringing to life classic stories like "Treasure Island," "Robin Hood" and "Robinson Crusoe."
Her bill for the long-lost work, which sold at auction on Tuesday for $ 191,000 including fees? Four dollars.
"We look at all the donations we receive and we place a value on them as best we can," said the Savers manager, Shaun Edson. "We are not connoisseurs of paintings. We do our best to evaluate the pieces and value them appropriately."
"I wasn't with the company in 2017," he added. "Obviously we missed the boat."
The painting's owner recalled the sequence of events in a telephone interview with The New York Times and was granted anonymity because she is becoming much richer from the sale of a painting that has drawn considerable attention.
After purchasing the piece, the buyer hung it in her bedroom before eventually casting it aside into a closet with school pictures and other items. When she rediscovered the work in May and noticed a signed label on the back, she decided to post some images of it on Facebook.
Lauren Lewis, an art conservator, was among those who reached out after seeing the painting on social media. Eventually, the owner said, she and her husband wrapped the painting in a blanket, loaded it into the back of their S.U.V. and drove about 90 minutes to meet Lewis in the parking lot of a bus terminal.
Wielding a magnifying glass, Lewis became excited and spoke about aspects of the work the owner had never considered, such as its brushstrokes.
So the couple scrapped their plans to stop for lunch, instead driving straight home to rehang the painting. This time, the owner's husband placed pillows on the floor beneath it.
"How is this possible?" Lewis said she had been asking herself since she first saw the Wyeth on Facebook. "It's all very fortuitous. This has all come together in a lovely way."
The frontispiece illustration that is now being auctioned was part of a four-image set that Wyeth contributed for a 1939 edition of Helen Hunt Jackson's novel "Ramona," which revolves around an orphan living in Southern California after the Mexican-American War. The illustration, also called "Ramona," portrays the tension between the young woman and her foster mother, according to catalog notes provided by the auction house Bonhams Skinner, which also say Wyeth was known for his "vivid colors and a skillful use of light and shadow."
Wyeth's work is featured at the Brandywine Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa., and he is part of one of the most prominent artistic families in the United States. The Museum of Modern Art owns the painting "Christina's World" by Andrew Wyeth, one of N.C. Wyeth's five children.
Experts say "Ramona" was probably a gift from book publishers to an editor or to the estate of the author. But exactly how it wound up at the Savers in Manchester is unclear.
Good things like the thrift store find, the painting's owner said, do not often happen to people like her and her husband. They have begun to allow themselves to think about the bills they can pay, and a vacation to Germany to visit one of their children.
Aware that she will soon part ways with the painting, its owner bought a copy of the 1939 version of "Ramona" on Amazon. Although she is a bibliophile, she plans to rip out Wyeth's illustration of the two women and frame it.

Amazon to Hire 250,000
For the Holiday Season
Amazon said on Tuesday that it will hire 250,000 full- and part-time workers for the holiday season, a 67 percent jump compared with last year.
Target announced separately that it would nearly 100,000 seasonal roles during the holidays, the same amount as it did last year.
Amazon said more jobs were available because the company has opened over 50 new fulfillment centers, delivery stations and same-day delivery sites in the United States this year.
The e-commerce giant also wrote in a blog post that it would invest $ 1.3 billion this year toward pay increases for warehouse and transportation employees, raising the average pay for those roles from $ 19 to over $ 20.50 per hour.
The accounting firm Deloitte said in a report last week that it expected holiday sales to jump between 3.5 percent to 4.6 percent. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Global Debt Hits Record
As Debt Ratios Increase
Global debt reached a record $ 307 trillion in the second quarter despite rising interest rates curbing bank credit, with markets such as the United States and Japan driving the rise, the Institute of International Finance said on Tuesday.
The financial services trade group's report said global debt in dollar terms had risen by $ 10 trillion in the first half of 2023 and by $ 100 trillion over the last decade.
The latest increase has lifted the global debt-to-G.D.P. ratio for a second straight quarter, to 336 percent. A slowdown in growth, and a deceleration in price increases, have caused nominal gross domestic product to expand less slowly than debt levels and were behind the debt ratio rise, the report said.
Rising levels of debt can force countries, corporations and households to tighten their belts and rein in spending and investments, in turn crimping growth and living standards. REUTERS

Canadian Inflation Jumps,
And Rate Rise May Follow
Canada's annual inflation rate in August jumped to 4.0 percent from 3.3 percent in July on higher gasoline prices, data showed on Tuesday, a sign the central bank may be forced to raise interest rates yet again after 10 increases since March 2022.
Analysts had forecast that inflation would hit 3.8 percent. The consumer price index rose 0.4 percent on a month-over-month basis in August, Statistics Canada said, compared with a predicted 0.3 percent gain. Two of the three core inflation measures also rose.
The annual rate, the highest since the 4.4 percent reported in April, is double the Bank of Canada's 2 percent target. The main driver was a 0.8 percent year-on-year increase in gasoline prices, which had dropped 12.9 percent in the 12 months to July.
Money markets raised bets for a rate hike in October, seeing a 42 percent chance of an increase after the price figures compared with 23 percent before. REUTERS

Max to Stream Live Sports At No Extra Cost, for Now: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Media companies are racing to figure out how to merge live sporting events with their popular but still cash-bleeding streaming services.
Sports continues to make its march to streaming.
Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Tuesday that it would begin adding live sporting events from the company's cable networks to the Max streaming service in October. The streaming service will now include access to Major League Baseball playoff games, as well as regular-season games from the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.
For several months, the sporting events will be free for all Max subscribers. But in late February -- just as college basketball's March Madness is about to get underway, and several weeks before professional basketball and hockey playoffs begin -- access to the games will cost $ 10 a month on top of the standard Max subscription price, the company said. Currently, Max without commercials costs $ 16 a month, and the advertising-supported plan is $ 10 a month.
Media companies are racing to figure out how to fold in live sporting events with their popular but still cash-bleeding streaming services. The rights to the sporting events are often expensive, and are one of the last main drivers to broadcast and cable channels. (Warner Bros. Discovery carries live sports on its Turner cable networks.)
Recently, Charter Communications subscribers temporarily lost access to Disney's cable networks, including ESPN, in a highly publicized dispute. Charter executives argued that Disney sought too much additional money for its cable networks even though its priority was its streaming business.
Disney has signaled that ESPN will, at some point, be available to customers via streaming without a cable subscription. The dispute with Charter was settled this month.
Other media companies are providing access to marquee sporting events on their streaming services at no additional charge. Paramount offers football games through its streaming service, Paramount+. Peacock will stream a wild-card N.F.L. playoff game early next year that will not be available on a cable or broadcast network. Amazon likewise has rights to "Thursday Night Football" at no additional charge to Prime Video.
That's an approach that Warner Bros. Discovery "fundamentally disagrees" with, said JB Perrette, the president of the company's streaming division.
"Our goal with selling it as an incremental tier is a belief that it's too valuable -- it's something that has to have a separate charge," he said in an interview.
"Our belief is we've got to set up models that are viable for the long term," he added.
Sports rights are expected to get more expensive, and the rights to N.B.A. games -- including those now controlled by Warner Bros. Discovery -- will be up for grabs in the next two years. Luis Silberwasser, the chairman of the company's sports division, said the leap to streaming would be appealing to both professional leagues and advertisers.
"For our clients, for our advertisers and also for the leagues, they want reach," he said. "They want to be able to reach the younger consumer."
The sports tier will be branded as the Bleacher Report Sports Add-On. (Bleacher Report, a sports website, is owned by the company.) It will debut on Oct. 5.
The change is part of a broader effort to try to lure new subscribers with live sports and news. Max currently has 95.8 million subscribers, fewer than Netflix and Disney+.
Max will also add the so-called CNN Max channel next week, which will include at least three flagship shows -- ones hosted by Jake Tapper, Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper -- live from the cable news network.

Macy's Is Gearing Up For Holiday Season
Macy's said on Monday that it would hire more than 38,000 full- and part-time workers for the holiday season -- fewer than last year -- as the department store gears up for the busy shopping period.
A report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas last week revealed U.S. retailers would hire the lowest number of seasonal workers this year since 2008. Planned holiday hires announced so far were much lower than in 2022, it said.
U.S. holiday sales this year are expected to grow at their slowest pace in five years, as consumers spend cautiously due to shrinking household savings and lingering worries over the economy.
Macy's said last year that it would recruit about 41,000 employees, and in 2021 it announced that it would take on around 76,000 workers.
Macy's is looking to hire for its three banners, Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores, as well as its distribution centers. REUTERS

Penguin Random House Gets New C.E.O.
Nihar Malaviya has been named as permanent CEO of Penguin Random House, nine months after he was appointed the interim chief executive.
Malaviya succeeded Markus Dohle, who departed weeks after a federal judge struck down Penguin Random House's attempted merger with Simon & Schuster, a deal Dohle had pushed for. Penguin Random House, the world's largest trade publisher, has been undergoing a company-wide reorganization in 2023, with numerous senior editors either laid off or departing under a voluntary retirement plan.
Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, has owned Random House since 1998.
Malaviya, 48, joined Bertelsmann in 2001, and had served in a variety of positions before becoming CEO. He was most recently COO and president of Penguin Random House in the U.S. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Microsoft's Product Chief Is Leaving for Amazon
Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi, who oversees its consumer marketing efforts, is taking over the firm's Surface and Windows businesses with the external PC makers and retail partners, as longtime product chief Panos Panay steps down.
Panay stepped down after nearly 20 years with Microsoft, where he helmed the creation of the Surface line of computers and more recently oversaw the launch of the Windows 11 operating system.
In a statement, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, thanked Panay for his "impact on our products, culture, company, and industry over the past two decades."
"I'm grateful for your leadership, support and all you've done for Microsoft and our customers and partners," Nadella continued.
Microsoft also said Pavan Davuluri will lead a hardware engineering team that includes Microsoft's efforts to develop its own chips, according to a staff email on Monday by Rajesh Jha. REUTERS

Full text: Casey Wasserman had long pledged to stay away from the traditional entertainment business, but he said a new media landscape changed his thinking.
For decades, Casey Wasserman has insisted that he would never enter the traditional entertainment business. Film and TV felt too incestuous -- his grandfather Lew Wasserman reigned as Hollywood's power broker from the 1960s to the 1990s -- and too financially challenged, he would say.
Never say never: Mr. Wasserman, 49, announced on Monday that his sports-centered conglomerate, Wasserman, had completed a deal to buy Brillstein Entertainment Partners, a Hollywood management firm and content production company. Terms were not disclosed.
Brillstein represents stars like Brad Pitt, Tiffany Haddish, Adam Sandler, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Elizabeth Olsen. The firm also represents digital creators, podcasters and professional video game players. Brillstein, which landed a major hit in 1999 with "The Sopranos" and has a hand in "Real Time With Bill Maher," recently signed a first-look deal with Paramount Television Studios and has projects in the works at Netflix, Disney and Amazon.
What changed Mr. Wasserman's mind?
"The media business is radically different than it was even five years ago, and that frankly requires us to think differently about how we represent sports and music talent," he said. "Musicians are on TikTok and athletes are on YouTube and people want to produce documentaries. The lines have blurred a lot more than I think anyone would have expected even five years ago."
He continued, "Athletes used to monetize themselves in sports, musicians in music, entertainment in entertainment space, and those lines are gone."
Wasserman, founded in 2002 as the Wasserman Media Group, has become one of the largest sports representation and marketing agencies in the world. After a failed expansion into the management of musicians in the early 2000s, Wasserman tried again in recent years and now has a large music division, representing artists and bands like Billie Eilish, Brandi Carlile, Drake and Coldplay.
Mr. Wasserman said he intended to expand Brillstein's television and film production business, perhaps by acquiring additional film and television companies. "We want to get this first step right," he said. "But this is a first step, not a last step."
Brillstein was founded in 1969 by Bernie Brillstein, a garrulous talent manager who died in 2008. With early clients like Lorne Michaels and Jim Henson, Mr. Brillstein built his firm into one of Hollywood's leading management companies. His business model -- managing stars and helping to produce television shows and movies for them -- attracted competitors, some of which (Anonymous Content, 3 Arts Entertainment) would eventually surpass Brillstein in size.
Jon Liebman, Brillstein's co-chief executive, said that Wasserman would provide the resources needed to expand, particularly in content production. "The business has become incredibly complex," Mr. Liebman said. "The days when a manager could effectively serve clients without being plugged into a larger organization are over."

U.S. Strikes Are Felt in U.K.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many U.S. studios' blockbusters are filmed in Britain, so the walkouts by actors and screenwriters have caused thousands of U.K. film crews to lose work.
What do "Barbie," "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning" and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" have in common? Besides being the summer's big-budget movies, they were made in Britain, filmed in part at some of the country's most esteemed studios.
Big Hollywood productions are a critical part of Britain's film and television industry. For years, they have brought in money, jobs and prestige, and helped make the sector a bright spot in Britain's economy. But now, that special relationship has brought difficulty.
The strikes by actors and screenwriters in the United States, which have ground much of Hollywood to a standstill, are also being strongly felt in Britain, where productions including "Deadpool 3," "Wicked" and Part 2 of "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning" stopped filming. Throughout the late summer months, when the industry would be at its busiest to take advantage of the long days, soundstages at Pinewood, Britain's largest studios, were instead nearly empty.
Film crews, like camera workers and costume designers, are out of work after productions abruptly stopped. Bectu, the British union for workers in behind-the-scenes roles in creative industries, surveyed nearly 4,000 of its film and TV members and 80 percent said their jobs had been affected, with three-quarters not working.
"Irrespective of whether you think the studios are right or whether the unions are right, there are people who are suffering in the U.K.," said Marcus Ryder, the incoming chief executive of the Film and TV Charity, which supports workers who are struggling financially.
In August, the charity received more than 320 applications for hardship grants, compared with 37 a year earlier.
Since the first "Star Wars" movie was filmed partly in a studio in England in the mid-1970s, British film studios have been a top destination for American productions, and that impetus gathered pace in the past decade thanks to generous tax incentives and moviemakers' demand for experienced crews. More recently, Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services have snapped up studio space so quickly they set off a boom in studio building.
These big-budget productions employ thousands of local workers, and pour billions into the economy. Last year, a record 6.3 billion pounds ( $ 7.8 billion) was spent on film and high-end TV productions in Britain, according to the British Film Institute. Nearly 90 percent came from American studios or other foreign productions.
The number of films or television shows delayed in Britain since mid-July, when Hollywood actors joined the writers' strike, is relatively small, maybe about a dozen, but they are the big productions that require lots of crew and support an ecosystem of visual effects companies, catering and other services.
Charlotte Sewell, an assistant costume designer living in London, was working on the "Mission: Impossible" movie when the strikes stopped production. For a few weeks, she was able to work one day a week, but now that has ended, too.
"Now my one-day week has gone, I'll be trying to find some something somewhere," she said. "I'm not sure where yet."
Ms. Sewell, who is also the chair of the Bectu committee for costume and wardrobe department workers, said she supported the strikes, and she was confident she would be able to return to "Mission: Impossible" when the disputes ended.
In the meantime, she's nervous about her finances, especially paying her next self-employment tax bill, which is due in January.
"Because I've been in the industry a long time, I suppose, mentally, I'm more equipped to deal with the downtime, but financially not," she said.
She started in the business in 1992. Back then, the film industry was in "dire straits" after a funding slump, Ms. Sewell said, but recent years have been "amazing." There has been a noticeable shift in her work toward big American productions.
"We depend so much on U.S. studio-based productions for our work," she said, because British productions have died down. "I used to work in independent film all the time. I haven't done it for years because it just isn't there."
The problems for British workers has been exacerbated by a slowdown in domestic production, said Philippa Childs, the head of Bectu. The BBC's funding from viewers, through a license fee, was frozen by the government for two years until April 2024, and other British broadcasters are struggling with a drop in advertising revenue, restricting their ability to commission new work, especially as production costs are high. At the same time, film workers have been facing a squeeze on their own budgets from stubbornly high inflation.
Bectu is supportive of SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood union that represents actors, Ms. Childs said, in part because the issues that have provoked the U.S. walkout, like the use of artificial intelligence by studios, will "inevitably" have a big impact in Britain, too.
Most workers in the industry are freelancers, but unions say that does not mean the work is always precarious. After the pandemic lockdowns, demand for workers was high, and the industry was full of stories of people suddenly moving to other productions for better pay.
"We've gone from feast to famine," Ms. Childs said.
The ripple effects from the strikes are mostly on productions with stars who are SAG-AFTRA members -- who tend to be U.S.-based actors. But the impact is expected to grow, affecting more workers. Many parts of the British film industry are insulated from the strikes, however; domestic productions, with British actors or British union agreements, have gone on.
That could change. Equity, the British actors union, is closely watching the Hollywood negotiations ahead of contract renewals in Britain. A request for a 15 percent pay increase has been submitted to the production companies and will be followed by negotiations on working rights and conditions. Equity has a campaign called "Stop AI Stealing the Show," arguing that British law is failing to protect the rights of performers.
"We're obviously going to want what the Americans want," said Paul Fleming, the general secretary of Equity. "So we are facing the prospect of industrial unrest in the middle of next year."
For the past 13 years, Ian Ogden has worked as a grip, a crew member who moves and supports the camera. He was on reshoots for Disney's live-action remake of "Snow White" when strikes shut down filming in July.
"It's been pretty bleak ever since," he said.
Last month, Mr. Ogden said, he earned three-quarters of what he needed, and was using savings set aside for his two young children to pay for groceries. For weeks, he struggled to find new work as the productions still running tended to be smaller, not requiring as many cameras or grips, he said. Recently, he has found work on a British television production.
A member of Bectu who also holds a position in a charitable organization for grips, Mr. Ogden said, "I support the fight for rights." But he does not support the strike, he said, because it is hurting the offscreen workers who don't have the kind of financial support that Hollywood actors do.
"The people that it's affected in this country -- we're not millionaires," he said.

Strike Is a High-Stakes Gamble for Autoworkers and the Labor Movement

Since the start of the pandemic, labor unions have had something of a renaissance. They have made inroads into previously nonunion companies like Starbucks and Amazon, and won unusually strong contracts for hundreds of thousands of workers. Last year, public approval for unions reached its highest level since the Lyndon Johnson presidency.
What unions haven’t had during that stretch is a true gut-check moment on a national scale. Strikes by railroad workers and UPS employees, which had the potential to rattle the U.S. economy, were averted at the last minute. The fallout from the continuing writers’ and actors’ strikes has been heavily concentrated in Southern California.
The strike by the United Automobile Workers, whose members walked off the job at three plants Friday, is shaping up to be such a test. A contract with substantial wage increases and other concessions from the three automakers could announce organized labor as an economic force to be reckoned with and accelerate a recent wave of organizing.
But there are also real potential pitfalls. A prolonged strike could undermine the three established U.S. automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — and send the politically crucial Midwest into recession. If the union is seen as overreaching, or if it settles for a weak deal after a costly stoppage, public support could sour.
“Right now, unions are cool,” said Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, a firm representing management.
“But unions have a risk of not being very cool if you have five-month strike in LA and an X-month strike in how many other states,” he added.
If the stakes seem high for the UAW, that’s partly because the union’s new president, Shawn Fain, has gone out of his way to elevate them. During frequent video meetings with members before the strike, Fain has portrayed the negotiations as a broader struggle pitting ordinary workers against corporate titans.
“I know that we’re on the right side in this battle,” he said in a recent video appearance. “It’s a battle of the working class against the rich, the haves versus the have-nots, the billionaire class against everybody else.”
Fain’s framing of the contract campaign in class terms appears to be resonating with his members, thousands of whom have watched the online sessions.
Shunte Sanders-Beasley, a UAW member in Michigan who started working at a Chrysler plant in Indiana in 1999, said she saw the fight similarly.
“If you follow history, autoworkers tend to set the tone,” said Sanders-Beasley, who has served as vice president of her local and backed Fain’s campaign for the union’s presidency last year. “If we can win back some of the concessions we took, I’m hoping that it’ll be a trickle-down effect.”
A successful autoworker strike in 1937, which led GM to recognize the UAW for the first time, helped set in motion a wave of union organizing across a variety of industries like steel, oil, textiles and newspapers over the next few years.
Labor activists agreed that the current strike could reverberate across other industries, where workers appear to be paying close attention to the labor actions of the past year. “In organizing meetings, they say, ‘If they can do it, we can do it,’” said Jaz Brisack, an organizer with Workers United who played a key role in the Starbucks campaign.
But the flip side is that the strike could inflict collateral damage that creates frustration and hardship among tens of thousands of nonunion workers and their communities.
“The small and medium-sized manufacturers across the country that make up the automotive sector’s integrated supply chain will feel the brunt of this work stoppage, whether they are a union shop or not,” Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement Friday.
Higher wages and gains for rank-and-file workers can be good for the economy. But some argue that Fain’s and other labor leaders’ aggressive demands could discourage businesses from investing in the United States or render them uncompetitive with foreign rivals.
“Mr. Fain has to think about this, too: the long-term financial viability of these three companies,” said John Drake, vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Even those who welcome the union’s aggressive stance say it is fraught with risk. Gene Bruskin, a longtime union official who helped workers at a Smithfield meat-processing plant in North Carolina achieve, in 2008, one of the biggest organizing victories in decades, said a long strike could disillusion workers if the union came up short on key demands.
“If the UAW fails to make any significant gains, particularly on the two-tier stuff, their future could be seriously harmed,” said Bruskin, referring to a system in which newer workers are paid far less than veteran workers who perform similar jobs.
Bruskin also worried that the union could effectively win the battle and lose the war if the auto companies respond by shifting more production to Mexico, where they already have a significant presence.
The tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies for domestic production of electric vehicles that President Joe Biden has helped secure should limit that shift and help keep manufacturing jobs at home. Many automakers are already locating new plants in the United States to take advantage of the funds.
Still, Willy Shih, an expert on manufacturing at Harvard Business School, said the automakers could adjust their operations in ways that undercut the UAW while continuing to produce cars domestically. Automation is one option, he said, as is locating new plants in lightly unionized Southern states.
The Detroit automakers have created joint ventures with foreign battery makers outside the reach of the UAW’s national contracts and have sought to locate some of those plants in states like Tennessee and Kentucky. The union is seeking to bring workers at those plants up to the same pay and labor standards that direct employees of the Big Three enjoy, but it has not succeeded so far.
Given those threats, the union may feel justified in taking a more ambitious posture toward the automakers. The primary check on shifting work to other states will be the UAW’s ability to organize new plants, especially in the South, where it has struggled to gain traction for years. Experts argued that the union would probably increase its chances of attracting members there if it could point to large concrete gains.
“The answer is winning a strong contact here and using it to organize huge groups of autoworkers who are currently nonunion,” said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal who studies labor.
And there are other ways in which being too cautious may be a bigger risk to the union than being too aggressive. Organizers point out that workers are often demoralized when union leaders talk tough but then quickly settle for a subpar deal.
Critics of the previous UAW administration accused it of doing just that before Fain took over this year. “We’d be trying to make sense of how certain things passed in the first place,” Shana Shaw, another longtime UAW member who backed Fain, said of the concessionary contracts autoworkers were asked to accept over the years.
Even Fain’s habit of framing the fight in broad class terms may prove to be a strategic advantage. A recent Gallup poll found that 75% of the public backed the autoworkers in the showdown, compared with 19% who were more sympathetic to the companies.
The widespread public support suggests that the autoworkers may be operating in a different context from workers in another strike that famously contributed to a loss of power for labor: air traffic controllers’ unsuccessful fight against the Reagan administration in the early 1980s, after which private-sector employers appeared to become more comfortable firing and replacing striking employees.

Tech Titans Want to Build a New City. Can't They Just Fix What We've Already Got?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tech leaders are fed up with cities and their politics. So they want to start over. And that doesn't bode well for cities old or new.
We recently learned that the mysterious company gobbling up land in Solano County, Calif., is funded by venture capitalists including Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Steve Jobs's widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Their goal: build a new city from scratch. In doing so, they are getting in a long line of technotopians that includes the Google co-founder Larry Page and his effort to build cities "from the internet up," the Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and his plans for "charter cities" and the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and his desire for "Seasteader" cities floating on water. The Amazon founder Jeff Bezos wants to see cities floating in space, and Elon Musk has proposed cities in Texas and on Mars. There's even a venture capital firm funding the creation of new cities.
As a professor of urban tech who has worked in the industry for years, I've been recruited to lead some of these technotopian ventures. What I learned from these meetings keeps me focused on my day job. The tech leaders may have the money to build new cities, and they certainly have the hubris. What they lack is the disposition.
Cities and their problems have long bedeviled people in power. The technotopians are just the latest in a grand tradition of American business magnates aspiring to build their dreams -- from Pullman, Ill., to Epcot Center in Disney World. They tend to approach building cities the same way they've approached building tech start-ups. And that is unfortunate.
To state the obvious: Cities are not start-ups. They can't keep up with the tech industry's rate of innovation. That frustrates many technotopians, like the Thumbtack co-founder Jonathan Swanson, who once complained that "humans currently live in cities that are the equivalent of flip phones" -- the worst possible insult in Silicon Valley at the time.
Cities aren't like phones. They're not like computers either, a distinction that the University of Pennsylvania professor Shannon Mattern wrote an entire book to explain. Urban problems are too complex and politically fraught to be programmed into an app. Constructing a building takes much longer than constructing a website. And undoing the racist legacy of urban policies is more complicated than pushing through a software update.
Approaching complex urban problems as if they were engineering problems has led to some of the biggest mistakes in our urban history. During the urban renewal era of the mid-20th century, urban planners like Le Corbusier were so enthusiastic about the so-called "machine age" that they approached buildings and cities as if they were "machines for living." The results were mostly car-centric, soulless and segregated by use (and often by race), from Brasília to San Francisco's Fillmore neighborhood. City leaders have since spent billions working to deconstruct and reintegrate what those "machine age" planners built.
While today's technologies have made it easier to optimize urban life, they haven't helped us reach a collective agreement about what aspects of urban life deserve optimization. An overemphasis on urban technology can be a distraction from urban outcomes. For example, the frantic race to deploy autonomous vehicles on our streets appears to be more focused on perfecting the vehicles than on addressing cities' real mobility challenges. That's because technotopian proposals tend to focus on solving technology problems more than people problems. You can see this in how they pitch themselves. New technologies often outnumber people in their renderings, if people are pictured at all.
Refreshingly, the latest proposal from the technotopians in Solano County hasn't focused on the tech -- yet. Their renderings are surprisingly nostalgic for a storybook Mediterranean urbanism. But as The San Francisco Chronicle urban design critic put it, the renderings are impossible to critique, because, "what was unfurled is so innocuous as to be an insult. The images are as placid as a video aimed at infants."
Perhaps that is because this cohort of technotopians has learned from the mistakes of their peers, or because they've hired more thoughtful urbanists -- or, perhaps cynically, they're just trying to appeal to rural residents who will have to vote on the new city plan. Whatever the reason, I hope this time will be different. But with so many tech investors at the helm who are eager to pilot new technologies like flying cars, I'm not optimistic.
I get it. It's challenging to transform our existing cities and to pilot new tech solutions on our streets. Just look at the rocky rollout of e-scooters around the world. Wouldn't it be easier to test new technologies, business models and government structures in cities free of pesky people? That's certainly the aim of many technotopian plans, which call for new cities to be built, new rules to be written and new residents to opt in to being guinea pigs. Mr. Lonsdale, of Palantir, explains: "The idea is simple: found new cities, free from old bureaucratic and legal structures, and explore bold new visions of how government should work. Market them to people who choose to join and see what the world learns."
But these new cities are never really built from scratch. They usually encroach on someone else's land or run contrary to local plans. The technotopians rarely acknowledge that, which often leads to their downfall, as with Alphabet in Toronto and the Seasteaders in French Polynesia. The Solano project appears to be on a similar trajectory. They've snapped up land under a veil of secrecy, which has undermined needed political support. "If these investors plan to convince Solano residents and their elected representatives that building a new city on productive agricultural land is a wise scheme, they are off to a terrible start at earning the community's trust," John Garamendi, a Democrat who represents part of Solano County, testified at a recent State Senate committee hearing.
It's a shame the technotopians keep seeking out new territories. Our existing cities have plenty of problems to solve. And there are plenty of technologies that could help solve them. Their perpetual focus on starting from scratch is just a megalomaniac distraction.
No need to worry, you may think: Many of these places will never get built. But there's an opportunity cost to these utopian dreams. What if all the billions in venture capital money and media attention were refocused on solving real-world challenges in cities today? Could we better fix public transportation's pending fiscal cliff or the affordable housing crisis? I'm afraid we'll never know. The lure of starting from scratch is just too great.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Peru, he argued that global capitalism was at the root of the global ecological crisis, and he spent decades fighting for an alternative.
When asked to explain his worldview, the renowned Peruvian political and environmental activist Hugo Blanco liked to tell a story about mushrooms.
These mushrooms, he explained, grow only during the rainy season around his hometown, Cusco, on the eastern side of the Andes, making them a valuable delicacy.
One day in the market, he approached a woman who was standing beside a small mountain of them.
"I told her, 'I'll buy all of them without asking for a discount,' which was a good deal for her, because usually you pay less for more quantity," Mr. Blanco said in a 2017 interview with the arts and politics magazine Guernica. "But she told me, 'No. If I sell you all of them, what am I going to sell everyone else?' Selling wasn't just business, but a social relationship."
This, he said, was the essence of his belief in ecosocialism, a movement that sees capitalism as the driving force behind the world's growing environmental crisis. For over 30 years he led marches against mines, rallied international support for the Amazon and organized efforts to expand autonomy for Indigenous people.
He was part Quechua -- the Indigenous people who populate the Andean highlands -- and he brought to his cause the collectivist traditions that he had learned when he was growing up; hence the story about the mushrooms. Human survival, he said, meant setting aside the profit motive in favor of a greater common good.
"I've always fought for social equality," he told Guernica. "But now there's a more important problem: the survival of my species. One hundred more years of rule by transnational companies and they're going to exterminate the human species as they've exterminated other species."
Mr. Blanco died on June 25 in Uppsala, Sweden, though his death was not widely reported at the time. He was 88. His daughter Carmen Blanco Valer said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was a gastric obstruction.
For much of his life, Mr. Blanco considered himself a follower of Leon Trotsky, the Russian Communist leader who advocated maximum reliance on a mass movement of workers in a socialist revolution.
But over time, his communism became flecked with concern over the environmental degradation that was ravaging Peru in the form of strip mining and deforestation. He spent time with, and admired, the Zapatistas of southern Mexico, an armed group that pushed away both multinational corporations and the government in favor of grass-roots control.
"We have reached a situation in which the 'private ownership of the means of production' has been turned into the 'private ownership of the means of destruction,' which will plunge us into the abyss," he wrote in the left-wing magazine Canadian Dimension in 2008.
Hugo Blanco Galdós was born on Nov. 15, 1934, to Miguel Ángel Blanco, a lawyer who defended Quechua clients, and Victoria (Galdós) Blanco, a Quechua woman who owned a small farm.
His first marriage, to Vilma Valer, ended in divorce. Along with his daughter Carmen, he is survived by his second wife, Ana Sandoval; his sons, Marco, Bruno, Oscar and Hugo; another daughter, Maria Blanco Berglund; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
When he was 10, Mr. Blanco heard about a landowner who had branded one of his Quechua workers with a hot iron. His leftist sympathies were further deepened by his two brothers, both of whom were Communists.
He studied agronomy in Argentina at the University of La Plata, a hotbed of Marxism south of Buenos Aires. But he left school after a U.S.-backed coup overthrew Guatemala's left-wing government in 1954, deciding that he needed to throw himself full time into the struggle.
He found jobs in factories, where he organized industrial workers -- first in Argentina, then back in Peru, where he took part in protests against a 1958 visit by Vice President Richard M. Nixon in which Nixon's motorcade was stoned.
Mr. Blanco soon saw that, at least in his home country, the masses were in the fields and not in the factories. He returned to Cusco.
Though he disliked being called a leader, he soon became the head of a growing movement among the Quechua peasants against the owners of the country's vast cocoa and coffee plantations, whose exploitative labor practices kept their workers in deep poverty.
In 1959, Mr. Blanco and some 300,000 other people began occupying the plantations, capturing hundreds before the military intervened. It was a relatively nonviolent action, though he shot and killed a police officer -- in self-defense, he claimed. He was arrested and swiftly condemned to death.
The sentence made him a cause célèbre for the international left. Soon the Peruvian government was inundated with protests from the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Bertrand Russell.
Mr. Blanco's sentence was reduced to 25 years in prison -- first in solitary confinement, then on a rocky island off the Peruvian coast. Eventually a new government came to power and freed him, then sent him into exile.
He went first to Mexico, then Argentina and finally Chile, not long before a military coup overthrew that country's socialist leader, Salvador Allende, in 1973. With his life suddenly in danger, Mr. Blanco took refuge in the Swedish Embassy.
He emerged a few days later in disguise and soon made his way to Sweden, where he lived for much of the 1970s. He was able to return late in the decade and joined mainstream politics in the '80s, first as a representative and then as a senator in the Peruvian Congress.
He went into exile again in 1992 after President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress in what was called a self-coup. Mr. Blanco returned in the early 2000s, though he continued to spend stretches of time in Mexico and Sweden.
As his emphasis on environmental activism grew, he led marches against Andean mining operations and toured the world as a speaker, inspiring -- and being inspired by -- younger generations of activists, including Greta Thunberg of Sweden. He also founded a newspaper, Lucha Indígena, to share information with grass-roots activists around the country.
"I think that what we need to push forward is the movement for collectivity," he told Guernica. "That's what I believe in: power from below. And that organized society can be like that."

Full text: The Kering Foundation held a benefit, Haider Ackermann hosted an intimate dinner and LaQuan Smith threw an after-party.
A crowd frequently spotted on yachts filled the Pool restaurant in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night for the second annual Caring for Women Dinner hosted by the Kering Foundation.
"I said yes because Salma asked," Oprah Winfrey, a co-chair for the dinner, said as she addressed the room, referring to Salma Hayek Pinault, who is also a co-chair and board member of the Kering Foundation.
The space was filled to the brim with tropical plants and marquee names.
"I don't get out much," Ms. Winfrey said, adding, "I only come out with the intention of using my voice in a way that can be meaningful and helpful."
Inside the dining room, where guests were served a dinner of scallop aguachile and lamb belly, Leonardo DiCaprio sat with Olivia Wilde, Prabal Gurung and Malala Yousafzai, and across from Zoë Kravitz and her partner, Channing Tatum.
Also at the table was François-Henri Pinault, Ms. Hayek Pinault's husband and the chairman and chief executive of Kering, the luxury group that owns brands including Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent. (Mr. Pinault's family office, Artémis, recently bought a majority stake in one of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency.)
Seated nearby was Kim Kardashian, Lindsey Vonn, the skier, and Lauren Sánchez, who is engaged to Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder.
The gala dinner, which also featured an auction and performance from Florence Welch of Florence and The Machine, raised more than $ 3 million to benefit the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Malala Fund and the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Violence.
"Well, look, it's always fun to feel beautiful and glamorous," said the journalist Lisa Ling, who served as a host. "But really the reason I'm here, and the reason I am honored to be here, is because of the work that this foundation is doing."

Haider Ackermann and Augustinus Bader Dinner
On a quiet block on the Upper East Side, about 40 guests, including the filmmaker Sofia Coppola, the actor Oscar Isaac, the singer and model Karen Elson, the actor and musician Jared Leto and the architect Peter Marino, trickled into a small dinner on Friday night at the Salon 94 gallery, in part, to celebrate a very expensive face cream.
It was the first collaboration between Augustinus Bader, known for its high-priced creams and serums, and Haider Ackermann, who was a guest designer for Jean Paul Gaultier earlier this year.
Mr. Ackermann designed a silver, limited edition bottle (which costs $ 565), and said he wanted to create a mirror-like vessel to signify the ritual of looking at oneself in the morning.
"You can carry it everywhere with you and just have a look at yourself," he said.
Guests waited patiently for dinner to begin, snacking on miniature crab and apple bites, chatting politely until Timothée Chalamet, Mr. Ackermann's "beloved TIMO BRO," and Kylie Jenner, whom he dressed for this year's Met Gala, arrived to the flash of photographers. Mr. Chalamet hugged Mr. Ackermann and the actor's "Dune" co-star, Mr. Isaac.
Mr. Chalamet and Ms. Jenner's recent appearances together at Beyoncé's Renaissance show in Los Angeles and the U.S. Open have been popular online fodder, further stirring dating rumors. At the dinner, the pair held hands and posed for photographs as a security guard waited several feet away.
Shortly after they arrived, guests moved to a long dinner table for squash blossoms and roasted striped bass. A bottle of the brand's rich cream was placed at each seat.
Is there anything you do to feel better if you're not feeling beautiful?

LaQuan Smith Spring 2024 After-party
In a cavernous venue on West 57th Street, a large replica of Michelangelo's "David" greeted guests like the model Coco Rocha, the actress Vivica A. Fox and the rapper Saweetie as they arrived at the after-party for LaQuan Smith's spring 2024 show.
Held at the Stranger nightclub, advertised as a "panoply of pleasures," the space felt like a surreal Cirque du Soleil fun house with oversized animals.
Mr. Smith was piled with hellos and praises as he wove through the crowd. Guests dressed in sheer tops and metallic colorways mimicked the boldness of outfits worn by Beyoncé, Rihanna and Vice President Kamala Harris, which were designed by him.
In a crowded karaoke room, Jackie Aina, the beauty influencer, rapped through "Put It on da Floor Again," the hit featuring Latto and Cardi B.
Topless dancers and a panda mascot rotated through a central platform across the D.J. booth on the main stage; bubbles and confetti floated above the dance floor; and a trapeze artist in a red corset was on top of a rainbow playground parachute.
Yvonne Orji, the actor, arrived just before 2 a.m. with Elaine Welteroth, the journalist and author, who said it was a rare night out for her.
"I think that only LaQuan can get me out of the house in a metallic silver miniskirt," Ms. Welteroth said.
Ms. Orji spent fashion week celebrating Black designers, like Mr. Smith and Sergio Hudson. "And on the heels of Coco Gauff winning the U.S. Open," she said, "it's just a beautiful Black weekend."
On the days when you don't feel your highest self, what do you do to get there?
When do you really feel your best?
What is the recipe for what you think is cool?

Lineups That Reflect A Numbing Sameness: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tired familiarity of the reality-heavy network schedules is a reminder of the issues that led to the work stoppages.
Fall TV this year rolls in amid the fog of the writers' and actors' strikes. The networks have been slow to commit to their schedules, still rejiggering their lineups for September and beyond. Cable outlets have been bumping the release dates of in-the-can shows, lest they wither without promotion by their stars, an activity prohibited by the actors' guild during the strike. The streaming archives beckon.
At first glance the fall network schedules suggest the work stoppages have had an impact: They are overstuffed with reality competitions and game shows, whose employees generally work under different contracts from those of the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA.
ABC's Wednesday prime-time lineup consists of "Celebrity Jeopardy!" followed by "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune" followed by "The $ 100,000 Pyramid." On Thursdays CBS added a new competition called "Buddy Games" to go along with the long-running "Big Brother" and another installment of "The Challenge: USA." On Fox, celebrities endure military training on Mondays ("Special Forces: World's Toughest Test"), guess songs on Tuesdays ("Celebrity Name That Tune") and croon in ridiculous outfits on Wednesdays ("The Masked Singer").
However, aside from "Buddy Games," essentially summer camp competitions for groups of adult friends, none of the shows in the previous paragraph are new -- the networks have been churning out unscripted prime-time shows by the bushel for years. Overall, their lineups are eerily steady, more like an extended summer season of familiar titles and reruns than an uncharacteristically barren fall slate.
So the schedules end up reflecting the strikes not because they look radically different, but because their numbing sameness is a reminder of the issues that led to the work stoppages -- that everything is simply "content," and the only kind of value is monetary value.
What are we to assume about the studios' feelings toward the people who make television when their offerings suggest apathy regarding the people who watch it? Or perhaps these lackluster lineups are the product of corporate strategy, now that seemingly all of TV has been consolidated within a few media megaliths that are transforming how shows get made and creators get paid.
It is little wonder ABC is happy to offer up singing contests and celebs spinning the Wheel when Disney, its owner, would like you to subscribe to Hulu and Disney+ for scripted family and prestige shows along with franchise fare like the Marvel and "Star Wars" series. CBS? Oh, you mean the broadcast home of the Paramount Global empire, where you can also watch repeats of Paramount shows like "FBI True" and "Yellowstone?"
(This shift isn't limited to networks, of course. Think not of HBO as a refined tastemaker in a separate TV universe from home-makeover shows and insects pulled from people's bodies -- imagine instead an array of treasures and garbage and the "Friends" catalog all piled up under one meaningless heading: Max.)
This is hardly the first fall to be full of reality shows. ABC was always going to air another season of "Dancing With the Stars" (this will be its 32nd); NBC was always going to air "The Voice" (Season 24); CBS was always going to air "Survivor" (45) and "The Amazing Race" (35); and Fox has slotted "Hell's Kitchen" (22) in its fall line-up plenty of times. Even though the CW is largely ceding any claim to original programming, opting instead to fill out its fall schedule with an array of existing foreign shows, it is still airing new episodes of its version of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?," which begins its 12th season in November.
NBC is spreading out the reruns of the "Law & Order" and "Chicago" franchises, its reliance on the Dick Wolf universe a core programming strategy for much of the past three decades. ABC will keep "America's Funniest Home Videos" alive until the sun eats the earth. Fox's animated comedies are shelf stable for the time being.
Even most of the new fare colors comfortably inside the lines. ABC's "Golden Bachelor" is "The Bachelor" with a 71-year-old widower at its center. NBC has two scripted dramas: "The Irrational" and "Found," each a spin on the crime procedural, lest any American go more than a few minutes without seeing someone ducking under yellow crime-scene tape. Fox has a new cartoon from Dan Harmon ("Krapopolis"), his third current animated series. CBS is airing the original British version of "Ghosts" as a companion to reruns of its American version -- an inspired choice in its way, but also a simple one, given the adaptation's success.
Otherwise, our newcomers include the already mentioned "Buddy Games," hosted and executive produced by Josh Duhamel, who previously made two movies based on the same concept, and two CBS game shows: "Lotería Loca," hosted by Jaime Camil, a TV version of the bingo-style game lotería; and "Raid the Cage," an adaptation of an Israeli show that involves people grabbing prizes out of a cage. Lastly, there is Fox's "Snake Oil," a hybrid of "Shark Tank" and "Bullsh*t," hosted by David Spade.
To be fair, the networks have been counted out many times before, and shows like ABC's "Abbott Elementary," which scored eight Emmy nominations in July, and "Ghosts" demonstrate that there is still plenty of fun and specialness to be had in a broadcast format. Those and other sitcoms and procedurals could be back with new episodes in the new year. (Or perhaps even earlier, if the strikes somehow get resolved soon.) But such sparks are rare.
Way back in the early 2000s, premium cable shows began to mostly outshine network ones and plenty of streaming series have since done the same -- winning awards, amassing cachet, draining our wallets. Fair enough! After a while, it seemed like the networks were barely putting up a fight; cop shows and singing competitions as far as the eye can see, plus "Grey's Anatomy" and "The Simpsons."
But now the new flashy ride at the fair is not a pricier, fancier platform; it's free, ad-supported streaming television. The increasing popularity of these platforms, like the Roku Channel, Tubi, Pluto and Amazon's Freevee, suggests that viewers want to recreate the basic-cable experience of yesteryear with marathons of classics, but they also want fun and interesting original shows (Freevee's "Jury Duty" got four Emmy nominations this year, including for best comedy) and are happy to tolerate ads. That's a network television audience.
That also means networks could occupy a different space in the public imagination -- the main floor isn't the penthouse, but hey, it's not the garden unit or the storage basement either. Mass-appeal comedies and long-season dramas still have value in the streaming era, perhaps more now than ever before as a way to lure parents and children away from their individual screens.
Maybe a fall of game shows will eventually alienate viewers and consequently, convince program executives of the worth of actual creativity. Maybe it will lead to more adventurous attitudes in Hollywood when the strikes eventually end. Maybe the next time the networks have to put things on hold, we will actually feel the loss.

A Look at Oscar Season Amid the Two Strikes: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Buchanan, Kyle

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The delay of some big titles, like "Dune: Part Two," has ramifications for coming releases like "May December" and "Killers of the Flower Moon."
Three years after the pandemic forced the majority of Oscar season to take place on Zoom, Hollywood may be facing another circumscribed awards circuit.
Dual strikes by SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America have already had a significant effect on this year's movie calendar: Studios have opted to push several big theatrical releases like "Dune: Part Two" to 2024, since SAG-AFTRA is prohibiting its members from promoting major-studio films amid the walkout. That same ban could radically reshape the Oscar season landscape, since awards shows and the media-blitz ecosystem built around them depend on star wattage to survive. (The strikes have already prompted the Emmys to move from September to January, and other ceremonies could be delayed, too.)
So what will the season look like if the strikes continue into late fall or winter? Expect these four predictions to come to pass.
Streamers will be at a major advantage.
The post-pandemic theatrical landscape is already difficult enough for prestige titles: Last year, best-picture nominees "The Fabelmans," "The Banshees of Inisherin," "Tár" and "Women Talking" all struggled to break out at the box office. Subtract the months of press that the stars of contending films are called upon to do, and the financial forecast for specialty films grows even more dire. If striking actors aren't available to promote this season's year-end titles, many studios will think twice about releasing them.
Streamers don't have the same problem, since they worry more about clicks than box office numbers. So far, Netflix, Apple and Amazon have been proceeding full speed ahead with their awards-season slates: Though the actors in streaming films like "Nyad" (with Annette Bening as the long-distance swimmer); "Saltburn" (a thriller about obsession); and "Killers of the Flower Moon" (a historical drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio) may not be free to do much press, there's ultimately no more effective advertisement for a streamer than simply throwing big pictures of a movie star on the app's home page.
Directors are the new stars.
The monthslong awards circuit can raise a filmmaker's profile considerably: Near the end of their seasons, auteurs like Bong Joon Ho ("Parasite") and Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan ("Everything Everywhere All at Once") were as recognizable as movie stars, and often just as mobbed at awards shows. Still, if the actors strike continues for several more months, studios will need to rely even more on their directors, since they may be the sole representatives of their films who are available for big profiles, audience Q. and A.s and ceremonies.
Well-established auteurs like Martin Scorsese ("Killers of the Flower Moon") and Christopher Nolan ("Oppenheimer") will be at a particular advantage here, as will new-school academy favorites like Greta Gerwig ("Barbie") and Emerald Fennell ("Saltburn"). The latter two have a significant side hustle as actors, which may prove appealing in a season that will lack thespian faces, though their fellow actor-turned-director Bradley Cooper will be in a bit of a bind: How can he promote "Maestro," his forthcoming Leonard Bernstein movie, if he also stars in it?
'Barbenheimer' could rule again.
The dual release of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" proved to be the cinematic event of the summer, as Gerwig's doll comedy broke box-office records and Nolan's biopic defied the doldrums that have recently plagued prestige dramas. Both films were already poised to be major awards contenders, but the decimation of the year-end theatrical calendar will only reinforce their dominance.
For old-school voters who still prefer to support theatrical releases instead of streaming films, "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" might as well be running unopposed. The punt of "Dune: Part Two" to 2024 will only further help those two films' awards cases, as the craft categories where the first "Dune" dominated -- like production design, sound, editing and visual effects -- are now decidedly up for grabs.
Up-and-coming actors may miss out on breakthroughs.
Awards season can sometimes feel like a glamorous grind, requiring stars to commit to months of near-constant interviews, actor round tables, audience Q. and A.s, and hotel-ballroom hobnobs. Still, the season is invaluable when it comes to raising an actor's profile. Up-and-comers become A-listers through their sheer ubiquity, and some of this season's rising stars will miss out on the career glow-up that's possible from a prolonged awards press tour: I'm thinking of people like "May December" actor Charles Melton, who nearly steals the movie from its leading ladies, Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore (who play an actress and a Mary Kay Letourneau-like teacher, respectively).
Though it would be a fine line to walk, it's possible that some of the smaller studios may seek interim agreements with SAG-AFTRA that would allow actors to do Oscar-season press. For example, A24 has secured interim agreements with SAG-AFTRA to continue shooting films since it is not among the studios the guilds are striking against. Could the company secure a similar carve-out that would allow the cast of its summer hit "Past Lives" to become awards-show fixtures? If the strikes continue and no such arrangements are possible, Oscar voters may be forced into an unprecedented position: Without all the usual noise that surrounds an awards contender, they'll simply have to decide whether to nominate a performance based on its merit alone. What a concept!

Cable TV Is on Life Support, But a New Bundle Is Coming Alive: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A funny thing happened in recent weeks, as the media industry wrung its hands over the long-anticipated death of the lucrative cable-TV bundle: Hundreds of thousands of people turned to a different bundle.
Take Christopher Antoniacci of Anna Maria, Fla. When the standoff between Disney and the cable giant Charter left him among nearly 15 million cable subscribers without ESPN and many other channels, he took matters into his own hands.
At Charter's suggestion, Mr. Antoniacci, 74, downloaded FuboTV, a streaming service that offers channels including ESPN. Nearly 500,000 people did the same over the last two weeks, according to Sensor Tower, an analytics firm.
"It has almost everything that I require," said Mr. Antoniacci, who signed up for a free trial. "It's a cable substitute, and it appears to be working," he added.
As cord cutting accelerates across the country, with millions of Americans dropping their traditional cable-TV packages each year, it threatens to upend the pay-TV bundle, a linchpin of the media industry for decades. That became clear when Charter, in its war of words with Disney, declared that parts of the cable bundle were "broken."
But the resolution between the two companies this week signaled that the bundle is probably not going anywhere. It's just adjusting for new viewing habits, with cable companies aiming to sell new packages that include streaming services.
As part of the deal, Disney+, a streaming service that includes many of Disney's biggest shows and movies, will now be offered to Charter's TV customers.
"We very much can look back at this Disney-Charter deal as an opening salvo of a broader re-bundling," MoffettNathanson, an influential research firm, said in a note on Monday.
For more than a half-century, the cable-TV bundle was one of the best businesses in the history of media. TV giants like Disney were paid twice: first by cable distributors, which shelled out billions every year to have channels like ESPN available for their subscribers, and then by advertisers, which opened their wallets to promote products alongside the hottest shows.
The bundle was also good for the cable providers, which steadily added subscribers: At the peak of traditional cable in 2012, more than 100 million Americans paid for the bundle.
That era is gone. Now, about five million people abandon cable TV every year -- leaving about 75 million Americans in the traditional TV ecosystem, according to analyst estimates.
Most analysts believe that 40 million to 60 million Americans will continue to subscribe to some form of traditional cable in the years to come. The sharp falloff, however, is shifting the ground under media companies and distributors alike.
Already, many cord-cutters are piecing together their own bundle, subscribing to a mix of services including Netflix, Max and Hulu. The deal between Disney and Charter has made it clear that cable providers -- which often provide broadband internet service -- are eager to put together streaming bundles for them.
William Rouhana, the chief executive of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, which owns several ad-supported streaming services, said Disney's deal with Charter was proof that the traditional cable business was changing drastically.
"I think this could be the precursor to a very big shift in the industry," he said.
The winners and losers of the new game have yet to be determined. But in the short term, at least, the new bundling will probably not be as profitable as the traditional cable business, said Tom Freston, who was a member of MTV's founding team and a former chief executive of Viacom.
That spells trouble for the titans of the media industry, which are trying to milk the cash-rich cable business for as long as possible while they build streaming services to replace them, he said.
Mr. Freston noted that live sports and news programming, which have yet to be completely replicated by streaming services, remained vital to the pay-TV bundle. National Football League games, an entertainment mainstay for tens of millions of Americans, will remain on traditional television for years because of existing contracts, guaranteeing a lifeline for cable providers.
But streamers are starting to encroach on that territory, too. Amazon and YouTube are making inroads with N.F.L. fans by securing football rights, and Apple has begun to show Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer matches.
"It's hard to fight the convenience of improved technology," Mr. Freston said. "When sports and news inevitably move over to the streamers, that will be the end of the game. And what a game it was."
Still, Mr. Antoniacci, who had turned to FuboTV during the Charter-Disney face-off, said he wasn't willing to count pay TV out for good. He has been a cable subscriber for several decades, paying for television and internet access. He had been considering downgrading his cable subscription, keeping a slimmer package with access to his local news stations.
But for now, he's keeping what he had.
"This situation is making me reflect a lot on how I use these media providers," Mr. Antoniacci said.

TikTok Rankles Employees With Return-to-Office Tracking Tools: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company is requiring many employees to use an app that tracks their in-person attendance.
TikTok employees in the United States expressed frustration and dismay this week after the company introduced a tool for tracking office attendance and threatened disciplinary action for failing to comply with new in-person mandates, in an unusual effort to get workers back into the office with custom data-collection technology.
Employees at TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, received notices this week about the new tool, an app called MyRTO. The app, which is built into the company's internal software, monitors badge swipes and asks employees to explain "deviations" -- absences on days they are meant to be in the office -- according to emails and screenshots shared with The New York Times.
A dashboard with the data is visible to employees, their supervisors and human resource staff members.
TikTok requires many of its roughly 7,000 U.S. employees to work in offices three times a week beginning in October. Some teams are expected in five days a week. Employees were told that "any deliberate and consistent disregard may result in disciplinary action" and could "impact on performance reviews."
TikTok's workers have been taken aback by the disciplinarian tone of the messaging and the appearance of the MyRTO dashboard, which serves as a reminder that the company is monitoring their daily whereabouts, according to interviews with multiple employees, who would speak only anonymously. One of the employees, who said some in-person work was important, added that the app and threats of punishment were unnecessary, and that colleagues were now fearful about the consequences of failing to comply.
Zach Dunn, an expert on hybrid work and a founder of the hybrid management company Robin, said it was "exceedingly rare" for companies to monitor badge swipes so closely and to threaten disciplinary action on attendance.
"We've seen folks say, 'This will be considered as part of your overall performance evaluation,"' he said. "That's different from saying, 'If you don't do this, you will be disciplined."'
Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said the tool was meant to help set expectations for in-office attendance.
"The ultimate goal of MyRTO is to provide greater clarity and context to both employees and leaders regarding their RTO expectations and in-office schedules, and help foster more transparent communications," Ms. Seth said.
More than three years into the saga of return-to-office planning, many companies have settled into hybrid work arrangements. Just over one quarter of workdays performed by American workers are done from home, according to research from Stanford, and offices across the country remain under 50 percent of their prepandemic occupancy, according to Kastle, a workplace security firm.
Many tech companies, including Zoom and Meta, have asked employees to start reporting to the office this summer and fall. Some of these policies have provoked pushback, including at Amazon, where corporate employees staged a walkout in May.
Some companies are tightening their enforcement efforts, indicating that they will monitor badge swipes to ensure that employees are showing up. Google, which asked most of its employees to be in the office three days a week, will use badge swipes to identify prolonged absences from the office, which could be incorporated into performance review conversations.
But few companies have created custom tools and dashboards with daily logs of that data for employees and their managers.
TikTok has employees in U.S. cities including in Los Angeles, Washington and New York. The company grew significantly during the pandemic but has struggled to get its far-flung work force into its offices.
In an email to employees that introduced MyRTO, TikTok described its goals for in-office work and said that "we are now providing the next suite of tools and information for both employees and leaders to better allocate time spent in the office optimizing collaboration."
In August, the company told New York employees that a lunch stipend would be linked to an app that required a check-in from the office for access to the funds, according to two of the workers who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The employees said the app felt like another way to check on their location.
Mr. Dunn said TikTok's attitude toward in-person work might be influenced by TikTok and ByteDance's overseas leadership. He cited data from his firm showing that workers in the Asia-Pacific region have largely resumed their prepandemic commutes.
"For companies, especially where they have leadership based in this region, they probably don't see what the big deal is because they've been doing this for well over a year," Mr. Dunn said. "The expectation is the office."

The Pluses and Minuses To Plugging In Your New iPhone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The dream of carrying one power cable for all your devices is becoming a reality. But things aren't as simple as they sound.
The iPhone 15 (technically, the 17th iteration of the iconic Apple phone) has arrived with a big change that is sure to annoy many of us. Eventually, however, we'll breathe a sigh of relief.
Allow me to unpack that. To comply with recent European regulations, the iPhone 15, unveiled Tuesday, will abandon the Lightning connector that has been the method for charging iPhones for 11 years. In its place will be a different oval-shaped connector: USB-C.
For the average tech user, change isn't fun. This all means that when Apple customers buy their next iPhones, they will no longer be able to plug in all the Lightning accessories they have collected, such as charging cables, speaker docks and earbuds. They will have to replace those with new products that use USB-C connectors to plug into the new iPhones.
This transition feels like a bit of déjà vu. In 2012, Apple killed the relatively bulky 30-pin connector on iPhones to switch to Lightning, a slimmer and faster charging technology, which rendered many speakers and chargers obsolete.
What's different this time is that most of us already have a USB-C cable. Modern headphones, game consoles and many laptops, including Apple's MacBooks, long ago adopted USB-C as a standard charging port. The iPhone was one of the holdouts.
Why is this happening now? Last year, the European Union announced a mandate requiring all smartphone makers to adopt USB-C as a common charging connector by 2024. In theory, this will allow consumers to buy fewer power cables, which, regulators say, could cut down on environmental waste. Thierry Breton, a European commissioner involved in the legislation, said on LinkedIn this month: "A common charger is common sense."
So we are heading toward an era of standardization in which one type of charger works with most of our electronics, which would be ideal. Many of us are familiar with the scenario in which someone is carrying an iPhone cable but a family member or friend needs a different one (likely a USB-C) to replenish their non-Apple phone or computer. Those days, in theory, will be no more.
But as is always the case with any big technology shift, it's not as simple as it sounds. New dangers lie ahead -- including the ability to destroy your phone with the wrong USB-C wire, phone repair experts say. If you're going to carry only one cable, it's more important than ever to be judicious about what you buy.
"Charger damage is a real thing," said Jessa Jones, the owner of iPad Rehab, a mobile phone and tablet repair shop. "It's very common, and it's something you need to watch out for."
Here's what to know:
Not all USB-C cables are created equal.
The first step is to stop thinking about modern charging cables as dumb wires.
High-quality chargers are essentially electronics with tiny circuit boards inside them. On Apple's official Lightning cable, there are two chips: One authenticates that the cable is made by Apple, while the other acts as a fuse that isolates damage to the charger. In the event of a power fluctuation, for example, only the charger would be destroyed and not the phone itself, Ms. Jones said.
The problem with USB-C cables is that while they usually look the same, the cheaper, low-quality cords offer no such protection for your device. They may have the correct oval connector, but inside, they lack chips to protect your phone.
So if you need a USB-C cable, don't grab any cheap wire, like the $ 5 ones you'll see at a gas station kiosk. Invest in a durable cable from a reputable company. Brands like Anker, Belkin and Amazon Basics are well known for their high-quality power cables that cost roughly $ 9 to $ 30, according to John Bumstead, the owner of RDKL Inc., a repair shop that refurbishes MacBooks. Buy the cables from trusted retailers or directly from the brands themselves -- and avoid purchasing used wires on sites like eBay.
Be careful what you plug into.
Many USB-C cables lack chips to restrict the current powering your phone. So if you plug it into a source that charges at a higher voltage than your phone accepts, you could electrocute your phone, Ms. Jones said.
The lesson here is to be careful about what you plug your cord into. Those USB ports embedded into airplane back seats, hotel room walls or car consoles are a big no-no because it's unclear what their charging rates are. It's safest to plug your USB-C cable only into a high-quality charging brick that protects your phone. Wirecutter, our sister publication, recommends USB-C power bricks from Anker, RAVPower and Spigen that do a good job replenishing your phone quickly without damaging it.
There's always wireless.
For iPhone owners who aren't planning on upgrading right away but need new chargers, the most cost-effective alternative to buying another Lightning cable is to go wireless. The E.U. mandate applies only to wires that plug directly into devices -- not wireless charging devices that replenish your phone via magnetic induction, such as Apple's puck-shaped MagSafe, which magnetizes to the back of your phone, or wireless charging pads and stands from brands like Mophie, Anker and Belkin. So those are fine purchases for the foreseeable future.
Bottom Line
As long as you own a robust cable and a nice charging brick, you will probably be happy with this transition. The USB-C charging standard is faster at transferring data than Lightning, and there may even be some cool perks, like the ability to plug your phone directly into an external display to look at photos.
More important, when you're traveling or commuting, you will no longer have to carry a jungle of wires in your bag, and if you leave your cable at home, chances are you'll be near someone who is carrying the same one.

Profitable Instacart Veers From Gig Economy Roots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As it prepares to go public next week, Instacart shows that one secret to making money as a gig economy company is to become an advertising company.
When Fidji Simo took over as chief executive of Instacart in 2021, the grocery delivery start-up's growth was cratering as its pandemic boom ebbed. The board of directors asked her to find new ways for the company to earn money.
Ms. Simo, a former executive at Meta with experience in advertising, played to her strengths. She aggressively expanded Instacart's advertising business, begun in 2019, which allows food brands to pay for better placement in the company's app. Brands had questioned whether the ads were helping, so Ms. Simo commissioned studies demonstrating their efficacy, two people familiar with the company said.
She also hatched a plan to sell software tools and other products to grocery companies to help improve shopping experiences, they said. Then she embarked on a good-will tour to visit the grocery companies and hosted their executives at her home in Carmel, Calif.
As Instacart prepares to go public next week, it is a markedly different company. Envisioned in 2012 as a service that matched people at home with contract workers who would shop for them and deliver groceries, it has increasingly focused on advertising and software products as its delivery business has slowed.
Last month, Instacart revealed in an offering prospectus that the ads and software sales had allowed it to do what skeptics considered impossible -- turn a profit. Other so-called gig economy companies that use contract workers to deliver goods via apps have typically failed to do so.
Nearly a third of Instacart's $ 2.5 billion in revenue last year came from its "highly profitable" ads and software division, according to its prospectus. In the first half of this year, Instacart's $ 406 million in revenue from ads and software helped propel it to $ 242 million in profit.
Instacart shows that one way for a historically unprofitable gig business to get to the public markets is to diversify into more lucrative areas and move away from its gig-economy roots. It has been a long road for the start-up, which weathered years of losing money and the 2021 resignation of its co-founder and former chief executive, Apoorva Mehta, after friction with the board.
Still, Instacart's profits may not be enough to attract investors to its I.P.O. Once worth $ 39 billion in the private markets, the company has slashed its valuation several times, most recently to $ 10 billion. In a filing this week, it set a price range of $ 26 to $ 28 a share, valuing it at $ 8.9 billion at the midpoint. Instacart plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange, days after the public offering of Arm, the British chip designer.
In an interview last year, Ms. Simo, who is now 37, said she was overseeing a "third act of the company" -- after first attracting consumers and then attracting grocers -- which included the software tools for retailers. She said her goal was for Instacart to compete more with Amazon, which offers grocery delivery services, and to help grocery stores adapt to the digital world.
"It really shows very clearly where we're going as a company and this new ambition," Ms. Simo said.
Instacart declined to comment, citing a quiet period before its I.P.O. Meredith Kopit Levien, The New York Times's chief executive, sits on Instacart's board.
From its founding in 2012, Instacart burned through cash, like other companies at the time that jumped on the proliferation of smartphones and cloud computing to offer real-world services via apps. At the tap of a button, these apps conjured up services including dog walking, housecleaning, takeout and taxi rides.
Investors ate them up, betting the companies would grow large enough to generate profits. But even though consumers loved the apps' convenience, they scoffed at high fees. Many of the companies went under or sold. The most successful -- Uber, Lyft and DoorDash -- have never turned an annual profit.
Mr. Mehta, Instacart's co-founder, had plans to change that. A former engineer at Amazon, he determined early on that Instacart could build a business promoting products to its customers using the data it collected on their grocery purchases, just as Amazon had.
"The belief was if we reached enough scale, there would be an interesting advertising business to be built," said Ali Rowghani, an investor in Instacart.
When Instacart started selling ads four years ago, its executives debated whether they would turn off customers, a person familiar with the conversations said. After internal tests showed that the impact was minimal, the company increased the types and frequency of ads shown.
Ms. Simo took over Instacart during a volatile period. The company had benefited from the pandemic when people stuck at home ordered groceries through the app, sending its grocery sales soaring 303 percent in 2020. Growth continued into 2021 but slowed to 20 percent overall that year as people returned to shopping in person in stores.
Ihar Mahaniok, an investor at Geek Ventures who provided funding to Instacart in 2012, said the start-up's potential had excited him but that he had worried about its ability to make money. He was encouraged by Ms. Simo's appointment, he said, because he had worked on her team at Meta and had seen firsthand how she balanced innovative ideas with efficiency.
"I really trusted she'd be able to figure this out, and she did," he said.
Ms. Simo strengthened the advertising business by adding more than a dozen tools, including video ads and pop-ups. She also introduced Instacart Platform, the software offerings for grocery companies.
Ms. Simo had pitched working more closely with grocery retailers to Instacart's board before she started the job. She suggested that the company buy start-ups like Caper, which makes an electronic shopping cart that helps customers check off their grocery lists and lets retailers track their purchases, a person with knowledge of the conversations said. Instacart bought Caper in October 2021 for $ 350 million.
Grocers had long worried that Instacart would compete with them, but Ms. Simo emphasized that the company wanted to be a partner rather than a rival, retailers said.
"She is very powerful at affirming that message and has been very consistent in her actions over the past couple years," said Neil Stern, the chief executive of Good Food Holdings, which operates several regional grocery chains. He became an early tester of Instacart Platform after a series of Zoom meetings with Ms. Simo in the summer of 2021.
Instacart still faces challenges. The company relies heavily on a few large grocery retailers like Kroger and Costco for orders, leaving it vulnerable if one of those chains switched to a competitor.
Its grocery delivery business has also stagnated. In its prospectus, Instacart said grocery orders last year rose 18 percent, but that orders in the first half of this year were flat compared with a year earlier. That sluggishness could hamper its lucrative ads business if there are not enough delivery customers to show the ads to.
"The ads business only works because you have the core delivery business," said Nikhil Devnani, an analyst at Bernstein. "They're part and parcel with each other."

How to Navigate Apple’s Shift From Lightning to USB-C

SAN FRANCISCO — The iPhone 15 (technically, the 17th iteration of the iconic Apple phone) has arrived with a big change that is sure to annoy many of us. Eventually, however, we’ll breathe a sigh of relief.
Allow me to unpack that. To comply with recent European regulations, the iPhone 15, unveiled Tuesday, will abandon the Lightning connector that has been the method for charging iPhones for 11 years. In its place will be a different oval-shaped connector: USB-C.
For the average tech user, change isn’t fun. This all means that when Apple customers buy their next iPhones, they will no longer be able to plug in all the Lightning accessories they have collected, such as charging cables, speaker docks and earbuds. They will have to replace those with new products that use USB-C connectors to plug into the new iPhones.
This transition feels like a bit of déjà vu. In 2012, Apple killed the relatively bulky 30-pin connector on iPhones to switch to Lightning, a slimmer and faster charging technology, which rendered many speakers and chargers obsolete.
What’s different this time is that most of us already have a USB-C cable. Modern headphones, game consoles and many laptops, including Apple’s MacBooks, long ago adopted USB-C as a standard charging port. The iPhone was one of the holdouts.
Why is this happening now? Last year, the European Union announced a mandate requiring all smartphone makers to adopt USB-C as a common charging connector by 2024. In theory, this will allow consumers to buy fewer power cables, which, regulators say, could cut down on environmental waste. Thierry Breton, a European commissioner involved in the legislation, said on LinkedIn this month: “A common charger is common sense.”
So we are heading toward an era of standardization in which one type of charger works with most of our electronics, which would be ideal. Many of us are familiar with the scenario in which someone is carrying an iPhone cable but a family member or friend needs a different one (likely a USB-C) to replenish their non-Apple phone or computer. Those days, in theory, will be no more.
But as is always the case with any big technology shift, it’s not as simple as it sounds. New dangers lie ahead — including the ability to destroy your phone with the wrong USB-C wire, phone repair experts say. If you’re going to carry only one cable, it’s more important than ever to be judicious about what you buy.
“Charger damage is a real thing,” said Jessa Jones, the owner of iPad Rehab, a mobile phone and tablet repair shop. “It’s very common, and it’s something you need to watch out for.”
Here’s what to know:
Not all USB-C cables are created equal.
The first step is to stop thinking about modern charging cables as dumb wires.
High-quality chargers are essentially electronics with tiny circuit boards inside them. On Apple’s official Lightning cable, there are two chips: One authenticates that the cable is made by Apple, while the other acts as a fuse that isolates damage to the charger. In the event of a power fluctuation, for example, only the charger would be destroyed and not the phone itself, Jones said.
The problem with USB-C cables is that while they usually look the same, the cheaper, low-quality cords offer no such protection for your device. They may have the correct oval connector, but inside, they lack chips to protect your phone.
So if you need a USB-C cable, don’t grab any cheap wire, like the $5 ones you’ll see at a gas station kiosk. Invest in a durable cable from a reputable company. Brands such as Anker, Belkin and Amazon Basics are well known for their high-quality power cables that cost roughly $9 to $30, according to John Bumstead, the owner of RDKL Inc., a repair shop that refurbishes MacBooks. Buy the cables from trusted retailers or directly from the brands themselves — and avoid purchasing used wires on sites such as eBay.
Be careful what you plug into.
Many USB-C cables lack chips to restrict the current powering your phone. So if you plug it into a source that charges at a higher voltage than your phone accepts, you could electrocute your phone, Jones said.
The lesson here is to be careful about what you plug your cord into. Those USB ports embedded into airplane back seats, hotel room walls or car consoles are a big no-no because it’s unclear what their charging rates are. It’s safest to plug your USB-C cable only into a high-quality charging brick that protects your phone. Wirecutter, our sister publication, recommends USB-C power bricks from Anker, RAVPower and Spigen that do a good job replenishing your phone quickly without damaging it.
There’s always wireless.
For iPhone owners who aren’t planning on upgrading right away but need new chargers, the most cost-effective alternative to buying another Lightning cable is to go wireless. The EU mandate applies only to wires that plug directly into devices — not wireless charging devices that replenish your phone via magnetic induction, such as Apple’s puck-shaped MagSafe, which magnetizes to the back of your phone, or wireless charging pads and stands from brands such as Mophie, Anker and Belkin. So those are fine purchases for the foreseeable future.

Inflation Data Sends Market in Different Directions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street churned to a mixed finish on Wednesday after a highly anticipated report showed inflation accelerated across the country last month, but not by much more than expected.
The S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent after flipping between small gains and losses a few times through the day. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3 percent.
The modest moves followed a shaky immediate reaction to the inflation report across financial markets, where bond yields and stock prices swung back and forth several times. The report said consumers paid prices last month that were 3.7 percent higher than a year earlier, up from July's inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
Much of the acceleration was because of higher fuel costs, which can swing very sharply and quickly. Ignoring those, underlying inflation trends still look to be pointing toward continued moderation, economists said. Inflation has been generally cooling since peaking above 9 percent last year.
The inflation report was highly anticipated because it will help steer what the Federal Reserve does next on interest rates. The Fed has already raised its main rate to the highest level in more than two decades, which hurts prices for stocks and other investments, and the hope on Wall Street is that inflation has cooled enough for it to be done.
Wednesday's data likely keeps the Fed on track to keep rates steady at its meeting next week, said Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas.
But she also said expectations among traders on Wall Street for cuts to interest rates next year may be too aggressive. Such cuts can act like steroids for stocks and other investments, but inflation is still above the Fed's target of 2 percent.
"If anything, higher headline inflation is proof that the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer and that heavy rate cuts next year are mispriced," Ms. Chaudhuri said.
Even though economists are willing to ignore fuel costs when looking at inflation to find the underlying trends, households and companies don't get the same luxury.
Stocks of airlines were some of the biggest losers in the S&P 500 after a couple warned of the hit to profits they are taking because of higher costs.
American Airlines cut its forecast for profits during the summer because fuel costs are running higher than it expected. It also had to pay about $ 230 million in retroactive pay to pilots after they ratified a new labor contract. Its stock fell 5.7 percent.
Spirit Airlines said it was also paying higher fuel costs this summer than expected, roughly $ 3.06 per gallon instead of the $ 2.80 it had earlier forecast. It said it had also experienced steep discounting to fares during the last few weeks. That pushed it to cut its revenue forecast during the third quarter, and its stock fell 6.3 percent.
Other airlines also sank, including declines of 3.8 percent for United Airlines and 2.8 percent for Delta Air Lines.
On the winning end of Wall Street were high-growth stocks that could be big beneficiaries if the Fed is indeed done raising interest rates. High rates hurt all kinds of investments, but they often have an outsize impact on technology companies and others promising big growth far out in the future.
Amazon climbed 2.6 percent and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500. Microsoft gained 1.3 percent, and Nvidia rose 1.4 percent.
Moderna rallied 3.2 percent after it reported encouraging results from a trial of a flu vaccine.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.26 percent from 4.27 percent late Tuesday. It had swung as high as 4.34 percent immediately after the inflation report.
The two-year Treasury yield slipped to 4.99 percent from 5.02 percent late Tuesday.

Full text: Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles, 8:15 p.m., Amazon
Line: Eagles -7 | Total: 48.5
A short turnaround should be beneficial for both the Vikings (0-1) and the Eagles (1-0) as they look to rebound from sloppy Week 1 performances. Though the Eagles defeated the Patriots, 25-20, last week, Philadelphia allowed three sacks on Jalen Hurts, who also lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter.
The Vikings had three turnovers in the first half of last week's 20-17 loss to the Buccaneers. Receiver Justin Jefferson is likely to line up against the cornerback Darius Slay, which could limit his effectiveness, but Minnesota's defense is more likely to be the weak link in Thursday's game, when it will be tasked with guarding the receivers A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith. Expect the Eagles to start the season 2-0. Pick: Eagles -7

Macy's Names C.E.O.
For Bloomingdale's
Macy's named Olivier Bron, right, the next chief executive of Bloomingdale's, the company's luxury chain, on Tuesday, the latest move in a leadership shuffle this year.
Mr. Bron was previously chief executive of Central Group's Central and Robinson Department Stores in Thailand. He will start in November, succeeding Tony Spring. Macy's announced this year that Mr. Spring would be elevated to chief executive of Macy's in February after the planned retirement of Jeff Gennette, who has led the company since 2017.
Macy's has ambitions to become more competitive in e-commerce as younger shoppers pull away from department stores. Mr. Gennette previously said Bloomingdale's had worked as a "scrappy incubator" for ideas that made their way to Macy's.
Macy's, the largest department store chain in the United States, has been feeling pressure as consumers increasingly tighten their purse strings amid stubborn inflation. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Macy's said sales had dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. Bloomingdale's, which targets higher-earning shoppers, was less affected but still reported a 2.6 percent decline in sales.
Macy's also reported a "faster than expected" rise in credit card delinquencies.
"Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pull back on spend in our discretionary categories," Mr. Gennette told analysts in an Aug. 22 earnings call. "They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income with an ongoing shift to services and experiences." J. EDWARD MORENO
TECHNOLOGY
Eight More Companies
Pledge to Make A.I. Safe
The White House said on Tuesday that eight more companies involved in artificial intelligence had pledged to voluntarily follow standards for safety, security and trust with the fast-evolving technology.
The companies include Adobe, IBM, Palantir, Nvidia and Salesforce. They joined Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection AI, Microsoft and OpenAI, which initiated an industry-led effort on safeguards in an announcement with the White House in July. The companies have committed to testing and other security measures, which are not regulations and are not enforced by the government.
Grappling with A.I. has become paramount since OpenAI released the powerful ChatGPT chatbot last year. The technology has since been under scrutiny for affecting people's jobs, spreading misinformation and potentially developing its own intelligence.
On Wednesday, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Sundar Pichai of Google will be among a dozen tech executives meeting with lawmakers in a closed-door A.I. summit hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York.
"The president has been clear: Harness the benefits of A.I., manage the risks and move fast -- very fast," the White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, said in a statement. "And we are doing just that by partnering with the private sector and pulling every lever we have to get this done."
The companies agreed to include testing future products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot A.I.-generated material. They also agreed to share information about security risks across the industry and report any potential biases in their systems. CECILIA KANG

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In opening statements for the government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era, Google defended itself and said people had many choices for online search.
The Justice Department and 38 states and territories on Tuesday laid out how Google had systematically wielded its power in online search to cow competitors, as the internet giant fiercely parried back, in the opening of the most consequential trial over tech power in the modern internet era.
In a packed courtroom at the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse in Washington, the Justice Department and states painted a picture of how Google had used its deep pockets and dominant position, paying $ 10 billion a year to Apple and others to be the default search provider on smartphones. Google viewed those agreements as a "powerful strategic weapon" to cut out rivals and entrench its search engine, the government said.
"This feedback loop, this wheel, has been turning for more than 12 years," said Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead courtroom lawyer. "And it always turns to Google's advantage."
Google denied that it had illegally used agreements to exclude its search competitors and said it had simply provided a superior product, adding that people can easily switch which search engine they use. The company also said that internet search extends more broadly than its general search engine and pointed to the many ways that people now find information online, such as Amazon for shopping, TikTok for entertainment and Expedia for travel.

"Users today have more search options and more ways to access information online than ever before," said John E. Schmidtlein, the lawyer who opened for Google.
The back-and-forth came in the federal government's first monopoly trial since it tried to break up Microsoft more than two decades ago. This case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- is set to have profound implications not only for the internet behemoth but for a generation of other large tech companies that have come to influence how people shop, communicate, entertain themselves and work.
Over the next 10 weeks, the government and Google will present arguments and question dozens of witnesses, digging into how the company came to power and whether it broke the law to maintain and magnify its dominance. The final ruling, by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, could shift the balance of power in the tech industry, which is embroiled in a race over artificial intelligence that could transform and disrupt people's lives.
A government victory could set limits on Google and change its business practices, sending a humbling message to the other tech giants. If Google wins, it could act as a referendum on increasingly aggressive government regulators, raise questions about the efficacy of century-old antitrust laws and further embolden Silicon Valley.
"It is a test of whether our current antitrust laws -- the Sherman Act, written in 1890 -- can adapt to markets that are susceptible to monopolization in the 21st century," said Bill Baer, a former top antitrust official at the Justice Department, adding that Google was "indisputably powerful."
The case is part of a sweeping effort by the Biden administration and states to rein in the biggest tech companies. The Justice Department has filed a second lawsuit against Google over its advertising technology, which could go to trial as early as next year. The Federal Trade Commission is separately moving toward a trial in an antitrust lawsuit against Meta. Investigations remain open in efforts that could lead to antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Apple.
The Justice Department filed the case accusing Google of illegally maintaining its dominance in search in October 2020. Months later, a group of attorneys general from 35 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia filed their own lawsuit arguing that Google had abused its monopoly over search. Judge Mehta is considering both lawsuits during the trial.
The case centers on the agreements that Google reached with browser developers, smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers to use Google as the default search engine on their products. Since the lawsuit was filed, more than five million documents and depositions of more than 150 witnesses have been submitted to the court. Last month, Judge Mehta narrowed the scope of the trial, while allowing the core claims of monopoly abuse in search to remain.
The trial unfolded on Tuesday in Courtroom 10 at Washington's federal courthouse, a complex minutes from Capitol Hill. It drew a large crowd, with some people standing in line to enter as early as 4:30 a.m. Officials from the Google rivals Yelp and Microsoft also attended, as did dozens of attorneys and staff from the Justice Department, states and Google after years of work on the case.
Judge Mehta began the proceedings punctually. In the government's opening statement, Mr. Dintzer focused on the search agreements Google had struck with Apple and others. He referenced internal company documents that described how Google would not share revenue with Apple without "default placement" on its devices and how it worked to ensure that Apple couldn't redirect searches to its Siri assistant.
"Your honor, this is a monopolist flexing," Mr. Dintzer said.
In blunt language, Mr. Dintzer also argued that Google had tried to hide documents from antitrust enforcers by including lawyers on conversations and marking them as subject to attorney-client privilege. He showed a message from Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, asking for the chat history to be turned off in one conversation.
"They turned history off, your honor, so they could rewrite it here in this courtroom," Mr. Dintzer said.
William Cavanaugh, a lawyer for the states, echoed Mr. Dintzer's concerns about Google's agreements to become the default search engines on smartphones. He added that Google had limited a product used to place ads on other search engines to hurt Microsoft, which makes the Bing search engine.
In response, Mr. Schmidtlein, Google's lawyer, argued that the company's default agreements with browser makers don't lock up the market the way that the Justice Department said. Browser makers such as Apple and Mozilla both promote other search engines, he said, and it was easy for users to switch their default search engine.
Using a slide show, Mr. Schmidtlein demonstrated the number of taps or clicks required to change the default on popular smartphones. People who wished to switch their search engine but did not know how could search Google for instructions or watch a video tutorial on YouTube, which Google owns, he said.
The government's evidence was coming from "snippets and out-of-context" emails, he said.
The lawyers also sparred over whether Google was as dominant as the government claimed. The Justice Department and the states said Google competes primarily with broad search engines that act as a single place to look for multiple types of information. But Mr. Schmidtlein said Google's universe of competitors was wider, including online retailers like Amazon, food delivery apps like DoorDash and travel booking sites like Expedia.
In the afternoon, the Justice Department called Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, as its first witness to establish that the company had long been aware of its power in search and deliberately tried to sidestep antitrust scrutiny.
In more than three hours of testimony, Mr. Varian was asked about views that he shared with other Google employees on the power of defaults, the threat of Microsoft's entry into search and his awareness of language that could invite the attention of antitrust regulators. The Justice Department drew from Mr. Varian's emails and memos from as far back as the early 2000s.
Mr. Varian is scheduled to return to the witness stand on Wednesday.

TikTok Shop Aims to Turn Influencing Into Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company is beginning to introduce TikTok Shop to all of the app's users in the U.S., hoping to add a major new revenue stream.
TikTok wooed marketers from companies like Madewell, H&M and Gucci last Wednesday as part of New York Fashion Week, transforming the stylish East Village restaurant Cathédrale with a video wall showcasing fashion trends like "little luxuries" and tall mannequins wearing TikTok-inspired styles.
TikTok has cemented itself as an essential advertising venue for brands aiming to reach its young users. But at the party, the marketers were abuzz about TikTok's efforts to sell products from the app itself.
The reason: After nearly a year of testing, speculation and some internal upheaval, TikTok this week is rolling out TikTok Shop for all users in the United States. The company will expand the rollout of a Shop button on the app's home screen, which sends people to a marketplace, and drive traffic to videos that contain Shop buttons for specific products. Both enable users to buy products in a few clicks without leaving the app.
E-commerce is a significant bet for the company, which is hoping to translate the app's power as a cultural trendsetter into another big new revenue stream. But it is a venture that other popular social platforms, including Instagram, have not succeeded with in the United States.
To make it a hit, TikTok said, it is actively driving videos with shopping buttons into users' feed. The company is also, for the time being, giving generous discounts and coupons to users who shop and forgoing commissions from many sellers. TikTok said that it had already signed up 200,000 sellers to TikTok Shop and that more than 100,000 creators could make videos and livestream with shopping buttons.
"We have a very aggressive plan to make a splash in the industry and make sure that people out there understand that TikTok is a place for shopping," Nico Le Bourgeois, one of two executives overseeing TikTok Shop in the United States, said in an interview last week. "We'll be very present for Black Friday and Cyber Monday through a combination of traffic, free shipping and deals." He also said TikTok Shop would run ads on the web and elsewhere.
On Monday, TikTok's Shop button led to a page in the app with a vast array of items. Some were bizarre, like a 27-cent palm-size foldable chair and a $ 5.52 ice crusher with a hand crank. But there was also a section for verified brands like Revolve, Benefit Cosmetics and Otterbox, and products like Air Jordan sneakers.
In main TikTok feeds, creators are increasingly pitching products in videos that bear an orange Shop icon and the label "eligible for commission." People can buy the products with Apple Pay, PayPal or a credit card.
The Shop button, which now appears to 40 percent of users on the main bar of the app's home screen, started rolling out in August and will reach all of TikTok's 150 million U.S. users by early October.
An executive overhaul last month led to questions about the direction of U.S. e-commerce at the company. The person who oversaw the efforts, Sandie Hawkins, left the company for personal reasons, according to an internal memo. Mr. Le Bourgeois, who joined TikTok from Amazon, and Marni Levine, a retail executive who was most recently at Meta, replaced her in the role. They report to Bob Kang, the global e-commerce chief of the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok.
The company seems to have moved away from an initial focus on promoting shopping through livestreams, a huge industry in Asia that has not found the same resonance in North America, according to several marketers.
Craig Brommers, the chief marketing officer of the retailer American Eagle, said that when the chain tested live shopping events on TikTok in the past year, viewership was "well under what brands are experiencing in Asia-Pacific."
"The initial hypothesis was that live shopping would translate to North America -- we haven't seen that success," Mr. Brommers said. He said his company was keen to learn about other tools from TikTok Shop under its new leadership, especially if it could make it "seamless" for Gen Z shoppers to, say, watch TikTok creators in American Eagle jeans, then buy them in a few clicks.
Mr. Le Bourgeois and Ms. Levine said videos with shopping buttons from brands and creators were now TikTok Shop's main sales driver, though they said live shopping was still a priority and growing in the United States.
Creators who want to sell products from TikTok's marketplace must choose from the assortment of items TikTok has available. Alyssa Pannozzi, an indoor cycling trainer and TikTok personality with more than 200,000 followers, said that when she looked at the sea of products, many came from "foreign shops that have a hodgepodge of items."
The company has already run into accusations that it has enabled sales of shoddy or copyright-infringing products and has drawn comparisons to fast-growing Chinese shopping apps like Shein and Temu, which have flooded the market with cheap goods mailed straight from China.
TikTok's executives pushed back against such comparisons, saying it viewed itself more like Amazon or China's TMall and was using technology and manual moderation to enforce its policies, requiring "robust verification" for new sellers. The company said more than 90 percent of TikTok Shop's sellers were U.S.-based, and Mr. Le Bourgeois emphasized that a slew of major brands like Benefit, Olay, L'Oreal and e.l.f. had joined or were planning to join TikTok Shop.
Ms. Pannozzi, 37, said she was invited to join TikTok Shop a few months ago but largely ignored it until July, when she saw that her feed was flooded with QVC-style pitches and wondered if she could make money from those. She has tried to feature items from sellers with positive reviews that suit her followers -- like hair elastics and water bottles -- finding major success a few weeks ago with an advertorial video that passed more than two million views and led to over 600 sales of a Stanley-style tumbler. She said she expected to earn thousands of dollars in commissions and had joined an agency's invite-only program for TikTok Shop creators.
"Now, I'm getting a bunch of inquiries every morning when I wake up," she said. "TikTok to me now is completely different than it was a couple of months ago -- just the whole vibe of it," she added.
Paul Tran and Lynda Truong, the married founders of the South Korean skin care company Love & Pebble, attended TikTok's event with advertisers last week. They said in an interview that joining TikTok Shop this summer was "life changing," and that TikTok's offers for shoppers were generous.
Mr. Tran said the average price for the brand's core product -- a "beauty pops ice mask kit" for the face -- was about $ 39. While it was often selling for $ 7, or even $ 11, less on TikTok because of the app's discounts, he said he was still earning the same profit as he would from the standard price. Mr. Tran said he was not sure when TikTok might start taking a commission.
Ms. Levine said that TikTok could not elaborate on its future commission model but that it was "focused on getting the first of all the sellers to add their inventory to the platform."
"The name of the game is to keep people on the platform as well, whether that's through shopping, engagement of videos, whether it's through dances," Ms. Levine added. "It's always about keeping people engaged and being a part of the community."

Full text: A rally for Big Tech stocks on Monday helped Wall Street claw back about half its loss from last week.
The S&P 500 rose 29.97, or 0.7 percent, to 4,487.46, coming off its first losing week in the last three. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 87.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 34,663.72, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 156.37, or 1.1 percent, to 13,917.89.
Like last week, some big technology-oriented stocks led the way. Tesla jumped 10.1 percent, Amazon climbed 3.5 percent and Meta Platforms rose 3.2 percent.
Tech stocks were at the head of the line leading the market lower last week as yields climbed. Higher yields hurt all kinds of stocks, but high-growth stocks tend to be among the hardest hit. Yields rose last week after reports showed the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected, which could be adding more fuel to pressures keeping inflation high.
This upcoming week will offer a huge data point for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing whether to keep raising interest rates in its effort to get inflation back to 2 percent. On Wednesday, the U.S. government will offer the latest monthly update on prices consumers are paying across the economy, and the forecast is they were 3.6 percent higher in August than a year earlier.
The Fed has already hiked its main interest rate to the highest level in more than two decades, and it has said it will make coming moves based on how inflation and other parts of the economy perform. Inflation has come down from last year's peak above 9 percent, but economists warn the last bit of improvement to get to the Fed's target could be the most difficult to achieve.
With Fed officials no longer giving speeches ahead of their meeting next week on interest rates, "the data will do all of the talking this week," economists at Deutsche Bank said in a report.
Those economists say a report on Thursday about inflation at the wholesale level will be nearly as important as the data on inflation at the consumer level. High growth for wages in the health care industry could be pushing upward on inflation there, they say.
A separate report on Thursday will also show how much U.S. households spent at retailers last month. Strong spending there recently has helped the economy avoid a long-predicted recession. But it also could encourage companies to keep trying to raise prices, pushing upward on inflation.
Yields held relatively steady on Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield up to 4.28 percent from 4.26 percent late Friday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, rose to 5.00 percent after drifting through the day, up slightly from 4.99 percent late Friday.
Most traders expect the Federal Reserve to leave rates where they are at its meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. But many are bracing for another possible hike by the end of this year, while paring expectations for cuts to rates next year.
On Wall Street, Charter Communications rose 3.2 percent after it announced a deal with The Walt Disney Co. to restore access to ESPN and other channels to its Spectrum video customers. Disney rose 1.2 percent.
Apple rose 0.7 percent ahead of a Tuesday event where it's expected to release its latest iPhone model. How Apple performs has great consequence for the market because it's the most valuable stock on Wall Street. That means its movements pack more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than any other stock.
Qualcomm rose 3.9 percent after it announced a deal to supply 5G equipment for Apple in its phone launches in 2024 through 2026.
Hostess Brands jumped 19.1 percent after J.M. Smucker said it will buy the maker of Twinkies and HoHos in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $ 5.6 billion, including $ 900 million of net debt. J.M. Smucker slumped 7 percent.

Guide to Key Figures Inside the Courtroom At an Antitrust Trial: [National Desk]

Full text: The federal government's first monopoly trial this century will feature top tech executives, experienced litigators and an Obama-appointed judge.
A trial to determine if Google abused its monopoly in online search, which begins on Tuesday, is set to lay bare how the internet search giant cemented its power, featuring testimony from top tech executives, engineers, economists and academics.
The trial will unfold in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where a core group of individuals will command the courtroom and direct the day-to-day legal strategies. Here are the key people to know in U.S. et al. v. Google:
From federal court
Judge Amit P. Mehta
Judge Mehta, who was appointed to the bench in 2014 by President Barack Obama, will referee and decide the case in the nonjury trial.
In more than three years of pretrial hearings, Judge Mehta hasn't tipped his hand on his views of the case. In a proceeding last month, he narrowed the lawsuit by the Justice Department and states while preserving the core argument that Google maintained its monopoly in search through deals with smartphone makers that cut out competitors.
Judge Mehta, 52, was randomly assigned to U.S. et al. v. Google. He may be more familiar with Google than other federal judges, whose average age reached 69 in 2020, according to a study at the time by The Ohio State Law Journal. He received his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1997, a year before Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google.
Judge Mehta previously worked in private practice in San Francisco and Washington, focusing on white-collar criminal defense, complex business disputes and appellate advocacy.
For the plaintiffs
Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general for antitrust at the Justice Department
Mr. Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, is overseeing the government's case.
President Biden appointed Mr. Kanter, a longtime tech and media lawyer who received his law degree from Washington University in St. Louis, to the Justice Department in July 2021. Mr. Kanter is among a group of progressive Big Tech critics whom Mr. Biden has placed in top government positions for antitrust enforcement. He inherited the Google case from the Trump administration.
Mr. Kanter, 50, is also overseeing a separate antitrust lawsuit against Google in the ad tech market. Google has raised concerns that his history of representing its rivals, including Microsoft and News Corp, makes him biased, and the company has protested his involvement in the ad tech case.
It's unclear how often Mr. Kanter will appear in court. Doha Mekki, the Justice Department's principal deputy assistant attorney general, and Hetal Doshi, the deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust, have helped quarterback the lawsuit and will be in the courtroom daily.
Kenneth Dintzer, a deputy director in the civil division of the Justice Department
Mr. Dintzer, a 30-year veteran of the Justice Department, will give opening statements and is leading the government's case in the courtroom.
A graduate of the University of Michigan law school, Mr. Dintzer, 59, was assigned to the Google case during the Trump administration. He has argued in pretrial hearings before Judge Mehta that Google destroyed instant messages "depriving" the department "of a rich source of candid discussions between Google's executives, including likely trial witnesses."
He has worked on antitrust cases in the past, including the Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&T's proposed merger with T-Mobile in 2011. The companies eventually dropped the deal.
Philip J. Weiser, Colorado's attorney general
Mr. Weiser is overseeing a coalition of 38 state and other attorneys generals that joined the Justice Department in its search lawsuit.
Mr. Weiser, 55, a former deputy assistant attorney general of antitrust at the Justice Department for the Obama administration, has been a vocal critic of big tech companies for stifling competition. After graduating from New York University Law School, he became a counsel to Joel Klein, the Justice Department's head of antitrust during the agency's Microsoft monopoly lawsuit in the 1990s. He didn't work directly on the case but said in an interview that it had influenced him.
Mr. Weiser has picked Jonathan Sallet, a former deputy head of antitrust at the Justice Department, and William Cavanaugh, a lawyer at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and a former Justice Department official, as the lead litigators for the states.
For the defense
Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive
Mr. Pichai, the chief executive of Google, is widely expected to testify during the trial.
He joined Google in 2004 as a product management leader of Chrome and other tools, and was named chief executive in August 2015.
A measured and calm speaker who has at times been called boring, Mr. Pichai, 51, was largely unruffled when testifying in congressional hearings over content moderation and antitrust in recent years. That may serve him well in the trial.
Google's founders, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, aren't expected to be called as witnesses. But the Justice Department and Google are likely to call other tech executives to testify, including Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, to discuss the company's search deals with Google.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs
Mr. Walker, Google's president of global affairs and chief legal counsel, is overseeing the company's defense.
Mr. Walker, 62, received his law degree from Stanford and joined Google in 2006. He led Google's policy and legal strategy through an antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that began in 2009. The agency decided not to proceed with a lawsuit after the company agreed to some changes.
Mr. Walker is overseeing a big team of in-house and outside lawyers and will be in and out of the courtroom. Google's daily legal representative in the courtroom, who has supervised strategy on the case, is Lara Kollios, a director in regulatory response and investigations.
John E. Schmidtlein, partner at Williams & Connolly
Mr. Schmidtlein, a co-chair of antitrust at Williams & Connolly, is Google's lead lawyer in the courtroom.
Google has turned to lawyers like Mr. Schmidtlein, 57, who fought against Microsoft in antitrust cases two decades ago, to defend it in court. In 2002, Mr. Schmidtlein represented states that sued Microsoft for using its dominance in Windows software to block rival media players.
Mr. Schmidtlein, who received his law degree from Georgetown University, also has a long track record working for tech companies. This year, he helped Amazon defeat an antitrust lawsuit that consumers brought against its logistics practices.
Google's litigation team also includes Susan Creighton, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati who represented Netscape in the government's 1998 antitrust suit against Microsoft, and Mark Popofsky, a partner at Ropes & Gray who was a senior counsel to the Justice Department in that suit against Microsoft.

Full text: The government claims that Google illegally stifles rivals, while the company says its practices are legal and mainstream.
A federal judge will start hearing claims this week from the Justice Department and a group of states that Google abused its power as a monopoly over online search services.
Google is synonymous with looking for information online and has leveraged its massively successful search tool to build a giant business spanning advertising, cloud computing and the online video powerhouse YouTube.
The outcome of the trial will have even broader implications than Google's business. By putting decades of Silicon Valley practices under the microscope, it will provide an indication of how successful regulators in the United States will be in their efforts to rein in the power of Big Tech.
What's this trial about?
A judge will consider whether, as the Justice Department and a group of states argue, Google abused its power as a monopoly. It's the first monopoly trial against a tech giant since the landmark proceedings against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
In the decades since, Google has amassed 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.
Why does it matter?
If Google loses this case, the ruling could chip away at its stature and influence in the technology industry -- something that could limit the way Google can compete in the marketplace and reshuffle power in Silicon Valley.
It is also a test for governments that say tech giants like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, have too much influence over our online lives. The nation's antitrust laws were first written more than a century ago, and this trial will show whether they can be used to rein in the fast-moving tech industry.
What, exactly, is Google accused of doing?
The Justice Department has accused Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., of illegally using partnerships with phone makers and internet browser companies to shut out rival search engines.
Thanks to agreements with companies like Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, Google has been the default search engine when billions of web users open a browser on their phones, tablets and personal computers. The government has argued that Google's multibillion-dollar payouts to partners have prevented other search engines like Microsoft Bing and DuckDuckGo from accumulating a meaningful share of the online search market.
The Justice Department also claims Google's practice of preloading its services on devices that use its Android software illegally helped the internet company maintain a monopoly.
What does Google say?
Google says that its business practices are legal and commonplace, and that when it pays to appear on Apple's Safari browser or Mozilla's Firefox, the agreement is akin to a maker of cereals paying supermarkets to stock its boxes at eye level.
The search giant has also repeatedly argued that it has numerous successful competitors in online search. The company points to companies like Amazon and TikTok as thriving competitors. Even though they do not operate general-purpose search engines, Google argues that they are rival destinations where consumers go to find products or content that bypasses Google entirely.
Google has also said that the government is using a flawed argument to target the company because of its popularity. The company believes it is successful because it makes the best search engine. Consumers have a choice to use other search engines, it argues, but choose Google because they find it most helpful.
What does the government need to prove to win its case?
The government has to show that Google has monopoly power over the areas of the economy at issue in the case. The government will try to convince the judge to take a relatively strict view of what a search engine is and to reject Google's argument that e-commerce sites like Amazon and social media services like TikTok or Instagram are in the same market as Google's search engine. The wider the market, the easier it is for Google to argue that it does not have monopoly power.
The government also needs to prove that Google's commercial agreements meaningfully reduced competition among search engines by denying them a chance to forge similar deals with device makers or gain new customers. The Justice Department will also probably have to explain how these business practices directly or indirectly harmed consumers, which has for decades been an important bar for judges considering antitrust cases.
What will happen if Google is found responsible for violating the law?
The trial will have two parts. First, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will determine if Google violated the law. If it did, then Judge Mehta will consider possible ways to fix the situation.
The Justice Department has not yet said what actions it would ask the court to impose on Google in the event of its victory.
"But it all starts with the court being convinced that Google has misbehaved," said Bill Baer, a former Justice Department official.
Google's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, highlighted the challenge of finding an appropriate remedy without forcing other companies that are not being sued, including Apple and Samsung, to change their business practices.
It is possible that the Justice Department will ask that Google be forbidden from signing exclusive distribution agreements to give other search engines more prominence on consumer devices.
What's the broader context surrounding the trial?
The Justice Department's case against Google focuses on whether the tech giant engaged in anticompetitive conduct to undermine other search engines, which rival the service that made the company a household name.
In the decades since Microsoft was accused of bundling its products together to prevent other web browsers from gaining traction in the market, the technology industry has drastically changed.
Google has emerged as the largest advertising business on the internet. Along with its success has come intensifying scrutiny from regulators around the world, questioning the company's business practices and the competitive, political and social consequences of its popular products.
The European Union has been the most aggressive at trying to rein in Google's power, and this case is the first in which the United States will square off against the company.

Surreal Adventures and Cute-Robot Charm: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include cute-robot charm and alien abduction angst.
'Shin Ultraman'
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
From the start, it's obvious that this is not a regular Kaiju movie. The genre, in which gigantic beasts à la Godzilla lay waste to cities and swaths of countryside, is not known for restraint, but "Shin Ultraman" is completely, unpredictably off the wall.
Captain Tamura (Hidetoshi Nishijima, from the radically different "Drive My Car") leads a task force dedicated to fighting the big monsters that turn up with clockwork regularity. "For some reason, Kaiju only appear in Japan," someone quips about the creatures's absence elsewhere in the world. But even this elite squad is flabbergasted when a mysterious helmeted giant clad in a superhero-like red and silver bodysuit shows up. Called Ultraman (a popular character who has been the subject of many iterations since its introduction in 1966), the newcomer helps the overwhelmed team battle aliens like Mefilas (Koji Yamamoto).
Both a reboot and a riff, "Shin Ultraman," which was directed by Shinji Higuchi and written by Hideaki Anno (the pair also collaborated on "Shin Godzilla" in 2016), is a surreal trip. It's hard to oversell the eye-popping invention and droll humor on display here, but it's Higuchi's mise en scène that stands out, packed with odd angles and seemingly arbitrary shots, as when a character opens a computer file and the movie cuts to her feet under her desk. Shiro Sagisu's score is equally bonkers and disruptive, incorporating 1960s pop, thrash riffs, chamber suites and jazzy noodlings. It all amounts to pure joy.
'Tang and Me'
Stream it on Amazon.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Chances are you haven't heard of Deborah Install's "A Robot in the Garden" (2015), unless you live in Japan, where the novel has been adapted into a radio play, a stage musical and now this charming kid-friendly movie.
Ken (Kazunari Ninomiya) has a terminal case of arrested development, whiling away his days playing elaborate virtual-reality games and avoiding any hint of household work. One day, a rusty, taped-up robot turns up in the garden, offering its name as Tang. Shortly thereafter, Ken's fed-up wife, Emi (Hikari Mitsushima), kicks him out of their house. So he sets out for Atobit Systems, the company that manufactured Tang, to trade that old model for a brand-new one, which he will then give to Emi to get back in her graces.
The latest from the prolific director Takahiro Miki ("The Door Into Summer") does not revolutionize the cute-robot genre, but it is very effective. Naturally, Ken will change for the best, thanks to Tang -- whose mysterious origin and initial purpose are at the heart of the story -- but this utter predictability is a feature, not a bug, and is embraced as such by the film. Young viewers are likely to clamor for a toy version of the adorable bot, while their parents are more likely to be interested in the movie's awfully believable near-future, in which delivery drones crisscross the sky and robots are absolutely everywhere in our daily life.
'Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I Feel Kinda Left Out'
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When the Levan family moves to a quaint Western town, the teenage Itsy (the excellent Emma Tremblay) is not especially pleased: She is now living in the middle of nowhere, plus being singled out as the new kid is never fun. Maybe that's why she immediately connects with her new classmate Calvin (Jacob Buster, a charmer bound to resurface in bigger-budget projects), who is ostracized as the local weirdo. Calvin is a heartthrob in nerd clothing -- more specifically in a spacesuit, which he is prone to wear to school -- and is on a quest to find the parents (Will Forte and Elizabeth Mitchell) he hasn't seen in 10 years. He is convinced they were taken by aliens one fateful night and has been searching the skies ever since. Itsy pretends to befriend him for a journalism project, though it's clear she's actually taken by Calvin's quirky sincerity, and perhaps even by his far-fetched story about extraterrestrial creatures secretly visiting Earth whenever a certain comet gets close.
Jake Van Wagoner's film is a throwback to 1980s family-friendly fare, and it nicely captures the formula's basic elements, down to the presence of a smart-aleck little boy (Itsy's brother, Evan, played by Kenneth Cummins), an unironic embrace of the cutesy and the cheesy in equal proportions and, perhaps most important, a general good nature.
'Life Cycle'
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Carl (Adam Weber) lives in his grandparents' rec-room-like basement, seems to survive on power bars and takeout, and watches old black-and-white movies on an ancient-looking TV set. The only other living presence in that den is Vetro (voiced by Kory Karam), an animatronic head with enormous blue eyes sitting on Carl's desk. A computer programmer, Carl is ambitious: "You are to become human," he informs his creation. To that end, Vetro has been endowed with the ability to generate "new expansions." In other words, he is sentient and can upgrade himself. One of his first moves is to give himself a new "multilayered emotional matrix," and it doesn't take long for Vetro to exhibit somewhat cunning traits -- he can be both obsequious and creepy.
The writer-director Christopher Morvant's most distinctive spin on the thriving A.I. genre was to make Vetro a cartoonish animatronic/puppet character that looks goofy yet comes across as unsettling, especially since Morvant often shows him in startling close-ups. The movie is, admittedly, overlong, especially since it's essentially a talkathon between Carl and Vetro, and the writing is not quite strong enough to sustain the more complex philosophical issues it raises. But "Life Cycle" does have a few surprises in store, and Morvant's sui generis world nimbly juxtaposes technologies that feel pulled from completely different eras. Pretty good for a movie shot in a garage in a month.
'Dry Ground Burning'
Rent or buy it on Amazon.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Set in an impoverished Sol Nascente, in Brazil, Joana Pimenta and Adirley Queirós's film is tough to categorize. "Dry Ground Burning" follows the activities of a women's gang, led by Chitara (Joana Darc Furtado), that steals oil and resells it as gas to groups of bikers. Add to that mix the re-entry into society of Chitara's half sister, Léa (Léa Alves da Silva), who is newly released from prison. In conventional hands, these could be an action-packed thriller's starting point. Pimenta and Queirós go down a completely different road, both in form and in content.
We are in a dystopian pamphlet targeting the far-right policies of Brazil's authoritarian former president Jair Bolsonaro, which were devastating for the poor, the minorities and the outcasts at the movie's heart. All of this is put together with a documentarylike matter-of-factness, increased by the fact that the cast is made up of non- or semiprofessional actors. When scenes set during, say, a raucous bus trip or a religious ceremony hypnotically go on and on as if in real time, you might wonder if Frederick Wiseman had suddenly gone to Brazil. Tip: Go with the flow -- you can't rush life, politics or this film.

TikTok Popularizes Products. Can It Sell Them, Too?

TikTok wooed marketers from companies like Madewell, H&M and Gucci on Wednesday as part of New York Fashion Week, transforming the stylish East Village restaurant Cathédrale with a video wall showcasing fashion trends like “little luxuries” and tall mannequins wearing TikTok-inspired styles.
TikTok has cemented itself as an essential advertising venue for brands aiming to reach its young users. But at the party, the marketers were abuzz about TikTok’s efforts to sell products from the app itself.
The reason: After nearly a year of testing, speculation and some internal upheaval, TikTok this week is rolling out TikTok Shop for all users in the United States. The company will expand the rollout of a Shop button on the app’s home screen, which sends people to a marketplace, and drive traffic to videos that contain Shop buttons for specific products. Both enable users to buy products in a few clicks without leaving the app.
E-commerce is a significant bet for the company, which is hoping to translate the app’s power as a cultural trendsetter into another big new revenue stream. But it is a venture that other popular social platforms, including Instagram, have not succeeded with in the United States.
To make it a hit, TikTok said, it is actively driving videos with shopping buttons into users’ feed. The company is also, for the time being, giving generous discounts and coupons to users who shop and forgoing commissions from many sellers. TikTok said that it had already signed up 200,000 sellers to TikTok Shop and that more than 100,000 creators could make videos and livestream with shopping buttons.
“We have a very aggressive plan to make a splash in the industry and make sure that people out there understand that TikTok is a place for shopping,” Nico Le Bourgeois, one of two executives overseeing TikTok Shop in the United States, said in an interview last week. “We’ll be very present for Black Friday and Cyber Monday through a combination of traffic, free shipping and deals.” He also said TikTok Shop would run ads on the web and elsewhere.
On Monday, TikTok’s Shop button led to a page in the app with a vast array of items. Some were bizarre, like a 27-cent palm-size foldable chair and a $5.52 ice crusher with a hand crank. But there was also a section for verified brands like Revolve, Benefit Cosmetics and Otterbox, and products like Air Jordan sneakers.
In main TikTok feeds, creators are increasingly pitching products in videos that bear an orange Shop icon and the label “eligible for commission.” People can buy the products with Apple Pay, PayPal or a credit card.
The Shop button, which now appears to 40% of users on the main bar of the app’s home screen, started rolling out in August and will reach all of TikTok’s 150 million U.S. users by early October.
An executive overhaul last month led to questions about the direction of U.S. e-commerce at the company. The person who oversaw the efforts, Sandie Hawkins, left the company for personal reasons, according to an internal memo. Le Bourgeois, who joined TikTok from Amazon, and Marni Levine, a retail executive who was most recently at Meta, replaced her in the role. They report to Bob Kang, the global e-commerce chief of the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok.
The company seems to have moved away from an initial focus on promoting shopping through livestreams, a huge industry in Asia that has not found the same resonance in North America, according to several marketers.
Craig Brommers, the chief marketing officer of the retailer American Eagle, said that when the chain tested live shopping events on TikTok in the past year, viewership was “well under what brands are experiencing in Asia-Pacific.”
“The initial hypothesis was that live shopping would translate to North America — we haven’t seen that success,” Brommers said. He said his company was keen to learn about other tools from TikTok Shop under its new leadership, especially if it could make it “seamless” for Gen Z shoppers to, say, watch TikTok creators in American Eagle jeans, then buy them in a few clicks.
Le Bourgeois and Levine said videos with shopping buttons from brands and creators were now TikTok Shop’s main sales driver, though they said live shopping was still a priority and growing in the United States.
Creators who want to sell products from TikTok’s marketplace must choose from the assortment of items TikTok has available. Alyssa Pannozzi, an indoor cycling trainer and TikTok personality with more than 200,000 followers, said that when she looked at the sea of products, many came from “foreign shops that have a hodgepodge of items.”
The company has already run into accusations that it has enabled sales of shoddy or copyright-infringing products and has drawn comparisons to fast-growing Chinese shopping apps like Shein and Temu, which have flooded the market with cheap goods mailed straight from China.
TikTok’s executives pushed back against such comparisons, saying it viewed itself more like Amazon or China’s TMall and was using technology and manual moderation to enforce its policies, requiring “robust verification” for new sellers. The company said more than 90% of TikTok Shop’s sellers were U.S.-based, and Le Bourgeois emphasized that a slew of major brands like Benefit, Olay, L’Oreal and e.l.f. had joined or were planning to join TikTok Shop.
Pannozzi, 37, said she was invited to join TikTok Shop a few months ago but largely ignored it until July, when she saw that her feed was flooded with QVC-style pitches and wondered if she could make money from those. She has tried to feature items from sellers with positive reviews that suit her followers — like hair elastics and water bottles — finding major success a few weeks ago with an advertorial video that passed more than 2 million views and led to more than 600 sales of a Stanley-style tumbler. She said she expected to earn thousands of dollars in commissions and had joined an agency’s invite-only program for TikTok Shop creators.
“Now, I’m getting a bunch of inquiries every morning when I wake up,” she said. “TikTok to me now is completely different than it was a couple of months ago — just the whole vibe of it,” she added.
Paul Tran and Lynda Truong, the married founders of South Korean skin care company Love & Pebble, attended TikTok’s event with advertisers last week. They said in an interview that joining TikTok Shop this summer was “life changing,” and that TikTok’s offers for shoppers were generous.
Tran said the average price for the brand’s core product — a “beauty pops ice mask kit” for the face — was about $39. While it was often selling for $7, or even $11, less on TikTok because of the app’s discounts, he said he was still earning the same profit as he would from the standard price. Tran said he was not sure when TikTok might start taking a commission.
Levine said that TikTok could not elaborate on its future commission model but that it was “focused on getting the first of all the sellers to add their inventory to the platform.”
“The name of the game is to keep people on the platform as well, whether that’s through shopping, engagement of videos, whether it’s through dances,” Levine added. “It’s always about keeping people engaged and being a part of the community.”

The Justice Department argues in a federal antitrust suit that Google is a dominant tech company that has abused its market power to bully industry partners, protect its monopoly and thwart competition.
That has a familiar ring. As U.S. et al. v. Google goes to trial this week, the echoes of the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, a quarter-century ago, are unmistakable. In the Google case, as with Microsoft then, a tech giant is accused of using its overwhelming market power to unfairly cut competitors off from potential customers.
But on the eve of the Google trial, it seems unimaginable that the case could command the widespread attention that the Microsoft proceedings did. Microsoft in the late 1990s was a singular tech titan and its leader, Bill Gates, was a national icon.
The Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998, spanned 76 days of testimony over more than eight months. Every major news organization covered it. The New York Times reported on the proceedings daily.
It was a trial that often dealt with cerebral concepts such as “network effects” and “switching costs.” Yet the Times gave it the kind of day-to-day coverage ordinarily reserved for very few courtroom dramas over the years, such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the Lindbergh kidnapping trial.
Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself.
Microsoft was found by a federal judge to have repeatedly violated the nation’s antitrust laws. An appeals court upheld most of that decision but was skeptical of the government’s preferred remedy — breaking up the company.
In its lawsuit against Google, the Justice Department points to the Microsoft case and that company’s tactics in the 1990s. “Google deploys the same playbook,” the government declares, by illegally wielding its might in online search much as Microsoft did with its personal computer operating system, Windows.
But Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs, said there were big differences between the Microsoft of the dot-com boom and today’s Google. Back then, Walker was deputy general counsel of Netscape, the commercial pioneer of internet browsing software, which was the main target of Microsoft’s campaign to hobble competition.
About 90% of personal computers used Microsoft’s Windows software, the main gateway to the young internet, and Microsoft controlled the software and services that were featured on those Windows PC screens.
Google, on the other hand, has to work with and pay partners that make smartphones, browsers and other devices, Walker said. Its deals with companies such as Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on their smartphones are legal and benefit consumers, giving them the best technology and reducing costs for device makers and their customers, he said.
“We think there are aspects of the Microsoft case that are actually very helpful to us here,” Walker said in an interview.
When the Microsoft trial started, it was the high tide of early internet euphoria. E-commerce was just getting underway, and every industry wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon. This was before mobile computing. The first BlackBerry, essentially an email device, was introduced in 1999. The iPhone, which started the smartphone era, didn’t arrive until 2007. If you wanted to get online, chances are you did it through a computer that ran Windows.
Microsoft was rich, powerful and ambitious. It had started to move beyond software. In 1996, it entered the media business in a partnership with NBC, setting up the cable channel, MSNBC, and a website, msnbc.com (Microsoft shed its stakes in both, years later).
Executives in industry after industry worried about what Microsoft might do next, sharing a sentiment expressed by Rupert Murdoch, chair of News Corp: “Everybody in the communications business is paranoid of Microsoft, including me.”
Today, Google does not loom as large as Microsoft once did. It is one member of the Big Tech club. It is an undisputed giant in search and online advertising, and its software and artificial intelligence prowess can extend to other industries. But its Big Tech peers — Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and even Microsoft — are all under scrutiny in the United States and abroad.
The Microsoft case also had a huge personal dimension because of the stature of Gates. He was the world’s richest person, and during the course of the trial, as the stock market surged, Gates’ stake in Microsoft soared to $100 billion. In 1995, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a website, called the Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock, to track Gates’ net worth.
Gates was widely admired as a brilliant entrepreneur, polls showed. He was Microsoft’s leader, deeply involved in company operations and especially its internet strategy. He viewed the government’s antitrust pursuit as an assault on his life’s work, colleagues said.
Gates was not a witness at the trial, but excerpts from his videotaped deposition testimony were shown. He was quibbling, unresponsive and forgetful. At one point, he seemed not to understand the term “market share.” (The joke immediately afterward was that “share” was the concept he didn’t grasp.)
Later, Microsoft officials said Gates had merely been following legal advice he was given to narrow questions and avoid broad or responsive answers. If so, it was bad advice. His deposition testimony undermined his credibility — and Microsoft’s — with the judge.
Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, have a far less prominent role in the current case. They are no longer deeply involved in the company. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is a thoughtful, soft-spoken company man who joined Google in 2004 and rose through the ranks.
Although the legal theory advanced by the Justice Department mirrors the one used in the Microsoft case, the outcome of the trial will hinge on the evidence presented to Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The government has already suggested its evidence will lack the vivid language of the Microsoft case. There is no equivalent of “cut off Netscape’s air supply” or piles of email filled with no-holds-barred terminology.
In the Google suit, the government cited the search company’s instructions to its employees to avoid words such as “kill,” “crush” and “block” in their emails.
“Google did learn one thing from Microsoft — to choose its words carefully to avoid antitrust scrutiny,” the Justice Department wrote.
For its part, the government has understandably borrowed heavily from the Microsoft case in its lawsuit against Google because those legal theories “worked so well against Microsoft,” said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
After the George W. Bush administration came to power, the Justice Department and Microsoft reached a settlement. The resulting consent decree prohibited Microsoft from imposing restrictive contracts, freed PC makers to load and feature other companies’ software and forced Microsoft to disclose more technical information.
Many people criticized the consent decree as toothless. David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, was initially a critic, but his views had changed.
Today, Yoffie teaches a course on antitrust and technology, and it begins with the Microsoft consent decree. “There were a litany of actions that were no longer possible because of the consent decree,” he said. “It did limit Microsoft’s ability to go after newcomers, not ones trying to compete with Microsoft head-on but at an angle.”
The leading beneficiary of the more open environment, Yoffie said, was an internet search startup, with new technology and later a new business model. It was called Google. It was founded in September 1998, one month before the Microsoft trial began.

Full text: A googol, the number for which Google is named, is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. At $ 1.7 trillion, the company's valuation is far from that large, but it's closer than the market cap of almost every other tech competitor.
The biggest U.S. antitrust case in 25 years, set to begin this week, strikes at the heart of the empire that Alphabet, Google's parent company, built over decades.
Alphabet hit a $ 1 trillion market cap in January 2020, a milestone that only Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have also reached. At the time, Alphabet was facing several different legal and regulatory challenges -- but this latest court battle is its most significant yet.
Google will go head to head with the Justice Department and a group of states, which argue that the tech giant illegally abused its agreements with phone makers and browsers to become the default search engine, quashing its rivals.
Those monopolistic practices are how Google got so big, the government says, as the company became synonymous with looking up information on the web. Google has cornered 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to one data analysis firm.
At the helm of Google's legal strategy is Kent Walker, a top lawyer at the company for almost 20 years. He says he will argue that Google's partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung are lawful and that consumers should have easy access to the services they like most.
But if Google loses the case, the company could be forced to pay damages and limit its search distribution deals, leading to fewer users and a drop in its robust profits. And not only could a ruling against Google sap it of its power and influence, the case could also have a ripple effect on other large internet companies that have enjoyed decades of almost unfettered growth.
"It's definitely a lifestyle associated with him and his personality and his music that he created."
Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, who said Jimmy Buffett's carefree tropical brand could last beyond his death.

David Tolley, who took over as chief executive at the co-working company WeWork, which still has hundreds of locations despite its implosion in 2019.
"Higher oil prices will only increase the likelihood of more fiscal tightening, especially in the U.S., to curtail inflation."

A New Narrative Replaces the Angels: [Style Desk]

Full text: The lingerie brand introduces a feature-length film meant to be the final piece of its reinvention.
The last time Victoria's Secret had a fashion show was 2018.
For more than 20 years, the show had been an annual event, an extravaganza of babes in thongland, like "Barbie" through the lens of Paul Verhoeven. Broadcast in more than 100 countries to millions of viewers, it got evermore absurdist until the #MeToo movement and social change finally brought the curtain down along with the profits, leaving the company wrestling with just how out of step with women's sense of self it had become.
The company retired the signature angels in their push-up bras and panties toting around ginormous 30-pound wings and replaced them with the VS Collective: a group of 10 women of notable accomplishments and notably diverse body types. It announced that it wanted to be "the world's leading advocate for women." And then, on Wednesday, Victoria's Secret finally brought back the show.
Sort of.
There was a powder pink carpet with a marquee outside the Manhattan Center on 34th Street in Manhattan, with Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Lourdes Leon, Alix Earle and assorted models in skimpy outfits posing for paparazzi. There were gawkers outside wielding smartphones, and champagne inside, where all was bathed in a soft pink light. There was Naomi Campbell in a gold chain-mail minidress and Gigi Hadid in sunshine jersey, elevated above the crowd on V.I.P. balconies. There was Doechii, serenading the room and twerking in a lilac corset and matching thigh-high boots. There was even a glittering pair of wings. So far, so familiar.
But there was no runway. Ms. Campbell, it turned out, was there to recite a poem by the Nigerian writer and artist Eloghosa Osunde. Doechii shared the stage with Goyo, a singer from Bogotá, Colombia, who entered for her set wearing a crop top and skirt made from a cobweb of curving, glittering crochet by the Bogotá designer Melissa Valdés. The wings were positioned in a special circular room, outside of which snaked a line of guests waiting to take selfies, as if to document a relic from another age.
And Ms. Hadid was holding a microphone to introduce the evening's main event: a 12-minute trailer for a one-and-a-half-hour film that is intended to be the final piece of the VS reinvention pie.
"The Victoria's Secret World Tour," which will stream on Amazon Prime on Sept. 26, is a putting-their-platform-where-their-mouth-is movie conceived to showcase the work of "a new generation of creatives" (all female, of course) from four major cities -- Lagos, Nigeria; London; Bogotá; and Tokyo -- the better to convince the world that this really is a new Victoria's Secret.
"To finally say, 'This is it, this is who we are,"' said Raul Martinez, the brand's chief creative director. "We haven't forgotten our past, but we're also speaking to the present. To take our platform, understand the power of that, but show up with a different narrative."
Which is what, exactly?
A mishmash of good intentions, enormous investment, a year and a half of work and multiple parts that will indubitably introduce new talents to an audience who might otherwise never have heard of them. But also a mess. And not necessarily a hot one.
To be fair, that was probably part of the point. "Hot" is an association the new Victoria's Secret would rather stay far away from. Mostly.
Going on "Tour"
Grounded by five different mini fashion shows by five different designers from around the world whose collections were almost all brought to Spain and filmed in the Corberó building, a masterpiece of Brutalist concrete arches in Barcelona, the flick in its full incarnation features a diverse cast of models -- Adut Akech, Lila Moss Hack, Honey Dijon, Julia Fox and Yseult among them -- as well as some former angels making a return to earth, like Adriana Lima and Candice Swanepoel.
Ms. Hadid plays a silk-robe-clad M.C. trying to help make sense of what is going on, offering up such observations as, "It's been five long and lingerieless years since my last Victoria's Secret show." Doja Cat guest-stars as the requisite musical artist, as well as the only cast member in classically "sexy" undies.
But the fashion and musical segments are interspersed with short documentaries about projects from the VS 20, yet another group of women: five from each featured city, including one designer (who made the clothes in the fashion shows from the Barcelona set), one filmmaker (who made each city's documentary) and three other "creatives," like painters or poets or musicians, all of whom were handed a blank check by Victoria's Secret to do whatever they wanted.
Which, it turns out, often had little to do with Victoria's Secret in particular and more with what it means to be a woman and the meaning of the body in all its imperfect glory. And, like the clothes in the fashion shows, which range from gossamer silver knits by the London designer Supriya Lele to explosive raffia-fringed pieces sourced from across Africa by Bubu Ogisi, a designer in Lagos, the projects are not being mass produced. The art won't be used by Victoria's Secret for any purpose beyond the film. In other words, it won't be commercialized, thus underscoring the company's altruistic desire to give the women as big a platform as possible while receiving nothing in return.
Except, of course, Victoria's Secret is receiving something from its relationships with its artists: the various stamps of approval from individuals who may otherwise never have given much thought to a lingerie brand known for making women into popsies.
(The only clothes that will eventually appear in stores will be versions of the fifth collection featured in the "Tour" and made by Victoria's Secret itself. Heavy on the bustiers and corsetry, with the occasional leather bra top and gold crystal hot pants, it is still free of the ridiculous accessorizing -- balloons! elf boots! dumbbells! -- that used to characterize the show.)
When asked in interviews before the film's unveiling if they were surprised when Victoria's Secret reached out to them, some of the featured women laughed and said yes. Ari Wegner, the cinematographer who shot the Barcelona segment and whose most recent pre-Victoria's Secret gig was the Jane Campion movie "The Power of the Dog," said that the brand was just not one "that spoke to me at all growing up." Ms. Ogisi, the Nigerian designer, said she was so skeptical when she got the first emails that she didn't even respond until she started getting messages from friends saying Victoria's Secret was trying to reach her.
The implication of these women's involvement being: If they believe Victoria's Secret has changed, and they all said they did, it must really have changed.
The Verdict
The problem is, in elevating so many different voices, in trying so earnestly to be all things to all these different women -- all of whom were present on Wednesday at the unveiling, cheering one another on as the segments appeared on film -- the "Tour" ends up being nothing in particular.
It's not enough, in the end, for a brand to simply say it stands for "women." It has to offer up a coherent point of view on women and what it thinks women need. Especially if what it makes is underwear, that most intimate of garments. Especially if it has the sort of baggage Victoria's Secret is toting. (Besides, the entirety of women's fashion should, at least in theory, stand for "women.")
That may be why the most intriguing parts of the film come courtesy of Jenny Fax, the designer for the Tokyo segment, and the London artist Michaela Stark, a creator of corsetry that forces confrontation with body parts most of us are conditioned to hide. Both of them directly confront the history of Victoria's Secret and then make it into something new.
Ms. Fax, for example, created a cast of her own middle-aged form, with all its fleshy rolls, and from there molded shift dresses in her image out of thermoplastic polyurethane for her models to wear. She mixed in pastiches of old Victoria's Secret lingerie: giant lacy bras and chiffon nighties collaged together into colorful versions of an otherwise banal housedress. Ms. Stark delved into the actual Victoria's Secret archives and had a play session with the wings and other infantilizing accessories of the past, only to reclaim them and recontextualize them as part of her own art: She put them on bodies the former Victoria's Secret would never have let in the door.
Together their work tells a story about confronting these old mores and prejudices, the ones the company was originally complicit in creating, in the most ironically positive way. In their hands, underwear becomes a statement of liberation. That's an identity Victoria's Secret could work with.
Indeed, to coincide with the preview party, Victoria's Secret posted a new campaign on Instagram featuring many of the models in the movie living life on the streets of New York -- walking around, getting their nails done, standing outside the dry cleaner -- while wearing vintage wings. It's awfully fun to watch.

The American Renaissance Is Already at Hand: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two megatrends have shaped American life since the 1980s: The rise of China and the hollowing out of American industry.
China's economic boom prompted a thousand predictions -- that it will soon surpass us as an economic power, that the 21st century is going to be a Chinese century, that America is an aging, decadent nation destined for second place.
The hollowing out of American industry fed the sense that capitalism is betraying the middle class. America has a parasitic financial sector, but we don't make things anymore. Manufacturing jobs got outsourced to China and Mexico, and wages stagnated.
These two trends contributed to the sense that America is in decline -- to the angry, gloomy pall that has settled over political life.
But it's beginning to look as if those two megatrends are reversing.
China does not look like a growing dynamic power, but a troubled, stagnating one. Growth rates are falling. The unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 24 in urban areas is at a demoralizing 21 percent. Private investment is sluggish. A forecast from Bloomberg Economics now projects that the size of the Chinese economy will not successfully surpass the size of the American economy -- despite its vastly greater population.
The causes of China's stagnation are myriad and deep: An overinvestment in real estate, the decline in foreign investment as the state become more menacing, the decline of exports, the demographic doom spiral. Since 2016, the actual number of births in China has fallen by nearly 50 percent.
But the core problems are endemic to the regime: Centralized authoritarian control is incompatible with a wide-open, innovative, free-flowing modern economy. Industrial policy may look good for a short time, but it ossifies. China now has a plethora of zombie corporations, which suck up subsidies without successfully competing in the marketplace. Open information flow is crucial to any nation; when the state suppresses information unflattering to the regime, then everything is bound to sink into mediocrity.
As the Chinese economy deflates, American industry is looking less hollow. America has a net gain of 530,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017. The manufacturing boom has been torrid of late. Since late 2021, investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities has more than doubled.
Much of that boom is happening in the mountain West, the Upper Midwest and parts of the Southeast. Chips, electric vehicles, renewable energy sources and batteries are being manufactured in places like Michigan, Kentucky, Minnesota and Arizona.
Over the last few years, for example, scads of tech firms have decided to invest in manufacturing plants in formerly rust belt Ohio: Intel ( $ 20 billion), Amazon ( $ 7.8 billion), Google ( $ 3.7 billion). According to a Hoover Institution study, Ohio in 2020 attracted almost 14 times more new capital projects per capita than California.
In short, capital, construction and manufacturing are flowing back into many places that have taken their hits. Since 2011, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wage growth has "accelerated more for high school graduates than for college graduates."
What lessons are we to draw from these two ongoing turnarounds? The first is that there's a lot of resilience and dynamism in America's brand of broadly free market capitalism. As I've noted before, in 1990 the European and American gross domestic products per capita were nearly neck and neck. Since then, America has surged ahead. American labor productivity increased by 67 percent between 1990 and 2022, compared to 55 percent in Europe and 51 percent in Japan.
In 2012 I heard a commencement speech by Dr. Atul Gawande that introduced me to the phrase "failure to rescue." He reported on a study that found the best hospitals don't necessarily prevent bad things from happening, but they're really good at rescuing people when they have a complication to prevent failures from becoming catastrophes.
The American economy, especially in the Midwest, is kind of like that. Many of those places have experienced economic decline, but governments and people have shifted and adapted, and they are bouncing back.
The second lesson I draw is that Bidenomics is working -- big time. President Biden promised to help America outcompete authoritarian China and to heal some of the economic divides at home. Both those goals are being achieved.
According to the Treasury Department, over 80 percent of the investment made through the Inflation Reduction Act is going to counties with college graduation rates lower than the national average. Nearly 90 percent of investments are being made in counties with below-average weekly wages.
I know many of you think Biden is too old, but I'd vote for a 100-year-old who could keep delivering results like that.
The third lesson I draw is that the right-wing populists are hopelessly outdated. Take, for example, the writer Sohrab Ahmari, who argues that "the state must also take a far more active role in coordinating economic activity for the good of the whole community." But China's industrial policy illustrates the classic downsides of excessive state interference. Even the vaunted German model, one of the great success stories of the 20th century, is showing its age. German manufacturing output and gross domestic product have been stagnant since 2018.
American politics is dysfunctional, our social fabric is in tatters, but somehow our economy is among the strongest in the world. Our economic competitors stumble and fall; we stumble, and somehow bounce back.

Full text: The deal for Creative Artists Agency by François-Henri Pinault's family office reflects the growing convergence of celebrities and fashion.
In a deal that shows the ever-growing convergence of fashion and fame, François-Henri Pinault, the French billionaire and chief executive of the luxury goods company Kering, said on Thursday that his family office had bought a majority stake in one of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency.
Mr. Pinault's family office, Artémis, already has investments that include the auction house Christie's and a stake in Puma. Like them, CAA will be managed separately from Kering, which owns such brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.
Talent -- actors, singers, filmmakers -- has become a uniquely powerful tool in selling products. Celebrities, be they actors, athletes or social media stars, give a brand direct access to legions of followers and are handsomely paid for that access. Fashion brands are increasingly racing to lock in relationships with the next big name.
"There's no separation between fashion and entertainment anymore," said Robert Burke, the eponymous founder of a luxury consultancy, calling the deal a "natural, if unprecedented, evolution."
CAA's clients include some of the biggest celebrities: Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Zendaya -- as well as Mr. Pinault's wife, the actress Salma Hayek Pinault, who is often next to her husband in the front row of fashion shows, and who often wears Gucci and Balenciaga gowns on the red carpet.
The deal offers Artémis "increased diversity, both in terms of geographical footprint and business activities, to our other assets," Mr. Pinault said in a statement. "CAA's exceptional insight, relationships and access across key sectors, combined with their widely regarded level of collaboration and innovation, gives the company a formidable role in driving global opportunities."
CAA has been led by the powerhouse team of Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane and Richard Lovett, and they will remain as chairmen, according to a news release about the deal. Mr. Lourd will be named chief executive when the deal closes.
Along with the appointment of the music producer Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton men's wear, the CAA acquisition reflects just how important access to celebrity has become to the fashion world -- and how important fashion is to celebrities. Especially during the actors' strike, as commercial work with brands remains one of the few avenues of income and profile-raising that the union, SAG-AFTRA, approves.
In 2010, the private equity firm TPG took a 35 percent stake in CAA, then broadened its hold on the talent agency to 53 percent four years later. Artémis is acquiring that majority stake, according to the news release, though it did not specify the price.
The agency's rivals, meanwhile, have raced to scale up to strengthen their negotiating power with streaming powerhouses like Amazon, Netflix and Apple.
United Talent Agency, which represents celebrities like Chris Pratt, Bad Bunny and Lizzo, bought the literary agency Fletcher & Company in January after acquiring the London-based Curtis Brown agency last year. The Endeavor Group, a CAA rival, acquired full control of the wrestling business Ultimate Fighting Championship in 2021 ahead of Endeavor's initial public offering. This year, Endeavor struck a deal to merge UFC with World Wide Wrestling as part of a new company.
As these talent agencies grow -- and further intertwine themselves with fashion -- new questions may emerge about the nature of these relationships. Even if the new CAA is separate from Kering, for example, would LVMH, the world's dominant luxury group, want to pay millions to celebrities to represent its brands when it knows that a percentage of that payment will enrich a company with a relationship to its competitor?
After all, "even if it's managed separately, this offers enormous access to talent," Mr. Burke said.
The CAA acquisition is the latest in a series of moves from Mr. Pinault. This year, Kering bought a 30 percent stake in Valentino, the Roman fashion brand and red carpet staple, with an option to acquire the whole thing by 2028. That deal followed the Kering purchase of Creed, the high-end fragrance brand, for $ 3.83 billion.
And Kering itself has also ventured into film. Saint Laurent became the first luxury fashion brand with a movie subsidiary when it introduced Saint Laurent Productions in April; its debut short, directed by Pedro Almodóvar, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. (Kering became an official partner of the film festival in 2015.)
As to whether other luxury moguls might follow Mr. Pinault's lead and look to acquire their own talent agency, Mr. Burke added, "I'm never surprised by anyone in fashion following someone else's smart idea."

Remote Class Exacerbated Inequalities, Report Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Heavy reliance on online remote learning during the pandemic drew attention away from more equitable ways of teaching children at home, a UNESCO report says.
In early 2020, as the coronavirus spread, schools around the world abruptly halted in-person education. To many governments and parents, moving classes online seemed the obvious stopgap solution.
In the United States, school districts scrambled to secure digital devices for students. Almost overnight, videoconferencing software like Zoom became the main platform teachers used to deliver real-time instruction to students at home.
Now a report from UNESCO, the United Nations' educational and cultural organization, says that overreliance on remote learning technology during the pandemic led to "staggering" education inequality around the world. It was, according to a 655-page report that UNESCO released on Wednesday, a worldwide "ed-tech tragedy."
The report, from UNESCO's Future of Education division, is likely to add fuel to the debate over how governments and local school districts handled pandemic restrictions, and whether it would have been better for some countries to reopen schools for in-person instruction sooner.
The UNESCO researchers argued in the report that "unprecedented" dependence on technology -- intended to ensure that children could continue their schooling -- worsened disparities and learning loss for hundreds of millions of students around the world, including in Kenya, Brazil, Britain and the United States.
The promotion of remote online learning as the primary solution for pandemic schooling also hindered public discussion of more equitable, lower-tech alternatives, such as regularly providing schoolwork packets for every student, delivering school lessons by radio or television -- and reopening schools sooner for in-person classes, the researchers said.
"Available evidence strongly indicates that the bright spots of the ed-tech experiences during the pandemic, while important and deserving of attention, were vastly eclipsed by failure," the UNESCO report said.
The UNESCO researchers recommended that education officials prioritize in-person instruction with teachers, not online platforms, as the primary driver of student learning. And they encouraged schools to ensure that emerging technologies like A.I. chatbots concretely benefitted students before introducing them for educational use.
Education and industry experts welcomed the report, saying more research on the effects of pandemic learning was needed.
"The report's conclusion -- that societies must be vigilant about the ways digital tools are reshaping education -- is incredibly important," said Paul Lekas, the head of global public policy for the Software & Information Industry Association, a group whose members include Amazon, Apple and Google. "There are lots of lessons that can be learned from how digital education occurred during the pandemic and ways in which to lessen the digital divide."
Jean-Claude Brizard, the chief executive of Digital Promise, a nonprofit education group that has received funding from Google, HP and Verizon, acknowledged that "technology is not a cure-all." But he also said that while school systems were largely unprepared for the pandemic, online education tools helped foster "more individualized, enhanced learning experiences as schools shifted to virtual classrooms."
Education International, an umbrella organization for about 380 teachers' unions and 32 million teachers worldwide, said the UNESCO report underlined the importance of in-person, face-to-face teaching.
"The report tells us definitively what we already know to be true, a place called school matters," said Haldis Holst, the group's deputy general secretary. "Education is not transactional nor is it simply content delivery. It is relational. It is social. It is human at its core."
Here are some of the main findings in the report:
The promise of education technology was overstated.
For more than a decade, Silicon Valley tech giants as well as industry-financed nonprofit groups and think tanks have promoted computers, apps and internet access in public schools as innovations that would quickly democratize and modernize student learning.
Many promised that such digital tools would allow schoolchildren to more easily pursue their interests, learn at their own pace and receive instant automated feedback on their work from learning analytics algorithms.
The report's findings challenge the view that digital technologies are synonymous with educational equality and progress.
The report said that when coronavirus cases began spiking in early 2020, the overselling of ed-tech tools helped make remote online learning seem like the most appealing and effective solution for pandemic schooling even as more equitable, lower-tech options were available.
Remote online learning worsened education disparities.
UNESCO researchers found the shift to remote online learning tended to provide substantial advantages to children in wealthier households while disadvantaging those in lower-income families.
By May 2020, the report said, 60 percent of national remote learning programs "relied exclusively" on internet-connected platforms. But nearly half a billion young people -- about half the primary and secondary students worldwide -- targeted by those remote learning programs lacked internet connections at home, the report said, excluding them from participating.
According to data and surveys cited in the report, one-third of kindergarten through 12th-grade students in the United States "were cut off from education" in 2020 because of inadequate internet connections or hardware. In 2021 in Pakistan, 30 percent of households said they were aware of remote learning programs while fewer than half of this group had the technology needed to participate.
Learning was hindered and altered.
Student learning outcomes stalled or "declined dramatically" when schools deployed ed tech as a replacement for in-person instruction, the UNESCO researchers said, even when children had access to digital devices and internet connections.
The report also said students learning online spent considerably less time on formal educational tasks -- and more time on monotonous digital tasks. It described a daily learning routine "less of discovery and exploration than traversing file-sharing systems, moving through automated learning content, checking for updates on corporate platforms and enduring long video calls."
Remote online learning also limited or curtailed student opportunities for socialization and nonacademic activities, the report said, causing many students to become disengaged or drop out of school.
The report warned that the shift to remote learning also gave a handful of tech platforms -- like Google and Zoom -- extraordinary influence in schools. These digital systems often imposed private business values and agendas, the report added, that were at odds with the "humanistic" values of public schooling.
Regulation and guardrails are needed.
To prevent a repeat scenario, the researchers recommended that schools prioritize the best interests of schoolchildren as the central criteria for deploying ed tech.
In practical terms, the researchers called for more regulation and guardrails around online learning tools. They also suggested that districts give teachers more say over which digital tools schools adopt and how they are used.

A Behemoth Turns to Its Ace In Its Biggest Antitrust Fight Yet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant is facing the greatest legal threat in its history, and hopes the stolid approach of Kent Walker, its top lawyer, will once again prevail.
When the government started an antitrust investigation into Google, one of the company's top lawyers, Kent Walker, said the solution was not a charm offensive. Google just needed to explain how its business functioned.
It was 2009, and the Federal Trade Commission was assessing whether Google had rigged technology markets in its favor. Mr. Walker's plan worked. The company agreed to a few small business practice changes in a 2013 settlement and maintained its search engine dominance for another decade.
Now, Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are facing their most significant legal challenge. They are preparing to face off next week in federal court against the Justice Department and a collection of states, which claim the tech giant illegally abused its monopoly power to keep its search engine on top.
The Justice Department has argued that Google illegally used agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung, as well as internet browsers like Mozilla, to be the default search engine for their users, preventing smaller rivals from getting access to that business.
The court fight -- the most important antitrust case since the Justice Department took on Microsoft 25 years ago -- strikes at the heart of Alphabet's $ 1.7 trillion empire and could strip power and influence away from the world's most successful internet company.
If Google loses and a judge then approves remedies, it could eventually be forced to restructure in some way, and it could be subject to damages and a prohibition on search distribution deals. That would translate to fewer users, deflated profits and perhaps even limits on how Google is able to innovate with new technologies like artificial intelligence.
To fend off the regulators' claims, Google needs to convince Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that Google's decades of dominance are due to its superior product, not abusive tactics.
The company is counting on Mr. Walker, 62, once again. Since being hired as Google's general counsel in 2006, Mr. Walker has been an architect of the company's legal strategy, overseeing a victory in a protracted courtroom showdown with rival Oracle and a case that could have held Google liable for users' social media posts. Both legal fights went to the Supreme Court.
That Mr. Walker is defending an industry giant against the monopoly claims of regulators is an odd turnabout in his long career. He grew up in Palo Alto, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley, and graduated from Harvard and Stanford Law School. Starting in 1990, he spent five formative years at the Justice Department, where he worked on the prosecution of Kevin Mitnick, once the most wanted hacker in the country.
In 1997, Mr. Walker began a pivotal four-year tenure at the pioneering internet company Netscape as deputy general counsel, bringing him into the landmark antitrust proceedings against Microsoft. The Windows company was accused of bundling its products together to snuff out other web browsers, including Netscape's Navigator.
In a recent interview, Mr. Walker argued that he is still fighting for the same thing -- that consumers should have easy access to the services they like the most. He discussed the case in societal terms, framing it as a battle over how much innovation is permissible under American antitrust law and a fight that will have "important implications for the tech sector."
Mr. Walker has dozens of in-house lawyers and hundreds of other employees helping on the antitrust case, he said. Google has also hired three law firms to take the lead on the litigation.
John E. Schmidtlein, an experienced antitrust lawyer and a partner at the law firm Williams & Connolly, will lead Google's courtroom defense. Wendy W.H. Waszmer, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, will also argue for Google in court. They will have three weeks to make their case after the Justice Department and attorneys general from 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam make theirs.
The company contends that it faces stiff competition from a number of alternative services where consumers can find products and information online, including Amazon and TikTok.
Google also argues that its partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung are lawful and that consumers can change their default search engine in five or fewer steps on these phones. The company will also point out that when users open a Safari browser on an iPhone, they can see quick links to a variety of other services besides Google, including Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia.
The search giant will also seek to undermine the premise of the Justice Department's suit, claiming that the government has used antitrust law in a novel way to punish the company because of its popularity.
"American law should be about promoting benefits for consumers: that's lower price, that's more innovation, that's more opportunity," Mr. Walker said. "If we move away from that and make it harder for companies to provide great goods and services for consumers, that's going to be bad for everyone."
Gregory Rosston, Stanford's public policy program director, said both sides would argue about whether the search market would be more competitive if Google did not have default-search agreements.
"Google is going to argue Apple had no interest in developing a search engine," Dr. Rosston said. "They do search in Siri and other things, but they're not very good at it. The government is going to say, well, they could have done it or they could have done a deal with Bing or some other start-up search engine, and maybe people would have done more searches with those."
"Generally, antitrust laws take a dim view of agreements between competitors to divide up or not enter a market," he added.
For nearly two decades, Google executives have depended on Mr. Walker to protect the company from high-stakes litigation. But at times, Mr. Walker has also had to simply explain how the legal system works. Harry Litman, a friend and former Justice Department colleague of Mr. Walker, recounted a story he shared at a reunion for U.S. attorneys several years ago.
Mr. Walker was in a meeting with Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, discussing a spate of lawsuits around the world, Mr. Litman said. One of the co-founders asked: Why can't we have a single judge in every country who would get up to speed on the internet and oversee lawsuits against us?
Mr. Walker "was chuckling about his job, having to explain to these extremely rational people why the law doesn't always work in such a rational way," Mr. Litman said.
Despite what colleagues and friends describe as Mr. Walker's Boy Scout persona, his team can be known for hardball tactics, legal opponents say. David Boies, who successfully prosecuted Microsoft for the Justice Department more than 20 years ago, said Google failed to produce documents, denied all liability and fought for every inch.
Mr. Boies is suing Google in two civil cases, including one that accuses the company of tracking users without their knowledge while in its web browser's Incognito mode. He said he had gotten sanctions against Google twice, including a million-dollar penalty, for failing to deliver relevant evidence.
"They hold the ground until it breaks," he said. "They don't bend."

The G20 Keeps Failing. Even So, It Still Matters.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Summits like the one in India this weekend have produced many ambitious statements -- and, often, disappointing results. Critics say an upgrade is needed.
The annual Group of 20 summit brings together world leaders in pursuit of a lofty goal: coordinating policy for the global economy.
But how much progress has the G20 made toward its ambitions? And what can be expected from this year's meeting in India on Saturday and Sunday?
The agenda in New Delhi includes climate change, economic development and debt burdens in low-income countries, as well as inflation spurred by Russia's war in Ukraine. If members can reach consensus on any or all of these subjects, they will produce an official joint declaration at the end.
Then what? Often, not much, when it comes to real-world results. Most of the grouping's joint statements since it formed in 1999 have been dominated by resolutions as solid as gas fumes, with no clear consequences when nations underperform.
One example: At the 2021 summit in Rome, G20 leaders said they would limit global warming with "meaningful and effective actions," highlighting a pledge to end the financing of coal power plants overseas.
But the communiqué left out domestic coal investments. And in 2022, coal-fired power generation worldwide reached a new high, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, investment in coal is expected to rise by another 10 percent, to $ 150 billion -- despite G20 statements and a scientific consensus that coal use must end immediately.
What has the G20 accomplished?
The G20 began with a meeting of finance ministers after the wave of steep currency devaluations in the late 1990s, and added an annual meeting of world leaders after the global financial crisis a decade later.
Senior officials (mostly Germans, Canadians and Americans) pushed for what they saw as a more flexible, inclusive forum than the Western-led Group of 7 nations, or G7. They believed that convening both established and rising powers would better protect the global economy, and early evidence suggested that they were right.
Many experts praised the group for stabilizing the financial system in 2008 and 2009 by agreeing to spending measures worth $ 4 trillion and instituting bank reforms to rebuild trust.
The 2016 summit in China also showed the power of bringing leaders together when President Barack Obama and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, announced that their countries would sign on to the Paris Agreement on climate.
More recently, in 2021, the G20 supported a major tax overhaul that included a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent for each country. It also backed new rules that would require large global businesses like Amazon to pay taxes in countries where their products are sold, even if they lack offices there.
The plan promised to add billions in government revenue and make tax havens less of a driving force for corporations. But, as with a lot of G20 statements, follow-through has been weak.
"The global tax agreement is an important step in the right direction," the International Monetary Fund declared this year, "but it is not yet operational."
Why has the G20 struggled to make an impact?
Some critics argue that the G20 was flawed from the start, with a membership roster based on the whims of Western finance officials and central bankers.
According to Robert Wade, a political economy professor at the London School of Economics, German and American officials "went down the list of countries saying, Canada in, Portugal out, South Africa in, Nigeria and Egypt out, and so on."
For example, Argentina is neither an emerging economy nor among the 20 largest. It is a G20 member, many argue, because one of its former economy ministers, Domingo Cavallo, was a Harvard roommate of Larry Summers, the U.S. Treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001.
In an email, Professor Wade said the organization still suffered from a "lack of representational procedures," without a well-defined process for inclusion.
"A given state is in or out, permanently," he said.
The group's summits have also become a forum for the forces pulling against the established post-World War II order. When the G20 started, there was more consensus about how to hold the world together. Free trade was ascendant; great power rivalry seemed but a memory; and optimists worldwide hoped that the G20 would lead to a broader power base for aging institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.
Those hopes are still there, and blossoming elsewhere (the recent BRICS summit in South Africa is the latest example). But conflicts have supplanted G20 team efforts. The United States and China have become bitter competitors. Nationalism has surged as networked economies have come to look far riskier after the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up food and energy prices for countries far from the front lines.
"There's a lot more dissatisfaction with hyper-globalization, open trade and free capital," said Stewart Patrick, director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "In a situation where the global economy is fracturing and countries are pursuing their own thing, the question is, what do you do when you still have rules and institutions that were created for a very different environment?"
Does the world need the G20?
Few critics want to see the G20 eliminated. They worry that it is already weakening, with Mr. Xi skipping this year's meeting. (President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will also be a no-show.)
Many foreign policy experts argue that the G20's failures simply point to the need for modernization in international institutions.
As Dani Rodrik and Stephen M. Walt wrote last year in Foreign Affairs: "It is increasingly clear that the existing, Western-oriented approach is no longer adequate to address the many forces governing international power relations." They predicted a future with less agreement, in which "Western policy preferences will prevail less" and "each country will have to be granted greater leeway in managing its economy, society and political system."
Professor Wade has called for a reformulated G20, with a core of economic powerhouses complemented by a rotating set of smaller nations. Mr. Patrick said the G20 could play a leading role in the "post-neoliberal" order by discussing how to separate the benefits of trade from the risks of overindulging the free-market system that the organization was built to protect.
"The G20 would be a natural place to begin hammering out what rules of peaceful coexistence permit countries to share in a more tempered globalization," he said. "That would be a positive agenda."

Full text: Movies are full of glamorous hit men. For "The Killer," the director put his star in a bucket hat: "The $ 3,000 suit seems like it's played out."
It's been 24 years since David Fincher brought one of his movies to the Venice Film Festival, and the last time, things didn't go so well.
"I came here with a little film called 'Fight Club"' in 1999, he told me during an interview on the Lido this week. "We were fairly run out of town for being fascists." Even before the premiere of that controversial Brad Pitt flick, the director could sense trouble. "I looked down and the youngest person in our row was Giorgio Armani," Fincher said. "I was like, 'I'm not sure the guest list is the right guest list for this."'
So what makes lofty Venice the right place to premiere "The Killer," Fincher's new thriller and his first film since the Oscar-winning Hollywood drama "Mank"?
"Nothing," cracked Fincher. "Venice seems like it's very highbrow -- important movies about important subjects -- and then there's our skeevy little movie."
Still, Fincher has always enjoyed toying with people's expectations. He does it even within the world of "The Killer," which premiered in Venice on Sunday and stars Fassbender as a hired gun who has to improvise after a fatal assignment goes awry.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Based on a French graphic novel and adapted by Andrew Kevin Walker ("Seven"), the film at first feels like a high-end take on the usual genre tropes: There's the assassin with no name, the innocent woman in the way and the methodical list of revenge targets to be pursued. But then our protagonist's constant patter of narration starts to show cracks, as the Killer often thinks one thing and does another. By the end, you'll wonder if we know this guy at all, or whether he's ever really known himself.
And then there's what he's wearing. Though Hollywood would have us believe that assassins always look impossibly chic and well-tailored, Fincher puts his protagonist in Skechers, a zip-up fleece and a bucket hat.
"He's totally dorky!" the director said. "We were never intending for it to look glamorous."
Inspiration struck when Fincher flipped through reference photos and landed on a German tourist snapped wearing those nondescript items on the streets of Paris. "I was like, 'All of this stuff could be purchased in an airport,"' said Fincher, who sent the photo to his costume designer, Cate Adams. "I said, 'This is what he needs to be, a guy who can get off a plane and buy a whole wardrobe on his way from the gate to the rental car."'
Fincher found no complaints from his leading man, who wasn't in Venice because of the SAG-AFTRA strike: "Michael's cool. He was not freaked out about having to look a little dorky." And that aesthetic extends even to the Killer's escape from a botched job, which takes place not via high-speed car chase but with a zippy little motor scooter, though Fincher considered taking that sequence in an even dweebier direction. "At one point, we even debated the Razor scooter," he said, nixing that only because it wouldn't perform well during a stair stunt.
So though the Killer remains a mystery to himself, at least one thing can be said for sure of this indifferently dressed man: He ain't exactly John Wick.
"The $ 3,000 suit seems like it's played out," Fincher said. Still, he was surprised to find someone wearing his protagonist's silly headwear in another recent assassin movie: "It's funny because when Pitt told me he had selected a bucket hat for 'Bullet Train,' I was like, 'OK, dude, you're stepping into our sandbox."'
Though Fincher has a skill for image-making that extends back to the music videos he directed for the likes of Madonna, with "The Killer," he was more interested in dismantling that sort of cinematic iconography. Instead of a glamorous lair, Fassbender's character keeps his weapons in a mundane storage locker, and instead of using high-tech gadgets to break into targets' homes, he orders key-duplication tools off Amazon.
"I was like, 'I want James Bond by way of Home Depot,"' Fincher said. "By the end of this, you should be like, who's the guy in the rental car line with you, and why is he wearing that outdated hat? You ignore the German tourist at your peril."
And while the movies would have us believe that the world is full of clever, high-flying assassins, Fincher sought to ground his character's tunnel vision in a more mundane reality. "I love the idea of a Charles Bronson character who's maybe misdiagnosed adult autistic," he said. "And before 2023, I'm not sure anybody would have gone, 'Oh, that makes sense."'
So if the Killer's fashion choices or inner motivations sometimes stump you, just know that's by design.
"He seems to have a hard time reading the room," Fincher said. "And any room that he goes into, eventually, he's the only guy in it."

Naomi Klein, Naomi Wolf And the Political Upside Down: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I've been raving about Naomi Klein's "Doppelganger" since I read an advance copy this summer, and when I tell people about it, some of them are baffled: You mean Klein wrote a whole book about being confused with the writer Naomi Wolf? The central conceit of "Doppelganger" sounds more like the premise for a surreal Charlie Kaufman film than a work by an earnest lefty who usually writes about overweening corporate power. Klein herself is apologetic about it. "In my defense, it was never my intent to write this book," she says in its first line.
We should all be glad she did, because I can't think of another text that better captures the berserk period we're living through. Only in a superficial sense is "Doppelganger" really about Wolf, the liberal feminist icon turned anti-vax Steve Bannon sidekick. Instead, it's about the instability of identity in the virtual world and the forces pulling people away from constructive politics into a shadow realm where clout chasing and conspiracy theorizing intertwine.
Klein and Wolf, both brown-haired middle-aged Jewish women writers, are often mistaken for each other. That became a growing problem for Klein as her reputation was tainted by Wolf's escalating lunacy. Trapped at home by the pandemic, Klein became increasingly obsessed by Wolf's transformation into a heroine of Covid truthers.
That obsession, in turn, guides Klein into an examination of what she calls "the Mirror World," the vertigo-inducing inversion of reality common to contemporary far-right movements. Think, for example, of Vladimir Putin claiming that he's liberating Ukraine from fascism or Donald Trump howling that his multiple prosecutions are a racist plot to subvert a presidential election. When I spoke to Klein recently, she described how jarring it was to watch protests against Covid measures appropriating left-wing language -- common slogans were "I can't breathe" and "My body, my choice" -- making them "this weird doppelganger of the movements that I had been a part of and supported."
This idea of the doppelganger gave me a new way to think about the mix of malicious parody and projection that now dominates our public life. Sometime soon, for example, the House is likely to impeach President Biden on the pretext that he was involved in corruption in Ukraine -- the same conspiracy theory Trump was trying to breathe life into when he got himself impeached for corruption in Ukraine. This coming doppelganger impeachment is hard to even discuss without getting pulled down innumerable rabbit holes, which is surely part of the point.
"How comforting it would be if Wolf were a fake we could unmask -- and not a symptom of a mass unraveling of meaning afflicting, well, everything," writes Klein. This unraveling, of course, was well underway before Covid, but the pandemic accelerated it by forcing people to live online, communicating on platforms seemingly algorithmically designed to reward rage and paranoia.
Wolf's story is instructive. "The Beauty Myth," her 1990 blockbuster about the toll taken on women by the upward ratchet of unreasonable beauty standards, made her famous. In retrospect, the seeds of her intellectual decline were already present in that book, which contained both major statistical errors and a conspiratorial subtext that painted the influence of patriarchy as a deliberate plot. In the ensuing years, her work grew increasingly sloppy and absurd, until her reputation collapsed altogether in 2019 with the publication of "Outrages."
Wolf faced the singular mortification of being confronted, live on the radio, with evidence that her book's central contention -- that several dozen men in Victorian England were executed for having same-sex relationships -- was based on a misreading of historical records. That October, her U.S. publisher canceled the release of "Outrages."
"If you want an origin story, an event when Wolf's future flip to the pseudopopulist right was locked in, it was probably that moment, live on the BBC, getting caught -- and then getting shamed, getting mocked and getting pulped," writes Klein. Klein had a front-row seat to the pile-on, since much of it was mistakenly directed at her. She writes with real empathy about how, coming only a few months after the death of Wolf's father, this professional implosion meant that Wolf "went into the destabilizing period of the pandemic in an already highly destabilized state."
But in channeling the fears of people similarly unmoored by Covid, Wolf seems to have found something like stability, gaining a new audience that accorded her the respect she'd lost. In "The Shock Doctrine," Klein writes about how rapacious capitalists take advantage of disasters. Wolf peddled a bizarro-world version of that idea, describing the response to the virus as a ploy to impose global totalitarianism. I looked up her most recent book, "The Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, Covid-19 and the War Against the Human," on Amazon. A best seller, it features glowing endorsements from Bannon and Tucker Carlson. (Wolf told The New York Times Magazine that she hasn't read Klein's book.)
In "Doppelganger," Klein offers a half-joking formula to explain onetime leftists or liberals who migrate to the authoritarian right: "Narcissism(Grandiosity) + Social media addiction + Midlife crisis ÷ Public shaming = Right wing meltdown." As Klein emphasizes, Wolf's journey into the Mirror World can't really be described as a fall. She and others like her, says Klein, "are getting everything they had and more, through a warped mirror." For Klein, the more important question is less about Wolf's motivations than those of her followers. Somehow, Wolf's apocalyptic pronouncements about sinister drug companies and imminent technological tyranny speak to these people in a way that the left does not.
"When looking at the Mirror World, it can seem obvious that millions of people have given themselves over to fantasy, to make-believe, to playacting," writes Klein. "The trickier thing, the uncanny thing, really, is that's what they see when they look at us."

Telluride Goes On, With Strike Caveats: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The festival opened this weekend with fewer stars, who were wary of breaking union rules about promoting films while two strikes have shut down much of Hollywood.
Majestic vistas, burbling brooks and sanguine festival goers are the hallmarks of the Telluride Film Festival, a showcase for the most prestigious films of the year. But no amount of natural beauty can overcome the low-level of anxiety that coursed through this mountain town over Labor Day weekend. With dual strikes raging in Hollywood -- the writers' strike just hit four months -- no one wants to appear out of step with these unprecedented times.
"It was hell getting here," Julie Huntsinger, the executive director of the Telluride Film Festival, said in an interview. "There was just so much anxiety and nervousness. Once the actors went on strike, all bets were off. I had to call up every company and say, 'Please, please, please, don't go away."'
But according to Ms. Huntsinger, it went off without a hitch. The festival, long considered one of the preferred stops for films vying for Oscar consideration, both for studio-backed projects and independent films, received every movie it requested, including a handful of world premieres.
Unlike most film festivals, Telluride is more of a viewing than sales opportunity -- though some filmmakers do attend in search of distribution partners. This year's program, one day longer than usual in order to honor its 50th anniversary, was filled, and only two directors didn't show up. Stars, on the other hand, faced a more complicated situation because of the strikes.
Scheduled tributes for Annette Bening and Gael García Bernal were canceled. Prominent actors such as Austin Butler, Paul Mescal, Jodie Foster and Colman Domingo were not here even though their films were premiering. And those who did come were concerned about how their appearance would play to the public.
The SAG-AFTRA union, which has been on strike against the major studios since July 14, has forbidden its membership to promote any project financed by them. Independent films, though, can receive special dispensation from the union, termed an "interim agreement," that allows its members to show up and tout their projects as long as the independent producers have agreed to SAG's latest demands.
Eleven of the 26 narrative films shown were backed by divisions of the big studios, whose actors couldn't attend the festival because of union rules.
Yet, SAG's clarity on that guidance came less than a week before the start of the Colorado event, causing a lot of stress for actors eager to promote their films but anxious about running afoul of their union.
Julia Louis-Dreyfus's film "Tuesday," from the indie studio A24, received an interim agreement only on Monday, for a film premiering on Thursday. "I'm delighted to have gotten it. Obviously, I wouldn't have come otherwise," she said. "But it was a real mad scramble to get here."
Ms. Louis-Dreyfus set a path for how her fellow union members can behave during this season of labor unrest. The actress made a rousing speech on behalf of her union's fight at her film's premiere and has followed it up with interviews that highlight both her work in the film and her stance on the strikes.
Studio executives would not speak on the record for this article because of sensitivities surrounding the strike, but said the screening experience has been bittersweet because actors were not able to share in their films' success.
Emma Stone, the star of "Poor Things," a film from Disney's Searchlight Pictures that premiered at Telluride on Saturday, came to the festival as a spectator and did not promote her film, in accordance with guidance from SAG. Dakota Johnson, who has an interim agreement, also attended to promote and seek distribution for her film "Daddio," which she produced.
And Ethan Hawke trekked to the mountain town with "Wildcat," the independent film he directed about the novelist Flannery O'Connor, along with Laura Linney and his daughter Maya Hawke, two of the film's actors. The three were also covered by an interim agreement.
Ms. Linney, who owns a home in Telluride and is a longtime attendee of the festival, admitted to being wary early on about attending. "I was very nervous before the interim agreement was made clear to us and why it exists and what it really means," she said.
Emerald Fennell, the writer-director behind Amazon's "Saltburn," who is also a member of both SAG and the Writers Guild of America (she played Midge in "Barbie"), introduced her film on Thursday night while wearing a W.G.A. pin. She was allowed to be there because she was attending as a member of the Directors Guild of America, which recently settled on a new contract with the big studios, but her role is complicated because her movie is financed by Amazon, part of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group representing the major studios and streamers.
And on Friday afternoon, Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm, a member of the studio alliance, and her husband, the veteran producer Frank Marshall, held their annual Telluride event at their house in town.
A handmade sign saying "Switzerland" adorned the entryway, and guests seemed to embrace the sentiment with executives from Amazon; National Geographic, a Disney company; and Higher Ground, former President Barack Obama's production company, which has a distribution deal with Netflix, mingling with filmmakers and actors. The vibe was convivial and centered more on the movies than the contentious rhetoric heard on the picket lines.
On Friday night, the filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who are married, debuted their first narrative feature, the Netflix film "Nyad." The film, about Diana Nyad's 35-year quest to swim from Cuba to the Florida Keys, stars Ms. Bening as the swimmer and Ms. Foster as her best friend and coach.
Neither actress could attend the festival because Netflix is represented by the studio alliance and their appearances would be akin to crossing a picket line. Ms. Nyad, who as a sports broadcaster is also a member of SAG, also chose not to attend.
Rather, it was up to Mr. Chin and Ms. Vasarhelyi to carry the promotional load for the film, lauding the acting prowess of both Ms. Bening and Ms. Foster while also extolling the virtues of their studio for taking a flier on a subject matter that does not get a lot of attention in Hollywood, a sports drama that Mr. Chin called a "female, gay buddy comedy."
But squaring their gratitude for Netflix with their support for the writers and actors on strike did not come easily.
"We're just trying to be good citizens," said Ms. Vasarhelyi, who in one breath uttered her utmost "respect for the writers and actors" and then praised "the great executives" at Netflix who protected her film.
"It's a lot to balance."

A.I. Revolution Is Coming. Just When Is Hard to Say.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: From steam power to the internet, there has always been a lag between technology invention and adoption across industries and the economy.
Lori Beer, the global chief information officer of JPMorgan Chase, talks about the latest artificial intelligence with the enthusiasm of a convert. She refers to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT, with its ability to produce everything from poetry to computer programs, as "transformative" and a "paradigm shift."
But it's not coming soon to the nation's largest bank. JPMorgan has blocked access to ChatGPT from its computers and told its 300,000 workers not to put any bank information into the chatbot or other generative A.I. tools.
For now, Ms. Beer said, there are too many risks of leaking confidential data, questions about how the data is used and about the accuracy of the A.I.-generated answers. The bank has created a walled-off, private network to allow a few hundred data scientists and engineers to experiment with the technology. They are exploring uses like automating and improving tech support and software development.
Across corporate America, the perspective is much the same. Generative A.I., the software engine behind ChatGPT, is seen as an exciting new wave of technology. But companies in every industry are mainly trying out the technology and thinking through the economics. Widespread use of it at many companies could be years away.
Generative A.I., according to forecasts, could sharply boost productivity and add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Yet the lesson of history, from steam power to the internet, is that there is a lengthy lag between the arrival of major new technology and its broad adoption -- which is what transforms industries and helps fuel the economy.
Take the internet. In the 1990s, there were confident predictions that the internet and the web would disrupt the retailing, advertising and media industries. Those predictions proved to be true, but that was more than a decade later, well after the dot-com bubble had burst.
Over that time, the technology improved and costs dropped, so bottlenecks fell away. Broadband internet connections eventually became commonplace. Easy-to-use payment systems were developed. Audio and video streaming technology became far better.
Fueling the development were a flood of money and a surge of entrepreneurial trial and error.
"We're going to see a similar gold rush this time," said Vijay Sankaran, chief technology officer of Johnson Controls, a large supplier of building equipment, software and services. "We'll see a lot of learning."
The investment frenzy is well underway. In the first half of 2023, funding for generative A.I. start-ups reached $ 15.3 billion, nearly three times the total for all of last year, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-up investments.
Corporate technology managers are sampling generative A.I. software from a host of suppliers and watching to see how the industry shakes out.
In November, when ChatGPT was made available to the public, it was a "Netscape moment" for generative A.I., said Rob Thomas, IBM's chief commercial officer, referring to Netscape's introduction of the browser in 1994. "That brought the internet alive," Mr. Thomas said. But it was just a beginning, opening a door to new business opportunities that took years to exploit.
In a recent report, the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, included a timeline for the widespread adoption of generative A.I. applications. It assumed steady improvement in currently known technology, but not future breakthroughs. Its forecast for mainstream adoption was neither short nor precise, a range of eight to 27 years.
The broad range is explained by plugging in different assumptions about economic cycles, government regulation, corporate cultures and management decisions.
"We're not modeling the laws of physics here; we're modeling economics and societies, and people and companies," said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute. "What happens is largely the result of human choices."
Technology diffuses across the economy through people, who bring their skills to new industries. A few months ago, Davis Liang left an A.I. group at Meta to join Abridge, a health care start-up that records and summarizes patient visits for physicians. Its generative A.I. software can save doctors from hours of typing up patient notes and billing reports.
Mr. Liang, a 29-year-old computer scientist, has been an author on scientific papers and helped build so-called large language models that animate generative A.I.
His skills are in demand these days. Mr. Liang declined to say, but people with his experience and background at generative A.I. start-ups are typically paid a base salary of more than $ 200,000, and stock grants can potentially take the total compensation far higher.
The main appeal of Abridge, Mr. Liang said, was applying the "superpowerful tool" of A.I. in health care and "improving the working lives of physicians." He was recruited by Zachary Lipton, a former research scientist in Amazon's A.I. group, who is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Lipton joined Abridge early this year as chief scientific officer.
"We're not working on ads or something like that," Mr. Lipton said. "There is a level of fulfillment when you're getting thank-you letters from physicians every day."
Significant new technologies are flywheels for follow-on innovation, spawning start-ups that build applications to make the underlying technology useful and accessible. In its early years, the personal computer was seen as a hobbyist's plaything. But the creation of the spreadsheet program -- the "killer app" of its day -- made the PC an essential tool in business.
Sarah Nagy led a data science team at Citadel, a giant investment firm, in 2020 when she first tinkered with GPT-3. It was more than two years before OpenAI released ChatGPT. But the power of the fundamental technology was apparent in 2020.
Ms. Nagy was particularly impressed by the software's ability to generate computer code from text commands. That, she figured, could help democratize data analysis inside companies, making it broadly accessible to businesspeople instead of an elite group.
In 2021, Ms. Nagy founded Seek AI to pursue that goal. The New York start-up now has about two dozen customers in the technology, retail and finance industries, mostly working on pilot projects.
Using Seek AI's software, a retail manager, for example, could type in questions about product sales, ad campaigns and online versus in-store performance to guide marketing strategy and spending. The software then transforms the words into a computer-coded query, searches the company's storehouse of data, and returns answers in text or retrieves the relevant data.
Businesspeople, Ms. Nagy said, can get answers almost instantly or within a day instead of a couple of weeks, if they have to make a request for something that requires the attention of a member of a data science team.
"At the end of the day, we're trying to reduce the time it takes to get an answer or useful data," Ms. Nagy said.
Saving time and streamlining work inside companies are the prime early targets for generative A.I. in most businesses. New products and services will come later.
This year, JPMorgan trademarked IndexGPT as a possible name for a generative A.I.-driven investment advisory product.
"That's something we will look at and continue to assess over time," said Ms. Beer, the bank's tech leader. "But it's not close to launching yet."

Full text: This article is part of our Design special section about new interpretations of antique design styles.
Six years ago, Sonya Schneider and her husband, Stuart Nagae, bought a federally designated historical landmark in Seattle, a 5,000-square-foot, two-story home sheathed in dark, old-growth Western cedar shingles, with multiple gables, dormer windows and a cedar-shake roof. It sat on an unusually large three-quarter-acre lot with mature maples, Douglas fir and a hemlock tree, in Ballard, an old Seattle neighborhood on Puget Sound.
The house, for which the couple paid $ 2.5 million, according to public records, was built in 1933 by a Norwegian ship captain, Ole E. Nilsen, reportedly as a replica of his childhood home in Bergen, Norway.
In the early 20th century, Ballard's shipbuilding, timber and fishing industries attracted thousands of immigrants from Scandinavia, and today the community retains its strong ethnic identity, with an annual Norwegian heritage parade and a new National Nordic Museum.
The house is a unique example of Scandinavian vernacular architecture, inside and out. It was built by highly skilled craftsmen who meticulously paneled the walls and ceilings with Douglas fir. (The boards are placed parallel for the wainscoting and vertically above it.) The living room has a double-height vaulted ceiling with a balcony loft characteristic of 19th-century Norwegian houses; its railing has carved balusters and its support beam is decorated with colorful scrolls, acanthus leaves and floral motifs, a style of traditional rural Norwegian folk painting called rosemaling, or rose painting.
When she first saw the house, Ms. Schneider, 45, a playwright originally from San Diego, recalled that she immediately recognized its value. "I grew up in a house built in 1933 with similar qualities," she said. "I was raised to understand quality of space and fine craftsmanship." (Mr. Nagae, 46, is a Japanese American venture capitalist from Seattle.)
Over the past few years, with a family that includes two daughters, 14 and 11, the couple integrated into the interior their growing collection of contemporary art (by the photographer Nan Goldin, the Indigenous Oregon artist Marie Watt and the Seattle native Roger Shimomura, among others) and an eclectic mix of midcentury and contemporary furniture.
The result is a fresh mix of time-transcendent design elements. "We have the two worlds talking to each other," Ms. Schneider said. "The old house is happy to be covered in contemporary art. We introduced light and color to the dark rooms."
There was only one problem: The galley kitchen was too small. "I think Captain Nilsen had a servant who cooked," Ms. Schneider said. "There is a tiny bedroom in the basement."
The couple decided the house deserved a bigger kitchen, though they didn't pursue any architects until they met one in Rome, six years ago, at a Pearl Jam concert of all places.
Mike Mora, the co-founder of Heliotrope Architects in Seattle, and his wife, Jessica, had come to attend the concert and see their longtime friends Jeff Ament, a member of the Seattle band, and his wife, Pandora Andre-Beatty.
"That night, Pandora introduced me to Sonya and Stuart, and we learned we lived a half-mile away from each other in Seattle," Mr. Mora recalled. "I was really familiar with the house as I pass it every day on my way to work."
Ms. Schneider invited Mr. Mora over and shared her dreams.
She wanted a new, light-filled kitchen where her family and friends could gather, which afforded movement between the interior and garden spaces.
She was completely open minded: "When we began talking, I said, 'Let's go for the wildest scheme and then scale it back; we are drawn to modern architecture."'
Mr. Mora was thrilled. "We were happy we didn't need to design a replica of a 100-year-old building; we could be influenced by it but make an addition very much of its own time, with contemporary lines and more expansive glass."
Heliotrope Architects, founded in 1999, has several high-profile institutional clients, including REI, Amazon, Microsoft and Nordstrom. In 2020, it won the James Beard award for outstanding restaurant design. Its residential work, however, tends to be minimalist, sustainable and with a quality, they say, that "weathers."
Mr. Mora's plan for the kitchen followed those principles; it is deceptively simple-looking, quiet and elegant.
The 500-square-foot addition is a contemporary post-and-beam construction.
"It's one story, because we didn't need any more program," Mr. Mora said. It complements the house but stands on its own.
The two structures are joined by a glass passageway that accentuates the distinct character of each. Mr. Mora chose black brick walls to nod to the dark gray shingles of the house. His plans easily won approval from the local landmarks board. As Ms. Schneider said, "They wanted us to do something that reflected the current period."
The kitchen interior is equally refined: Like the house, it is fully paneled, but in a fresh, contemporary way. The cabinetry is stained white oak; the beams and columns are stained Douglas fir. The ceiling is clear cedar. The floor is polished concrete.
In the cooking area, a long counter with a farm sink sits beneath a glass wall. Behind it is a large, quartzite-topped island, which incorporates the stove and another counter, with bar seating, for eating -- and admiring the cook.
The space is all about clean surfaces; there is no clutter. The cabinetry has no external hardware.
To one side, glass doors open to the west (and a terrace with a view of Puget Sound).
On the wall opposite, built-in cabinetry leads to a kitchen table and four chairs made by the Brooklyn-based designer Bowen Liu and a showstopping Lindsey Adelman blown-glass chandelier. Its glass wall affords a view of the new garden to the south by David Berleth Landscape Architect.
The outdoor terrace to the south, which is shaded by an overhang, has a built-in wood-burning barbecue for grilling, a favorite pastime of Mr. Nagae, but the main action outside is the backyard to the west, with a loggia for private outdoor dining.
The Norwegians have an expression: "Wood is our living archive." As early as A.D. 800, the Vikings displayed their excellent craftsmanship and knowledge of wood construction techniques in their longships.
Heliotrope Architects honors such craft traditions, which may explain the kitchen's deep resonance to Ms. Schneider.
"The kitchen really feels like a collaboration; it really did come out as I hoped," she said. "I now feel connected to this place through this project: It's an homage to the old house and a nod to my husband's Japanese, very minimalist sensibility."

One Final Opportunity to Be Lazy: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Loafers and idlers, including the heads of the Lazy Butt Club, extol the virtues of the not-so-busy life, even as many big companies start cracking down on return-to-office policies.
Early afternoon, late summer. Humid, 83 degrees. The cicadas were whirring outside.
I closed my laptop, got up from the desk in my home office and went to the bedroom. I lay down and began flipping through "The Church of Baseball," a book by the screenwriter and director Ron Shelton about the making of his 1988 movie, "Bull Durham."
My eyelids grew heavy. Instead of fighting off sleep, I put the book aside and gave in to a nap.
These last weeks of summer, when the out-of-office replies pile up and even Wall Street takes a bit of a break from making money, might be the last time for people to be lazy, to loaf, to snooze -- especially with return-to-office policies kicking in for many companies across the country.
Millions of Americans have already been called back to their desks. Now several firms whose employees have continued to work remotely, including Amazon, BlackRock and Meta, are cracking down.
Shortly before Labor Day, the Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy set the tone for fall by telling employees who had yet to return to the office that they had better start going in at least three days a week or, as he put it, "it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon."
With the more flexible, less monitored work days of the pandemic era possibly coming to an end, many people are preparing to bid adieu to the small pleasures of sitting on a porch and looking at the yard, of lingering over a morning coffee. And that's a shame, according to those who believe in the virtues of loafing.
"It's good for you," Tom Hodgkinson, the editor and publisher of the British magazine The Idler, said. "It's when you're idle that the ideas come."
Mr. Hodgkinson, 55, held up the example of Aldous Huxley, the British author and philosopher, who spent a lot of time motoring around France and Italy in a Bugatti with his wife. "Like every man of sense and good feeling," Huxley once said, "I abominate work."
Mr. Hodgkinson, whose books include "How to Be Idle," added that he had just returned from a vacation in Italy, where he read a few books, lounged by the pool and enjoyed leisurely meals with family and friends. That schedule is not so different from his life back in London. He bicycles to his publication's office, often arriving late. Two days a week, he knocks off after lunch to play tennis. He does not own a smartphone.
"There are these moments you can find during the day," Mr. Hodgkinson said, "but we tend to fill them up with phone checking."
Idleness is not the same as sloth, he clarified. "It's about rediscovering your inner philosopher and leaving a bit of time to think and to take time out," he said. "It's really about freedom-seeking."
Many thinkers have similarly embraced the benefits of time away from the grind. The British mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell, in a 1932 essay for Harper's Magazine titled "In Praise of Idleness," proposed a four-hour workday. "I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous," he wrote.
More recently, Tom Lutz published a history of slackerdom, "Doing Nothing," and Kate Northrup wrote a manifesto against being busy, "Do Less." Both authors did not respond to a request to be interviewed -- and good for them.
Lazy Butt Club, a California clothing brand that got its start in the 1980s and has had a resurgence, sells T-shirts and other apparel showing a cartoon duck lounging in a beach chair. The brand's motto: "Encouraging laziness."
"It's a reminder to relax, and that's OK," said Daniel Jay, whose father, Michael, founded the brand. Citing the entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, an exemplar of hustle culture, Daniel Jay added, "In the world of 'Gary Vee,' we are the antidote to that."
The notion of kicking back has lately taken off on social media. In March, Gabrielle Judge, a 26-year-old social media influencer from Fort Collins, Col., coined the hashtag #lazygirljob. The phrase -- and the idea behind it -- went viral.
Ms. Judge said she found herself working at a software company fresh out of college. She earned good money and gained experience, yet increasingly felt disillusioned. "What I realized very quickly was doing great work just meant doing more work," she said. "My lazy girl ethos started to bloom. How can I find a job that still pays the same amount, but it's not using as much of my mental load?"
Ms. Judge has a curious approach to laziness, however. In her time away from her day job, she started a content-creation business centered on the #lazygirljob idea. And now that she's an entrepreneur and influencer, she said, "I don't necessarily have the best work-life balance."
Indeed, the original lazy girl has lately been busy gearing up for a TEDx talk and working on a book. But the ethos isn't really about doing nothing, Ms. Judge explained, but having "agency" over how you spend your time. It's something many people desire, apparently. "That's why you're seeing so much pushback to return to office," she said.
When I woke up from my nap, I went back to Mr. Shelton's book about the making of his baseball movie. I learned that he did his work in the mornings, from 9 a.m. to around noon, before calling it quits to shoot some hoops. That's my idea of a #lazygirljob.

How Jeff Daniels Unlocks His Creativity: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actor, musician and playwright has made a career out of finding ways to stay creative between "Dumb and Dumber" and "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Jeff Daniels has accomplished a lot battling boredom.
Before he moved to New York in 1976, he bought a guitar to play when he wasn't getting work. After he moved back to Michigan in the 1980s, he started getting bored between movie jobs, so he formed the Purple Rose Theater Company. That's why today, in addition to being an actor known for portraying Atticus Finch on Broadway and Harry Dunne in "Dumb and Dumber," Daniels, 68, is an accomplished musician and playwright who sometimes performs a one-man musical at a theater he helped bring to life.
"Alive and Well Enough," his 12-episode audio memoir that Audible plans to release Sept. 7, incorporates skits, bits, songs and stories from his career. It leans heavily on his passion for the work, regardless of whether it resonates on the level of his role in the 1983 film "Terms of Endearment."
"The rush is between action and cut, when you're doing it," Daniels said in a phone interview this month. "The curtain call has always been kind of a silent movie for me. I walk out and I see them, I hear them, but that's not the climax. That's not what happened. For me, by that point, it's over."
Daniels talked about pursuing his other endeavors -- creative and athletic -- while avoiding ticks. These are edited excerpts from the conversation and an email.
'The Beatles: Get Back'
I loved every minute of Peter Jackson's documentary. Seeing the band's creative process, to watch people of that caliber face the same mountain that everybody else does -- whether they're writing a song or a play or a musical or a poem -- was affirming.
Golf in the Backyard
During Covid, when we all had to kind of bunker, our family put together a golf course on our property. We play with plastic balls, and we each use one club. We've got a creek and a pond and some things you have to work around. But you never have a problem getting a tee time, and there's never a slow foursome in front of you.
My Kindle
I love the portable library aspect of it, and I read more because of it. I recently read "Grinning at the Edge," Paul Allen's biography of the playwright Alan Ayckbourn. And I've got Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act" queued up now.
Detroit Tigers
They're young and they're talented and they're getting better every season. For me, it's fascinating to watch the management manage the talent and the contracts and who you need. It's the same uniforms, the same game, the same field, and yet the players change. The cast changes. It's this living, breathing thing that's evolving.
Clearing Your Head in the Woods
Things get unlocked when you're walking or biking through the woods. If you're stuck on something, then just go for a bike ride and wait. Across the street from my house, there's a state recreation area. It's kind of like having 10,000 acres of your own, which you didn't have to pay for. It's terrific, especially in the winter when there aren't any ticks.
Circle Rep
When I went to Circle Rep Off Broadway in the 1970s, they had a whole bunch of playwrights there, including Lanford Wilson and John Bishop. That's where I fell in love with that kind of theater -- live, creating, new play stuff. I wanted to create that creative place at Purple Rose Theater Company, where I'm surrounded by like-minded people who have to do this thing because it's what we do.
'Impractical Jokers'
When I was doing "To Kill a Mockingbird" on Broadway, I would come back to my apartment and turn on the hidden-camera show "Impractical Jokers" to wind down after a show. Whatever Atticus Finch might've watched if he were around, it probably wouldn't have been "Impractical Jokers." It was a way to disconnect from the show and just unplug. And the guys just crack me up.
New York City
I go to New York for the theater -- to see it and be in it -- but also to remind myself of who I am. It's all about the imagination and the art and the creativity, and imagining all those writers who were in New York and kicking around. It's a good place for me to write.
My Guitar
For my entire career, an acoustic guitar has kept me creatively alive. Over the past 20 years, I've played in clubs all over the country, but my regular gig is on my porch looking out at the lake.
Writing, Even When It's Hard
There's a battle to it. But when it happens, when you unlock it and that thing launches you toward your ending in a way that you never saw coming, that's the fireworks. Writing that line that's going to end the scene, and you close your laptop because you're going to take the rest of the day off, that's what keeps you going. You hang onto those euphoric moments.

Debunking the 'Recycling Myth,' Starting With Its Symbol: [National Desk]

Author: Shain, Susan

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/debunking-recycling-myth-starting-with-symbol/docview/2860020977/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many plastics that carry the "chasing arrows" symbol, like soda cups and yogurt tubs, are rarely recycled. A new California law is raising the bar.
Jan Dell is a collector. But instead of art or action figures, she collects what she calls "bad plastic containers." She is a connoisseur and a completist: Her specimens include lids from oatmeal canisters, cups from fast-food joints, cleaners wrapped in shrink sleeves, and many, many Amazon mailers. Each carries the familiar "chasing arrows" recycling symbol; none, she believes, will ever be recycled.
Since 2018, when she gave up her career as a chemical engineer, Ms. Dell has run a one-woman nonprofit, the Last Beach Cleanup, from her home in the hills of Orange County. Her obsessive efforts to end what she calls "the recycling myth" have led to a legal settlement forcing Coca-Cola, Clorox and other companies to modify some of their recycling labels.
Ms. Dell also headed an advisory committee that pushed for a landmark truth-in-labeling law in California. Starting in the fall of 2025, that law will prohibit companies from placing recycling symbols on products that are not widely recycled in the state. Yogurt tubs could be among them. So could baby food pouches. And takeout containers. And coffee cup lids.
In many parts of the country, only plastic bottles and jugs stamped with a 1 or 2 -- like those used for soda, milk and detergent --are reliably recycled. Much of the rest ends up in landfills or polluting the world's waters and shores. The United Nations estimates that humans produce 400 million tons of plastic waste every year.
While accurate labeling may seem a paltry response to this onslaught, Ms. Dell argues that it is one of the most effective ways to curtail waste. More than a third of the world's plastic is used for packaging. And many of the largest makers of consumer goods have promised their packaging will be 100 percent recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. Ms. Dell's hope is that if companies have to acknowledge that they aren't meeting those criteria, they will switch to more sustainable materials. "When they fully admit, oh, we're selling plastic trash," she said, "then that will motivate them to make changes."
Many manufacturers, reluctant to give up the cheap, long-lasting and versatile material, see it differently. They argue that the focus should not be on what currently isn't recycled, but instead on what could be recycled, if only enough money were devoted to educating consumers and expanding infrastructure.
So California's labeling law is also shining a light on a bigger question: When it comes to sustainable packaging, what does progress look like -- investing in making more plastic recyclable? Or investing in alternatives to plastic?
The great label debate
The now-familiar chasing arrows symbol proliferated in the late 1980s and early '90s, when the plastics industry successfully lobbied nearly 40 states to require it on most plastic products. According to an investigation by NPR and "Frontline," the industry knew most plastic would not be recycled. The industry says the numbers were solely meant to help recyclers sort different types of plastics, but the chasing arrows surrounding them became a de facto, if fallible, marker of recyclability to consumers.
In recent years, industry-funded initiatives have developed new kinds of labeling. How2Recycle, which is funded by membership fees from manufacturing giants like Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Target and Amazon, generates labels used by more than a third of the consumer packaged-goods industry. Those labels offer guidance on whether packaging is recyclable -- and if it is, instructions on how to prepare it, like "rinse and replace lid."
How2Recycle claims it is helping consumers recycle more effectively. But Ms. Dell and others suggest that some of the organization's labels encourage people to believe certain plastics can be reprocessed when they can't.
No material sets off this argument more than polypropylene, the plastic marked with a 5 and commonly used for yogurt tubs and margarine containers. Three years ago, How2Recycle downgraded its polypropylene label, telling consumers it wasn't recycled in all communities. Then, last summer, it changed the label back to "widely recyclable."
The decision to revert the designation came after the Recycling Partnership, another industry-funded group, gave $ 6.7 million to recycling facilities to expand their acceptance and sorting of polypropylene.The group now estimates that more than half of recycling facilities in the United States accept and sort the material.
Paul Nowak, the executive director of How2Recycle's parent organization, sees this as a success story. "It shows the program is working because we downgraded it and then the industry got busy and started doing grants and building back up their system," he said.
But Ms. Dell says that even if more facilities accept polypropylene, that doesn't mean they are selling it for reprocessing and reuse; it is more likely going into a landfill or overseas. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that just 2.7 percent of polypropylene containers and packaging was reprocessed in 2018. The Recycling Partnership says its investment, which has now grown to $ 10.3 million, could eventually increase that amount by 42 million pounds per year, but that is still only about 1 percent of the polypropylene produced for containers and packaging in the United States.
While Keefe Harrison, chief executive of the Recycling Partnership, acknowledges that little polypropylene is being turned into new material right now, she argues that more investment in sorting and reprocessing facilities would improve the chances. Polypropylene recycling is at a "tipping point," she said, noting that Oregon is considering including polypropylene on a forthcoming list of recyclable materials that municipalities are required to collect, sort and sell.
This more expansive, "if only" definition of recyclability is a common industry refrain. "Why say, because it can't be recycled today, we should stop claiming it to be recyclable," said Matt Seaholm, president and chief executive of the Plastics Industry Association, "when we actually can invest and improve the infrastructure to get to where it needs to be?"
Part of the debate is what it means to recycle. In a recent memo, the E.P.A. recommended that a material be marketed as recyclable only if it has a "strong end market," meaning it's sold at a price that's higher than what it would cost to simply throw it away. The chasing arrows symbol, the agency said, "does not accurately represent recyclability, as many plastics (especially 3-7) do not have end markets and are not financially viable to recycle." The agency did note, however, that a growing number of recycling facilities are accepting polypropylene.
Judith Enck, a former E.P.A. official and the founder of Beyond Plastics, notes that while recycling centers can accept all kinds of plastic, sorting the myriad types and then cleaning and refashioning each into new materials is a different matter. Contrary to the plastics industry's claims, she argues that no amount of money could meaningfully expand plastic recycling beyond No. 1 and No. 2 bottles and jugs. "Plastic recycling only exists in the minds of public relations agencies that are promoting plastics," she said.
One reason: chemistry. Unlike paper, glass or aluminum, plastics are incredibly diverse. Each type of plastic has its own mix of resins, colors and toxic chemicals. A hard-plastic orange laundry detergent jug and a clear squeezable ketchup bottle "can never get recycled together," Ms. Enck said, because the resulting material would be useless. Even green No. 1 bottles cannot be recycled with clear No. 1 bottles.
Jeff Donlevy, general manager of Ming's Recycling in Hayward, Calif., compared plastic to cheese: Although most cheeses are made from milk, as most plastics are made from fossil fuels, he said, "you just can't melt all that cheese down again and recreate a new cheese that somebody likes."
Even when plastic can be reprocessed, it is more expensive than making it new. With new plastic, Mr. Donlevy explained, you don't have to deal with "paper or glass shards or dirt or food waste" or other contaminants. So there's little incentive for manufacturers to stop using cheap virgin plastic.
Ms. Dell supports recycling No. 1 and No. 2 plastics and she would welcome the industry's help to improve their recycling rates, which hover at just 30 percent. As she put it, the companies could say: "1s and 2s bottles and jugs, that's it, that's all that's ever been recyclable. And now we're going to work on making that better."
"But they won't," Ms. Dell said. "They maintain that it's all recyclable, because why? The plastics industry wants to sell bags. They want to sell forks. They want to sell foam cups."
'We can make such progress'
Under California's new truth-in-labeling law, polypropylene -- and all other plastics -- will qualify as recyclable only if two criteria are met: 60 percent of Californians have access to a recycler that accepts and sorts the material, and 60 percent of the state's recyclers have access to a facility that reprocesses it.
The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, or CalRecycle, is now studying which materials are picked up by recyclers -- and where they're ending up. Once the agency releases its findings next year, companies will have 18 months to change their labels. Manufacturers of single-use packaging and single-use food service products, like cups and utensils, will also face pressure from California's new extended producer responsibility law, which gives them until 2032 to make their products recyclable or compostable.
Because California is such a large part of the U.S. economy, the combined impact of these laws will probably be felt across the country, said Heidi Sanborn, who was chair of the recycling commission that encouraged them. Companies are "already calling and talking to packaging manufacturers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, I don't think No. 6 is going to work anymore,"' she said. "And they're not going to do that just for California."
The plastics industry could certainly push back against CalRecycle's findings. But if the California law works as Ms. Dell hopes, she said, manufacturers will be forced to shift to materials that are reusable or actually recyclable. She's a fan of paper because its production isn't the result of fossil fuel extraction, because it can be composted or recycled, and because to her knowledge, she said, "a paper straw has never killed a sea turtle." Ms. Dell pointed out that Healthy Choice already offers some frozen meals in paper bowls, and that Starbucks uses paper to-go lids in France, which banned single-use plastic cups and plates in 2016.
"We can make such progress," she said, "once we get past this idea that single-use plastics could someday be recyclable."

Full text: On feel-good desk chairs, stylish laundry rooms and game tables you don't have to banish to the basement.
This article is part of our Design special section about new interpretations of antique design styles.
I'm looking for a new, ergonomically correct desk chair -- but I want it to look nice. Is that too much to ask?
Certainly not. These days, plenty of options deliver good looks and comfort. And it's a smart idea to get an ergonomic chair. Studies show that working from home, where one is likely to improvise seating, can lead to increased pain in the lower back and neck -- especially if the worker is sitting improperly. A good chair can help.
At its most basic, the chair should be adjustable (in terms of overall height and armrest positions in particular) and support your lower back to minimize strain and reduce fatigue. You want your forearms parallel to the floor and bent roughly 90 degrees.
Branch Furniture makes particularly swell-looking chairs. Their Ergonomic Chair, which starts at $ 329, has lumbar support, adjusts eight different ways and comes in five colors (black, beige, two grays and blue) with black or white frames. For extra swagger, Branch's Verve Chair is offered in cobalt, mint green, white, coral or navy and is from $ 549.
Less spiffy, perhaps, but top-notch ergonomically, is the classic Aeron chair from Herman Miller, which comes in three sizes to accommodate a wide range of users. It has breathable fabric, adjustable pads for lumbar support and fully adjustable arms. It starts at $ 1,275.
For something different, Humanscale's Freedom Saddle Stool is a triangular seat without a back or arms. The stool supports a healthy lumbar spine and reduces pressure points. It comes in 13 fabrics and two frame colors and starts at $ 352.
I recently knocked over my LED lamp and broke the light source. I called the manufacturer, and it cannot be replaced. What's up with that?
LED technology has advanced tremendously over the past 20 years, and many manufacturers are using what are called integrated LEDs in their designs. These light sources are not standard bulbs that snap or screw into the fixture. As the name suggests, they are part of the lamp itself. LEDs can do all sorts of things regular bulbs can't -- including curve in (nearly) limitless ways, assume extremely slim, flat shapes and remain cool, which allows them to be combined with materials that incandescent bulbs would melt.
The San Francisco-based lighting designer Pablo Pardo notes that integrated LEDs "should never need to be replaced over the life of the product." According to Mr. Pardo, integrated LEDs can last up to 50,000 hours, which translates to slightly more than 17 years when used eight hours a day. His lamps, however, have a plug-and-play design that allows for replacement in the case of damage to the bulb or improvements in the technology.
Mr. Pardo said that most manufacturers didn't offer replacements; break the bulb, and you have to toss out the entire lamp. This has consequences not just for the owner's wallet (a replacement bulb for his company Pablo's Brazo floor lamp costs $ 50, substantially less than the fixture's $ 650 retail price), but also for the environment. If a lamp can be disassembled when the light stops functioning, more parts can be recycled. "Full life cycle is the most responsible and most sustainable approach," he said.
Ping-Pong is something of an obsession in our family, and we want to put a table in our living room. But we want it to look more like furniture and less like summer camp.
Most people are familiar with the standard-issue folding Ping-Pong table made from particle board that is native to basement rec rooms. It supplies hours of fun but is not the prettiest. Game tables -- pool, foosball, Ping-Pong -- have now been invited into living rooms and other public spaces in part because of better designs and higher-quality materials. (I suspect they're also a spillover from open-plan work environments with recreation areas.)
Killerspin's Ping-Pong tables are sleek and often colorful. The Revolution Classic SVR has a matte steel base and purple top and is $ 2,699. Pool Table Portfolio's Arock Lucite billiard table sits on transparent legs, and its Tekku Outdoor pool table works nicely if you have a very large patio. (Prices for both are supplied on request.)
Sean Woolsey is a furniture maker who builds great-looking indoor shuffleboard tables up to 20 feet long with maple and walnut. Prices start at $ 14,000. Kettler's indoor/outdoor foosball table (about $ 1,600) is a major step above the ones found in the backs of bars. And if you're feeling thrifty (or nostalgic) you can still get an old-school Ping-Pong table from HooKung for about $ 100 on Amazon.
Our mud room, where we keep our washer and dryer, is one of the entrances to our home, yet it looks sad and neglected. How can I make it more inviting?
Mud or laundry rooms are sometimes the first spaces guests (and you) see, yet many don't get the love they deserve.
So, make yours look as nice as any other room. Paint the walls an interesting color, coordinating with the washer and dryer. Add a runner or small area rug (use one designed for outdoors if it's regularly going to get wet). Hang wood cabinets if you need them.
Instead of simply screwing in a few hardware store hooks for coats, find a beautiful coat rack. Provide a bench for putting on or taking off shoes or boots. Add a pendant light or chandelier. (Make sure it's high enough so don't hit your head while sorting your colors and whites.)
If you really want to make the room special, install a patterned tile floor or wide oak planks, whichever coordinates best with the rooms that follow.

Cable TV Model Broken, A Giant of Cable TV Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Charter Communications told investors Friday that its fraught negotiation with Disney was a sign of a larger problem with the traditional cable-TV business model.
One of the biggest cable companies in the United States has a message for media companies, its major partners in a decades-old business: The traditional cable-TV model is broken, and it needs to be fixed or abandoned.
Cable TV has become too expensive for consumers and providers, Charter Communications said in an 11-page presentation to investors on Friday, adding that cord-cutters and rising fees are contributing to a "vicious video cycle."
The presentation comes amid negotiations between Charter and the Walt Disney Company, owner of popular cable channels including ESPN and FX, which will not be available to Charter's nearly 15 million pay-TV subscribers until both sides agree on how much Charter will pay Disney to carry its channels. Subscribers to Charter's Spectrum TV service will be without access to the U.S. Open tennis tournament and college football games during a holiday weekend.
These so-called carriage fights are commonplace in the media industry, with channels going dark for days or weeks on cable systems while the two sides -- cable providers and content creators -- haggle over how much the channels are worth and how to bundle them. But Charter's suggestion that parts of its own business model are in disrepair adds a new wrinkle to the crisis facing the cable-TV business.
The fight comes at a time of declining subscriptions: More than five million Americans end their cable-TV subscriptions annually, according to research from SVB MoffettNathanson.
Almost every traditional media company is trying to hold on to its cash-rich cable partnerships while building streaming businesses that will eventually replace those alliances. But investors in traditional media companies have also grown impatient with attempts to build new streaming businesses, saying they are not as profitable as cable TV used to be.
The pressure is forcing traditional media companies to wring cash from their businesses in other ways, including teaming up with competitors to bundle their streaming services.
Adding to the challenges, tech companies like Apple and Amazon are willing to pay top dollar to acquire live sports rights, further driving up programming costs. Cable companies, for their part, have weaned themselves off depending wholly on traditional TV revenue, by offering services like wireless internet.
But in trying to negotiate with Disney for a better deal, Charter's presentation goes a step further, delivering a scathing indictment of the cable television industry, which has generated billions of dollars for companies like itself and Disney for decades. It's a notable acknowledgment from Charter, one of the companies that propelled much of that growth.
"Customers are leaving the traditional video ecosystem, and losses have accelerated," according to Charter's presentation.
"Has the traditional TV ecosystem reached its proverbial tipping point?" said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst for LightShed Partners. "If ESPN is permanently gone from Charter, there will be a massive snowball effect that is catastrophic for traditional TV companies."
Disney fired back at Charter on Friday, saying that the cable giant had rejected a deal that reflected "market-based terms" and that Disney had proposed creative ways to make its streaming apps available to Charter's cable subscribers. Disney said its offer to Charter had included its "most favorable terms" on rates, distribution, packaging and advertising.
"Charter's actions are a disservice to consumers ahead of the kickoff for the college football season on ABC and ESPN's networks," Disney said in its statement.
At issue are the rates Charter will pay for Disney's programming and how those movies and shows will be distributed to Charter's customers in bundles. Charter has said it does not want to pay a premium for channels its customers do not watch, adding that rate increases are pushing customers to cut the cable cord.
Christopher Winfrey, the chief executive of Charter, said on an investor call Friday that he was "disappointed" with the stalemate with Disney. He said the company had proposed an alternative model that Disney would not accept.
"We're either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we're moving on," Mr. Winfrey said.
Charter's news conference prompted a sell-off of traditional media stocks, affecting the broader entertainment industry. Shares of Disney were down nearly 3 percent on Friday, Paramount declined more than 9 percent, and Warner Bros. Discovery fell 12 percent. Charter shares were down more than 3 percent.
As viewers abandon cable television for streaming services like Netflix, cable providers like Charter and Comcast have grown frustrated with paying a premium for content that fewer people are watching through traditional means.
Content providers like Disney are making adjustments of their own. The media giant has said it plans to offer a streaming version of ESPN, one of its most valuable TV channels, which has long been a linchpin of the traditional cable bundle. Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, has said he is exploring options for ESPN, including finding a new partner for distribution or content.
On Friday, Charter said it had proposed a subscription package that included both traditional television and streaming apps, but Disney rejected its terms, said Rich DiGeronimo, president of product and technology. Charter said it was prepared to walk away from Disney's channels, instead adopting "alternate video solutions" that included services offered by Apple and Roku.
Charter has explored splitting off some sports programming, including regional sports networks, into a higher-cost package called Spectrum Select Plus. Mr. Winfrey said Friday that it had not pushed Disney to agree to put ESPN into that package.

At Festival, Adam Driver Backs Actors: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: His film "Ferrari," a big-budget indie from Michael Mann, is the kind of adult drama the major studios have shied away from.
The name placard on the dais said "A. Driver," and if you're making a Ferrari movie, you'd certainly better have one.
This particular Driver happened to be in high demand at the Venice Film Festival, which bowed on Wednesday and has mostly had to make do without famous movie stars as the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike prohibits actors from promoting films made by most major studios. But since the new Michael Mann-directed film "Ferrari" will be released domestically by Neon and internationally by STX -- two companies that aren't members of the group that Hollywood guilds are striking against -- its star, Adam Driver, was free to make the trip to Venice and add A-list appeal to a festival in dire need of it.
"I'm proud to be here, to be a visual representation of a movie that's not part of the A.M.P.T.P.," Driver said on Thursday at the news conference for the film, referencing the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. He praised the interim agreement devised by SAG-AFTRA that allows stars to promote independent films as long as their distributors agree with the terms the actors' guild is seeking.
"Why is it that a smaller distribution company like Neon and STX International can meet the dream demands of what SAG is asking for -- the dream version of SAG's wish list -- but a big company like Netflix and Amazon can't?" asked Driver, who has previously promoted Netflix movies like "Marriage Story" and "White Noise" in Venice. "Every time people from SAG go and support movies that have agreed to these terms with the interim agreement, it just makes it more obvious that these people are willing to support the people they collaborate with, and the others are not."
After the crowd at the news conference applauded, Mann added, "No big studio wrote us a check. That's why we're here, standing in solidarity."
You wouldn't think while watching it that "Ferrari" is an indie movie. With a reported budget of $ 95 million, this is the sort of lavish adult drama that Mann used to make for major studios all the time. But movies like "Heat," "The Last of the Mohicans," "Ali" and "The Insider," all films Mann made in the 1990s or early 2000s, have fallen out of favor in our superhero-saturated era, and expensive prestige releases like this one have recently struggled to break out at the box office.
Can the record-breaking success of Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" reinvigorate the sort of big-budget dad drama that used to be a theatrical staple? "Ferrari" is counting on it, even if its fellow December releases, like "Wonka" and "The Color Purple," don't necessarily lend themselves to "Barbenheimer"-level portmanteaus. ("Wonkari" and "Ferple" just sound like off-brand Pokemon.)
Like Nolan's summer hit, "Ferrari" is about a midcentury visionary with a wandering eye: Driver's Enzo Ferrari is a racer-turned-automaker who's feuding with his wife (Penélope Cruz), hiding a mistress (Shailene Woodley) and trying to save his namesake company before it goes belly up. Mann tracks him during the summer of 1957, when it seemed like so many of Ferrari's problems could be fixed by a single, momentous race. If one of his drivers can win the dangerous, thousand-mile race Mille Miglia, Ferrari reasons, it would stoke enough demand to lift the company's fortunes. Still, his single-minded pursuit of that goal turns out to be a life-or-death matter with all sorts of unexpected casualties.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It may be hard now to conceive of "Ferrari" as a Driver-less vehicle, but over the many years that Mann tried to mount it, the director flirted with leading men like Robert De Niro, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who went on to topline the Mann-produced "Ford v Ferrari" (2019). The 39-year-old Driver is called upon to play a man two decades older for most of the film's running time, but that gray-haired intensity actually suits him: His Ferrari is hard-nosed and compelling, like a too-serious MSNBC commentator who slowly attracts an ardent, horny fan base.
Regardless of whether "Ferrari" can chase the box-office success of "Oppenheimer," Driver said it was a miracle it was made at all, summing up the film's truncated production schedule and false starts in a way that his title character could understand.
"It's hard not to get philosophical about an engine -- the amount of pieces that have to come together, similar to films, and work on the exact right timing in the exact right moment," he said at the news conference. "And then there's the element of human intuition and reflex. It's a 50/50 marriage, and that's very much filmmaking."
When all those different elements manage to coalesce on a premium race car -- or a big-budget indie film -- it's beautiful, Driver said. "It also makes you aware of how many things could go wrong at any moment," he noted. "It's a special thing to be part of."

Value of Norvo Nordisk Is The Highest in Europe
The Danish drug maker Novo Nordisk ended LVMH's two-anda-half-year reign as Europe's most valuable listed company on Friday. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury retailer, has been hurt by growing concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy. Novo Nordisk is meanwhile riding a wave of demand for its highly effective diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which has sent its earnings and shares to record highs. Its shares have risen around 17 percent since it announced on Aug. 8 that a large study had shown that Wegovy also had a clear cardiovascular benefit, boosting the company's hopes of moving beyond its image as a lifestyle drug. As of Friday's close, Novo Nordisk had a market capitalization around $ 424.7 billion including unlisted stock, according to Refinitiv data and company disclosures of its share count. The French-listed LVMH had a market cap of $ 420.1 billion. REUTERS
SAFETY
Thousands of Highchairs Are Under Recall
More than 85,000 highchairs sold at major retailers are being recalled due to a fall hazard that has resulted in a handful of injuries, according to federal regulators. Toy and nursey product company TOMY International Inc. is recalling about 83,000 of its Boon Flair and Flair Elite Highchairs sold in the U.S. -- and another 2,850 in Canada, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based distributor and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. According to this week's recall notice, the bolts securing the highchairs' seats can loosen, allowing the seats to detach. TOMY has received 34 reports to date of the chair separating from the base, the CPSC said Thursday. This has lead to two dozen falls that resulted in 11 injuries. The highchairs were sold through Bed Bath & Beyond, Target, Toys 'R' Us, Amazon and Walmart, TOMY and the CPSC said. The "Flair" highchairs were sold from 2008 to 2009, while the "Flair Elite" models were sold from 2008 to 2017. ASSOCIATED PRESS
TRANSPORTATION
Safety Defect Haulted Norfolk Southern Trains
Norfolk Southern believes a software defect -- not a hacker -- was the cause of the widespread computer outage that forced the railroad to park all of its trains for most of a day earlier this week. The railroad said Friday that it traced Monday's problem to a defect in the software one of its vendors was using to perform maintenance on its data storage systems. Both the railroad's primary and backup systems became unresponsive at the same time. The update was made to one system and then automatically copied to the other system allowing the defect to spread. Norfolk Southern didn't identify the vendor except to call it "a leading global technology provider." The railroad, based in Atlanta, reiterated that it has found no evidence that the outage was caused by "an unauthorized cybersecurity incident." ASSOCIATED PRESS

Comedy
'Kevin McDonald: Superstar (A Rock Opera)'
Aug. 31-Sept. 1 at 7 p.m. at the Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Brooklyn; thebellhouseny.com.
Kevin McDonald, Mark McKinney, Bruce McCulloch, Dave Foley and Scott Thompson of Kids in the Hall have loomed as comedy giants over at least three generations of kids -- from the pilot of their self-named show, which debuted in 1988, to their return to sketch comedy last year on Amazon Prime Video.
Though they're most definitely Canadian in heritage and humor, the members of Kids in the Hall spent a formative year in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan before they were ready for TV. McDonald shared stories and songs about the troupe's early shows at West Bank Cafe (where the opening act was an also-then-unknown Lewis Black) in "Kevin McDonald: Alive on 42nd Street," a revue that ran at Theater Row in 2019. Now McDonald has expanded those true stories into a full-blown rock opera, featuring Jean Grae as the narrator and John Wlaysewski on guitar, with appearances by Robin Rothman, Dave Hill and Julie Klausner.
Tickets are $ 25 at Eventbrite. Thursday's performance is sold out and only a few tickets are left for Friday, but there will be a standby line at the box office each night before showtime. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Bruce Springsteen
Sept. 1 and 3 at 7:30 p.m. at MetLife Stadium, 1 MetLife Stadium Drive, East Rutherford, N.J.; metlifestadium.com.
With more than a half-century of experience, Bruce Springsteen is one of music's most seasoned and consistent live acts. And at 73, he shows little interest in retirement, saying in a 2020 interview that he wants "to burn the house down" as long as he can. Springsteen's seeming indefatigability is good news for fans who missed his New York shows earlier this year. This week, he is returning to the area, performing at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
There have been some minor variations in Springsteen's characteristically lengthy set on his current tour, but he doesn't skimp on the hits, which pack a wallop with backing from more than a dozen members of the E Street Band. "Ghosts," from his most recent album of original material, comes early in the set list, offering something of a mission statement for the evening: "Count the band in then kick into overdrive/By the end of the set we leave no one alive."
Resale tickets to the show are available at varying price points from Ticketmaster. OLIVIA HORN
Helen Sung: Going Big, Band & Beyond
Sept. 1-3 at Dizzy's Club, 10 Columbus Circle, Manhattan; 2023.jazz.org/dizzys-club.
The Houston-born pianist Helen Sung plays with crisp swing and elegant invention, her rhythms drawing from the music's deepest blues roots -- and setting listeners' heads bobbing -- while she explores her own fresh ideas, often inspired from her classical training. (Her sparkling 2021 album, "Quartet+," paired a jazz combo with the strings of the Harlem Quartet, a fit that was natural and illuminating.)
This weekend's concerts find Sung and a large ensemble celebrating the birthday of the hard-bop hero Horace Silver (1928-2014), whose music embraced blues, gospel and R&B with jazz sophistication. Exemplifying the soul-jazz and Blue Note sounds of the 1950s and '60s, Silver, too, caused heads to bob, with beloved tunes like "Señor Blues," "The Preacher" and the epochal "Song for My Father" -- all hard-swinging, crowd-pleasing and perennially cool. Sung is presenting new arrangements of Silver classics for a 16-piece band, drawing on her time spent in the Mingus Big Band and Clark Terry's final big band.
The sets are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, and 5 and 7:30 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets start at $ 25 for students and are available at the club's website. ALAN SCHERSTUHL
Kids
Birds of a Feather
Through Sept. 15 at the New York Botanical Garden, 2900 Southern Boulevard, the Bronx; nybg.org.
Although birds often gather in flowering spaces, some of the New York Botanical Garden's current winged residents aren't ones you would ordinarily expect to see there: vultures and a peacock.
The mixed-media artist Ebony G. Patterson has used models of these creatures in " ... things come to thrive ... in the shedding ... in the molting ...," an exhibition that examines decay and renewal. The Birds of a Feather program, at the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, offers guided activities, inspired by Patterson's work, from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on weekends and Labor Day, and from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. on Tuesdays through Fridays. These include touching and investigating life-size vulture and peacock sculptures that are not part of the show and inventing new species by combining and attaching magnetic bird parts.
Another exhibition-related project for young visitors involves creating glittering mini tapestries that incorporate photos of themselves. They can also make a herbarium specimen and pot up a pothos plant to take home. Weekends feature a story time as well, at 2:30 p.m.
The program is included in grounds admission, which starts at $ 4 for children of New York City residents. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Intimate Epics
Sept. 1-7 at Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn; bam.org.
When BAM began running this almost-annual series in 2019 -- 2020 and 2021 were skipped -- part of the conceit was that every film had to run more than three hours. The theater has since eased that requirement, but this is still a lineup in which Andrei Tarkovsky (with "Solaris," on Friday and Saturday) counts as a master of brevity. The concept is simple: to show features that are scaled for grandeur but are also deeply internal, even cerebral.
Luchino Visconti's "The Leopard" (on Sunday and Thursday) may have breathtaking wide-screen compositions and a gloriously protracted ballroom sequence, but much of the drama occurs inside the head of the Prince of Salina (Burt Lancaster). In 1998, Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" (showing on 35 millimeter on Saturday and Wednesday), with its roundelay of soldiers soliloquizing in voice-over, alienated audiences who expected "Saving Private Ryan." The sweeping, sunlit Inuit saga "Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner" (on Monday and Tuesday), from Zacharias Kunuk, was shot in rough-looking digital Betacam, a choice that offsets the arctic landscapes with an almost claustrophobic feel.

Full text: Catch the final installment of "How To With John Wilson." Or check out a peppy football documentary and a mesmerizing cop show.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I need closure.
'How To With John Wilson'
When to watch: Friday at 11 p.m., on HBO.
"How to Track a Package" is the series finale of this beautiful, distinctive collage, and while I'm heartbroken to lose one of TV's most evocative and humane shows, at least we can be comforted that it goes out on top. John Wilson captures and nurtures marvelous weirdos, delicately and patiently, until you realize: Oh! Quirks are not extraneous accessories to life; they're the foundation and totality of it. If you approach everything as if it has meaning -- misspelled signs, toilet figurines, the differences between 7-Up and ginger ale -- well, then it does.
... a half-hour, and I like teamwork.
'God. Family. Football.'
When to watch: Now, on Freevee.
Just about any football show could be called "God. Family. Football.," but this six-part documentary series in particular follows a high school team at a Christian academy in Shreveport, La. The kids all seem sweet, thoughtful and well-adjusted, even as they discuss the sting of absentee fathers and the toll of various injuries. While this obviously walks in the shadow of "Friday Night Lights" and "Last Chance U," it is going for -- and achieves -- a sunnier, more Y.A. vibe. (If you want a football show with more to say, try "Algiers, America," on Hulu.)
... an hour, and I want something gripping.
'Dark Winds'
When to watch: Sunday at 9 p.m., on AMC, or now on AMC+.
Season 2 of this mesmerizing crime drama finishes this weekend, and it feels like a throwback -- but not just because it is set in the 1970s. "Wind" is bold in ways that have mostly been sanded away on other cop shows: It's more daring in its cinematography, more tense and surprising in its action sequences, and most important, all its secondary, tertiary and even one-off characters feel detailed and richly envisioned. Zahn McClarnon is extraordinary as Joe Leaphorn, a police lieutenant with the requisite sad baggage, but all the performances here are top notch. If you miss the stylistic élan of "Breaking Bad," watch this. Season 1 comes to Max on Friday, and it's a perfect six-episode bleak-and-impressive binge.

Presidential Politics, a Hate Crime and Solitude: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Kenigsberg, Ben

Publication info: Kenigsberg, Ben.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a look back at a presidential primary, a remembrance of the victims of a hate crime and an intriguing visit to a Northwest Atlantic island.
The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we'll choose three nonfiction films -- classics, overlooked recent docs and more -- that will reward your time.
'Primary' (1960)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel and Max. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
The run-up to the presidential primary season is (somehow, already) underway. To see how different the nominating process once was, get a look at Robert Drew's pioneering documentary.
The film has to be watched through the prism of its time. Doubly disorienting, it is a chronicle of the 1960 Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin at a point when the majority of states did not yet hold primaries; it is also a fly-on-the-wall documentary from a moment when that form -- made possible by the increased portability of cameras and sound equipment -- was brand-new. While sitting in the room with John F. Kennedy, then the junior senator from Massachusetts, as he receives news of election returns may seem like the sort of sight you could easily catch on TV today, in 1960 it was an innovative, close-range portrait, offering "an intimate view of the candidates themselves," as the film's opening narration puts it.
Kennedy ran against his fellow senator Hubert H. Humphrey, of Minnesota, who during the events of "Primary" was campaigning only one state away from his home turf. His advantage is said to be with rural voters; Kennedy has strength in cities. The barnstorming seems oddly wholesome and congenial by today's standards. The film shows Humphrey pitching a room of farmers on how the Senate votes he's taken aren't popular in Boston or New York. Elsewhere, cheering crowds greet Kennedy and sing along with his campaign song, a reworked version of Frank Sinatra's "High Hopes." And although much of "Primary" consists of speeches and handshaking, it gives the sense of having captured the national conversation in microcosm. Some voters express the fear that Kennedy's Catholicism would influence his politics. One woman says she favors him precisely because he is Catholic.
Drew, who takes a "conceived & produced" credit as opposed to calling himself a director, went on to make other films with Kennedy, such as "Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment," which followed the Kennedy administration's actions to support the integration of the University of Alabama in 1963. "Primary" may end with its two candidates on roughly even national standing from where they started, but it inaugurated the direct-cinema movement. People who worked on it -- including Albert Maysles and D.A. Pennebaker as cameramen -- went on to make groundbreaking documentaries of their own.
'4 Little Girls' (1997)
Stream it on Max. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
Next month will mark 60 years since the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., an act of terrorism that killed four girls. Their deaths, Walter Cronkite says in an interview in Spike Lee's moving documentary, became an "awakening" for Americans who had, until that point, failed to understand "the real nature of the hate that was preventing integration."
Lee's documentary, edited by Sam Pollard ("MLK/FBI"), leads by honoring the victims. The film opens with Joan Baez singing "Birmingham Sunday," written in response to the bombing, over images of the graves and faces of the four girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Rosamond Robertson and Cynthia Wesley. We then hear recollections from friends and family members who knew them. McNair's parents, Maxine and Chris, recall how painful it was to explain to Denise, at around age 6 (she died at 11), why she wasn't allowed to order from a lunch counter. A friend of Wesley's, Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski III, remembers Wesley's sense of humor and kindness, and how they parted with the words "see you Monday," not knowing what that Sunday would bring.
"4 Little Girls" also features interviews with civil rights leaders like the Rev. Andrew Young and the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who walks viewers through how he barely survived another bombing in 1956. (The commentators, billed as "witnesses" in the credits, include Howell Raines, the executive editor of The New York Times from 2001 to 2003, who wrote extensively about the events.)
But almost unavoidably, Lee's most memorable interview is with the former Alabama governor George Wallace, a proud segregationist who now claims that his "best friend is a Black friend." He insists on bringing his aide, Eddie Holcey, before the camera. "Ed come over here, just one minute," he says. "Here's one of my best friends right here." Holcey, whom Wallace barely seems to look at directly, and who glances offscreen to make a sort of eyeroll, appears profoundly irritated at how Wallace is using him.
'Geographies of Solitude' (2023)
Rent it on Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The naturalist Zoe Lucas first visited Sable Island -- a beachy strip that is less than one mile wide, and that lies 100 miles off the coast of mainland Nova Scotia -- in 1971. Since then, she has become a tireless and largely solitary cataloger of life on the island: its hundreds of wild horses, its invertebrates and its seabirds, among other animals. She is heard discussing the possibility of finding species that don't exist anywhere else. The diets of the birds, who have a tendency to eat plastic, are one indicator of levels of pollution in the ocean, another trend that Lucas tracks.
In "Geographies of Solitude," the filmmaker Jacquelyn Mills, while not a naturalist (to be fair, she is credited as director, editor, cinematographer, sound recordist and producer), takes an approach to this documentary that is, in its way, similar to Lucas's. Both women see boundless possibilities in the island's treasures. Mills draws on natural elements to make cameraless short films that wouldn't be out of place in a Stan Brakhage retrospective. With a contact microphone, she and Zoe record the sounds made by the wood of a decaying A-frame on the island. She finds out what happens to film stock when it is buried in horse dung. She hand-processes film in seaweed and electronically renders music out of the crawling of a Sable ant.
Mills's work is interspersed throughout the movie, which becomes a striking combination of environmental documentary and profile. It's also a landscape film that makes a real effort to attune viewers to sights and sounds, and that gently dips its toe into the avant-garde. Late in the film, Lucas says it appears that her life is Sable Island -- "that's all I have, that's all I do, all the time," she notes, adding, with a hint of regret, "I lost track of everything else." "Geographies of Solitude" isn't quite immersive enough to make that happen. But it captures a world where cameras seldom go.

Full text: ECONOMY
Growth in Second Quarter Is Revised Downward
The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.1 percent annual pace from April through June, showing continued resilience in the face of higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, the government said Wednesday in a downgrade from its initial estimate.
The government had previously estimated that the economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate last quarter.
The Commerce Department's second estimate of growth last quarter marked a slight acceleration from a 2 percent annual growth rate from January through March. Though the economy has been slowed by the Fed's interest rate increases, it has managed to keep expanding, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending.
The report on the nation's gross domestic product showed that growth last quarter was driven by upticks in consumer spending, business investment and outlays by state and local governments. ASSOCIATED PRESS
EARNINGS
Salesforce Raises Forecast on Demand for Software
Salesforce raised its annual revenue forecast on Wednesday and projected quarterly sales above estimates as it benefits from a recent price increase and resilient demand for its cloud and business software offerings.
The results fan optimism about a recovery in technology spending in the second half of 2023 after earnings from major cloud players, including Amazon and Google, suggested that the slowdown was nearing an end.
Salesforce has also tried to increase demand by integrating artificial intelligence into its offerings like Slack and launching a generative A.I. product, Einstein GPT, for salespeople, customer support agents and marketers.
The company expects revenue to be between $ 8.70 billion and $ 8.72 billion in the third quarter, compared with estimates of $ 8.66 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Quarterly earnings per share forecast also exceeded estimates.
"We're leading our customers into the new A.I. era," Salesforce's chief executive, Marc Benioff, said in a statement. REUTERS
SEMICONDUCTORS
Bosch Seeking U.S. Aid to Expand in California
The top executive at Bosch said on Wednesday that the German company needed subsidies from the U.S. government to carry out the full expansion it planned for a California chip plant it was acquiring.
In April, Bosch said it planned to buy key assets of TSI Semiconductor's chip production facilities in Roseville, Calif., and invest $ 1.5 billion to retool the site to make silicon carbide chips, which can help boost the range of electric vehicles. Production at the new company, Robert Bosch Semiconductor, will start in 2026.
On Wednesday, Bosch said California had approved a $ 25 million tax credit for the factory.
Bosch's chief executive, Stefan Hartung, said during a trip to San Francisco that expanding the facility to the intended full size "depends on the support of the U.S. government, or the regional government or the California government, and it is already supported by some, but obviously it needs more support."

A Mexican Resort Thriller and Four More Picks: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/mexican-resort-thriller-four-more-picks/docview/2858547731/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a Mexican resort thriller, a British time-travel caper and a coming-of-age drama from Costa Rica.
'Time Share'
Stream it on Netflix.
If "White Lotus" were directed by Ari Aster, it might look something like this creepy Mexican resort thriller from Sebastián Hofmann. At a snazzy tropical time share recently acquired by a global franchise, Pedro (Luis Gerardo Méndez), his wife and their son encounter a series of mishaps that teeters between amusingly odd and disturbingly sinister.
Their misfortunes begin when they've barely arrived for their vacation and learn that their villa has been double-booked. Faced with a comically inept staff, they now have to share the house with a rube-ish family of five. Meanwhile, in the bowels of the resort, a depressed laundry worker, Andres (Miguel Rodarte), and his saleswoman wife, Gloria (Montserrat Marañon), are being put through some strange training program by their new American executives, who want to mine the couple's traumas for profit-making schemes.
The ruthlessness of global capitalism, the emotional labor of the hospitality industry and the fragility of masculinity all become targets of Hofmann's slippery satire, which derives its power from its ambiguities. Is Pedro right in suspecting his newfound roommates of foul play, or is his patriarchal pride just wounded? Is Andres being controlled by his bosses or rightfully treated for an illness? There are no clear answers in "Time Share," but the film will leave you deliciously confused, unsettled and wary of the charms of vacation resorts.
'Rival'
Stream it on Amazon.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Marcus Lenz's border-crossing feature is a film of quiet surprises and formidable performances. "Rival" opens in rural Ukraine, where 9-year-old, freckle-faced Roman (Yelizar Nazarenko) is suddenly pulled out of his life of play when his grandmother dies. Soon, he is smuggled in the back of a truck to Germany, where his mother (Maria Bruni) works -- without papers -- as a caretaker for a newly widowed elderly man, Gert (Udo Samel). When Roman realizes that Gert might soon become his stepfather, he begins to lash out, until a gutting rug-pull sends the man and the boy on the run together.
For all its high-stakes plotting, "Rival" is an extraordinarily gentle film that dwells in wordless moments of connection, particularly as Gert and Roman, who do not speak each other's languages, try to communicate. If Gert seems a little seedy at first, he turns out to be wonderfully tender; Roman, with his wide blue eyes and feral love for his mother, is menacingly unpredictable yet fiercely lovable -- a child caught in a world of loss he doesn't understand. Through the boy's naïve gaze, Lenz sketches out the precarity of contemporary immigrant life, leaving us not with hope or resolution, but only a childlike rage against the world.
'Beatrix'
Stream or rent it on dafilms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Summer is a time of both joy and melancholy: brimming with sunshine and leisure, yet ephemeral and transitory, a fleeting prelude to the harshness of winter. This debut feature by the Austrian directors Milena Czernovsky and Lilith Kraxner distills that bittersweet mood perfectly. It drops us into the daily routines of a young woman, Beatrix (Eva Sommer), who is biding the dog days alone in a beautiful country home that doesn't seem to be her own. There is something slightly out of place and hesitant about the way she goes around the house, as if she is slowly learning its surfaces.
We simply observe Beatrix as she mills about, watches TV, feeds the cat, takes phone calls and occasionally has friends over for dinner. Their conversations are not about anything in particular, and the film doesn't enlighten us about Beatrix's back story or desires. Instead, we are invited to simply feel the passing of time alongside her, in colorful, saturated tableaux that heighten the tactility of her verdant surroundings. Little happens per se, yet "Beatrix" leaves you feeling both sated and light, as after a summer lunch -- glad for having experienced it and a little sad that it's over.
'Lola'
Rent it on Apple TV.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This debut feature from the Irish director Andrew Legge is a marvel of lo-fi sci-fi, that microgenre of speculative cinema that conjures grand, fantastical worlds from the simplest of materials. Here, archival newsreels and black-and-white 16-millimeter footage transport us to 1940s Sussex, England, where a pair of orphaned sisters -- Martha (Stefanie Martini) and Thomasina (Emma Appleton) -- have invented a device that can intercept radio and television broadcasts from the future. They call it Lola, and use it to tune into music and pop culture years away -- Bob Dylan is a revelation, as is David Bowie -- until they realize that their janky gadget could have groundbreaking implications for the war effort.
They quickly run into the classic conundrums of time-travel tales: Their God-like ability to anticipate and tweak the future sets off unintended consequences and unfurls a revisionist version of World War II. What's remarkable is the film's minimalist elegance in bringing these ideas to life. Digitally altered newsreels insert the characters into history, while intimate, mockumentary-style camerawork creates the illusion of having stumbled upon an authentic time capsule from the past.
'I Have Electric Dreams'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Valentina Maurel's sunbaked Costa Rican drama takes a familiar genre -- the coming-of-age of a teenage girl -- and spikes it with poetry, beauty and violence. Sixteen-year-old Eva (Daniela Marín Navarro) struggles with the fallout from her parents' divorce. She and her sister live with their well-to-do mother, whom Eva irrationally resents, while she idealizes her father, a hippie poet with anger issues. Stability and wisdom on one side, danger and wild freedom on the other -- it's no surprise that Eva chooses the latter, but her mom is prescient when she says, "The obsession you have with your dad, and all the men that come your way, is something that'll pass, mark my words!"
A combustible feeling of naturalism courses through "I Have Electric Dreams." The hand-held camera traipses around restlessly, following Eva, and the actors -- particularly Reinaldo Amien Gutiérrez as the father -- embody a capriciousness that makes their characters impossible to pin down. The result is a film that feels wholly, messily human, with its empathetic yet cleareyed visions of the love and hurt that often tangle together in families, binding us to our kin almost in spite of ourselves.

Full text: Research has shown that the messier your space is, the more easily you'll be distracted by all of the visual stimuli around you. Wirecutter's work-from-home team tested the best ways to keep your home office organized. Here are some things you can do. JENNI GRITTERS
Tame your cords. Start with a pack of Velcro Brand one-wrap thin ties. Collect all of the cords that snake around and on top of your desk, and thread them around the back, where you can't see them. Then gather groups of cords into bundles, secured with the cable ties. You can also opt for a cable sleeve, especially if you rarely unplug or move the cords in question.
Organize your documents. Next, it's time to sort through all of the papers on your desk and put anything that you need to access often in a desktop organizer. You can also add in sticky notes, pens and whatever else may be cluttering your space. After that, find the items that you need to archive, including birth certificates, estate plans and financial documents. Scan these important pieces and add them to a digital file system like Dropbox.
Put everything in its place. To organize the chaos of loose papers strewn across your desk, consider storing them in labeled folders. Use a label maker, such as the Brother P-touch Cube Plus, to designate folders, bins and shelves as landing spots for stray items.
Create an inspiring desk space. Set up a more functional desk space with a whiteboard, like the Quartet Glass Whiteboard Desktop Easel. Use it to take notes on what needs to happen during the week. Then choose two items to tackle on any given day and cathartically erase them when they're complete. Another item to consider is the Wayber Dual-Sided Desk Pad, which protects your desk from spills and sweaty glasses. And your mouse will glide smoothly over its surface.
Get rid of things you don't need. After you've decluttered your space, you likely have a pile of electronics to get rid of. They shouldn't go into a landfill because heavy metals and harmful chemicals can leach into soil and water systems. Consider repair and reuse options like iFixit, or trade in devices at Amazon, BestBuy, Apple and Dell. Also consider recycling options by contacting your city's sanitation department. Before you donate tech, be sure to wipe your data from the device.

Trucks, Cars, Bikes Battling for Space: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Online Retailers Are Taking Advantage of a Public Resource: City Streets," by Christopher Caldwell (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 19):
The reason those Amazon trucks are double parked is that the parking spaces are already full of private cars.
Most private cars spend more than 95 percent of their life parked. (On average, Americans drive less than an hour per day.) This is an incredible waste of resources -- the natural resources consumed to build the car and the public space devoted to storing the car when not in use.
For densely populated cities like New York, the delivery trucks are not the problem. The cars are.
Having a handful of delivery trucks, full of packages, wend their way through the neighborhood making deliveries is far more preferable than having everyone in the neighborhood driving their cars back and forth to the store. It reduces congestion and is far more fuel-efficient, and by extension creates a much smaller carbon footprint.
The delivery trucks will become even more efficient if they no longer have to sit in the congestion created by private cars and can more easily park directly in front of the delivery location.
The long-term goal should be to largely remove private cars from the city, and to expand mass transit, biking, walking and the use of delivery services.
Robert Constant
East Rockaway, N.Y.
To the Editor:
While criticizing large e-commerce companies for their ubiquitous delivery vans, Christopher Caldwell also strangely casts blame on the most affordable and least space-intensive mode of transport: the bicycle.
Though the average new car in America costs roughly $ 48,000, and car ownership increases steadily with income, he sees those riding bikes as "elites." It's a tired, and empirically inaccurate, claim that treats every car trip as essential and every bike trip as leisurely and discretionary.
Mr. Caldwell quotes someone asking how those of us who travel by bicycle get our groceries, incorrectly assuming that we cannot carry food home in backpacks, panniers and baskets.
If his goal is less noise and air pollution, fewer traffic fatalities, less carbon emissions and more play space for children, the humble bicycle will bring us closer to these manifold goals.
Given that he evokes Jane Jacobs in his defense, Mr. Caldwell may want to consider that she was the consummate urban cyclist and successfully fought to reduce on-street parking and preserve vibrant urban streets.

Treating Water From Nuclear Plants
To the Editor:
Re "Japan Is Setting an Awful Example With Fukushima's Water," by Azby Brown (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 23):
Mr. Brown's criticism of Japan's plan to discharge water treated by the Advanced Liquid Processing System (A.L.P.S.) at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station is illogical and unfair. For years, comprehensive studies on A.L.P.S.-treated water were conducted, and alternatives were considered in consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Discharging the treated water into the sea was determined to be the best method when considering risk management, and an I.A.E.A. report recently concluded that Japan's procedures are consistent with international safety standards. Furthermore, the amount of tritium in the water is less than what is regularly discharged from nuclear power plants around the world, including those in China.
We have held over 1,500 meetings with interested parties domestically and internationally, and many have welcomed the I.A.E.A.'s conclusion.
Monitoring results for tritium concentrations in seawater will be reported daily. Japan remains fully committed to providing information based on scientific evidence in a transparent and timely manner for people across the world, particularly those who have suffered from harmful rumors and disinformation.

Mark Meadows's Official Duties
To the Editor:
Re "Meadows Asks Judge to Shift Georgia Case to U.S. Court System" (news article, Aug. 29):
Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff, argues that his work on the Trump campaign was part of his official duties.
Really? By law, campaign work cannot be part of one's official duties. It is a violation of the Hatch Act to do any campaign-related work while on the job, and he may be incriminating himself. Any work on or for a campaign needs to be done after hours and not on the taxpayers' dime.

Abortions to Save the Mother
To the Editor:
Re "After Ballot Losses, Where Does the Anti-Abortion Movement Go Next?," by Jane Coaston (Opinion, nytimes.com, Aug. 21):
Ms. Coaston's interview with Kristin Hawkins, an anti-abortion activist, included a phrase that is new to me: "maternal-fetal separation." Ms. Hawkins said this term is used for a medically necessary termination when the fetus would otherwise not survive a full-term pregnancy.
Well, jeez, is a thing not a thing when we call it something else? Do abortion opponents want to fool themselves by using new terminology? Or are they finally coming to terms with the science, which shows that pregnancy does not always result in a healthy birth?
Pre-eclampsia, ectopic pregnancy and early rupture of membranes are only three of the serious complications of pregnancy, and they all can endanger the mother's life.
Women with kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension and cancer often need lifesaving medical treatments which may harm or kill a fetus. If they opt not to have these diseases treated in order to protect the fetus, they could die.
I am ardently pro-choice, and I've listened to the "no abortions ever" arguments for decades. They've all seemed to completely ignore the health of the pregnant woman. If Ms. Hawkins and her cohorts can now bless the concept of maternal-fetal separation, I'd call that a good first step.

Hungry College Students Need Help
To the Editor:
Re "A Food Pantry That Keeps Hunger at Bay for Needy College Students," by James Barron (New York Today newsletter, nytimes.com, Aug. 14):
Mr. Barron's recent report about the Purple Pantry shines a powerful spotlight on a widely overlooked problem: food insecurity among college students. With a shocking one in three college students facing hunger, charitable programs like the Purple Pantry can only serve as temporary solutions to a systemic national economic and social crisis.
Federal safety net programs like SNAP provide the most effective and efficient response to college hunger, but I am deeply concerned that college students and others are falling off a hunger cliff now that emergency SNAP allotments are expiring and some in Congress want to limit these lifesaving benefits.
With Congress turning its attention to the 2023 Farm Bill, this is a critical opportunity to enact the Enhance Access to SNAP Act and other sensible anti-hunger policies that seek to remove harmful and burdensome "work for food" rules.

Studios' Labor Negotiator, Usually Coy, Has Lead Role: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Carol Lombardini, the studio voice in union talks, values a low profile. That hasn't kept striking writers and actors from casting her as a villain.
As the Hollywood union strikes have dragged on, key characters have taken turns in the spotlight.
There is Fran Drescher, the comedic actress who, with surprising ferocity, has rallied the actors' union against television and film companies, and enraged studio executives in the process. Robert A. Iger, who leads Disney, publicly pushed back against the striking workers, and found himself jeered on picket lines as a robber baron.
But one crucial participant has remained an enigma: Carol Lombardini, 68, the top union negotiator for studios and a 41-year veteran of Hollywood labor battles.
For someone who sits at the center of two increasingly bitter strikes -- writers walked off the job on May 2, followed by actors on July 14 -- very little is known about her. Ms. Lombardini has not given an interview of more than a few words since 2009, when she ascended from the No. 2 job to become president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that bargains on behalf of the eight largest entertainment companies.
Until now, her tenure had been marked by labor peace. Studios reached an agreement with the directors' union in June; the writers last struck in 2008, the actors in 1980. Over the years, she has told colleagues that cultivating a public persona would only undercut her effectiveness at the bargaining table. Or at least it would not help. She declined to comment for this article.
Wanted or not, the spotlight has found her. Many union members blame her for the negotiating logjam that has brought almost all movie and television production in Hollywood to a halt. Partly because of her woman-of-mystery persona and partly because she's an easy target, Ms. Lombardini has become an avatar for the grievances of tens of thousands of striking workers. "Carol can go kick rocks," Caroline Renard, a striking writer, said this month on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
With her public personality absent, actors and writers have invented one. In May, someone started a parody account on X that has portrayed Ms. Lombardini as a crass tyrant declaring, "I'm a goddess of chaos!" (Yes, she has seen it, an associate said. No, she is not amused.)
Another group of screenwriters have mocked Ms. Lombardini online as a fuddy-duddy who hangs out at chain restaurants, the taunt being that no Hollywood person would be caught dead in one. (Her office is near a Cheesecake Factory in suburban Los Angeles.)
Other union members seem to have simply grown curious about the Oz-like negotiator behind the curtain. "Will we ever find out what Carol Lombardini is in the flesh?!" Maridia Minor, a writer, asked on X last week.
A few facts are known about Ms. Lombardini. She is a devoted baseball fan. She grew up in a working-class town outside Boston. And of course, she has enormous power. Ms. Lombardini is responsible for negotiating all 58 of Hollywood's union agreements, from contracts with the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, to ones with the American Federation of Musicians and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. How she handles herself -- union officials who have negotiated with her describe her as blunt yet cordial -- can make the difference between smooth talks and a strike.
Jeff Ruthizer, who spent 40 years as a labor negotiator at Disney, ABC and NBC and recently wrote a book, "Labor Pains," drawing on that experience, called Ms. Lombardini "a funny person" who "knows how to read a room and is tough when she needs to be."
At the end of the day, however, Ms. Lombardini is an employee, albeit one whose duties require deft ego management. She answers to moguls like Mr. Iger of Disney and Ted Sarandos of Netflix, who are not used to managing by committee. The other alliance members are NBCUniversal, Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon, Paramount Global and Sony Pictures. Ms. Lombardini advises them on a course of action, but they ultimately decide on a strategy and then she does their bidding.
In late July, for instance, some company leaders pressed Ms. Lombardini to reopen negotiations with the Writers Guild. (The two sides had not met since early May.) While not adamantly opposed, Ms. Lombardini expressed skepticism; she was not convinced that the Writers Guild was ready to soften its stance, according to two studio chiefs and one studio labor lawyer involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ultimately, the companies directed her to re-engage with the writers.
The subsequent talks have gone poorly, with the Writers Guild holding firm to demands related to staffing minimums in television writers' rooms and transparency into streaming-service viewership, among others. Frustrated, studio leaders told Ms. Lombardini on Tuesday to release the details of their sweetened proposal -- which included higher wages, a pledge to share some viewership data and additional protections around the use of artificial intelligence -- to the news media. It was essentially a strategy to go around the guild's negotiating committee and appeal to rank-and-file members.
In a message to its 11,500 members on Thursday, the Writers Guild said it was "undeterred by this latest tactic."
The Writers Guild declined to discuss Ms. Lombardini. Other unions did the same. (SAG-AFTRA, whose contract covers tens of thousands of movie and television actors, has not returned to the bargaining table in more than six weeks.) It appears, however, that union leaders have a grudging respect for her.
"She's been around a long time, and she knows what she's doing, and she commands a lot of respect as well," Lindsay Dougherty, the lead Teamsters organizer in Hollywood, said in an interview with an entertainment trade news publication last year.
"I think she's a fair individual," Ms. Dougherty added. (Teamsters represent drivers, casting directors and animal handlers, among other Hollywood specialties.)
Ms. Lombardini, an avid Red Sox and Dodgers fan, had a working-class upbringing in Framingham, Mass., and was inspired to become a lawyer by reading articles about F. Lee Bailey, according to an associate. After getting a bachelor's degree in Renaissance history from the University of Chicago and a law degree from Stanford, she started her career at law firms in Los Angeles, specializing in labor by happenstance after one firm moved her from its quiet trusts and estates department to its bustling labor one.
She has worked at the studio alliance since its creation in 1982 and is married to William Cole, a prominent labor lawyer whose clients have often included studios.
"Carol has one of the most complicated jobs in Hollywood -- and it's growing even more so -- but I think she clearly understands and appreciates the challenge," said Barry M. Meyer, a former Warner Bros. chairman who worked closely with Ms. Lombardini. "It's actually been an integral part of her life's work."
By all accounts, Ms. Lombardini knows various union contracts cold, which is no small feat; the most recent Writers Guild contract ran 740 pages. Ms. Lombardini is not a zealot in the negotiating room, according to union officials who have sat across the table from her, but she can be brusque and unyielding. In a letter to its members this month, the Writers Guild said Ms. Lombardini would not engage on certain topics. "Carol's response -- something she repeated three times during the meeting: 'People just want to get back to work."'
In the past, studio leaders have prized her efficiency. "Carol has done a very good job this past year," Kevin Tsujihara, who was the Warner Bros. chairman, wrote in a 2014 email that was made public as part of the Sony Pictures hack, noting that she had recently concluded six negotiations.
"There was no public drama and all were concluded within parameters we had established," Mr. Tsujihara wrote. He recommended a bonus of $ 365,000, or 30 percent of her salary, which he listed as $ 1.2 million.
The job has become much more difficult. For a start, the studio alliance's relatively recent additions of Apple, Netflix and Amazon have made its priorities more varied and unwieldy than in the past. The unions have grown more aggressive. And bargaining issues -- the rise of artificial intelligence, for instance, and its potential to disrupt the creative process -- have become more complex.
"She has to unify the various views of the studios and get everyone to agree," Mr. Ruthizer, the labor lawyer, said. "And then she has the other job of negotiating with the other side of the table."
"The challenge now is greater than she's ever seen," he added. "It's bigger than anybody has ever seen."

With her public personality absent, actors and writers have invented one. In May, someone started a parody account on X that has portrayed Lombardini as a crass tyrant declaring, “I’m a goddess of chaos!” (Yes, she has seen it, an associate said. No, she is not amused.)
Another group of screenwriters has mocked Lombardini online as a fuddy-duddy who hangs out at chain restaurants, the taunt being that no Hollywood person would be caught dead in one. (Her office is near a Cheesecake Factory in suburban Los Angeles.)
Other union members seem to have simply grown curious about the Wizard of Oz-like negotiator behind the curtain. “Will we ever find out what Carol Lombardini is in the flesh?!,” Maridia Minor, a writer, asked on X last week.
A few facts are known about Lombardini. She is a devoted baseball fan. She grew up in a working-class town outside Boston. And of course, she has enormous power. Lombardini is responsible for negotiating all 58 of Hollywood’s union agreements, from contracts with the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, as the actors union is known, to ones with the American Federation of Musicians and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. How she handles herself — union officials who have negotiated with her describe her as blunt yet cordial — can make the difference between smooth talks and a strike.
Jeff Ruthizer, who spent 40 years as a labor negotiator at Disney, ABC and NBC and recently wrote a book, “Labor Pains,” drawing on that experience, called Lombardini “a funny person” who “knows how to read a room and is tough when she needs to be.”
At the end of the day, however, Lombardini is an employee, albeit one whose duties require deft ego management. She answers to moguls such as Iger and Netflix’s Ted Sarandos, who are not used to managing by committee. The other alliance members are NBCUniversal, Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon, Paramount Global and Sony Pictures. Lombardini advises them on a course of action, but they ultimately decide on a strategy and then she does their bidding.
In late July, for instance, some company leaders pressed Lombardini to reopen negotiations with the Writers Guild. (The two sides had not met since early May.) While not adamantly opposed, Lombardini expressed skepticism; she was not convinced that the Writers Guild was ready to soften its stance, according to two studio chiefs and a studio labor lawyer involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ultimately, the companies directed her to reengage with the writers.
The subsequent talks have gone poorly, with the Writers Guild holding firm to demands related to staffing minimums in television writers’ rooms and transparency into streaming-service viewership, among others. Frustrated, studio leaders told Lombardini on Tuesday to release the details of their sweetened proposal — which included higher wages, a pledge to share some viewership data and additional protections around the use of artificial intelligence — to the news media. It was essentially a strategy to go around the guild’s negotiating committee and appeal to rank-and-file members.
In a message to its 11,500 members Thursday, the Writers Guild said it was “undeterred by this latest tactic.”
The Writers Guild declined to discuss Lombardini. Other unions did the same. (SAG-AFTRA, whose contract covers tens of thousands of movie and television actors, has not returned to the bargaining table in more than six weeks.) It appears, however, that union leaders have a grudging respect for her.
“She’s been around a long time, and she knows what she’s doing, and she commands a lot of respect as well,” Lindsay Dougherty, the lead Teamsters organizer in Hollywood, said in an interview with an entertainment trade news publication last year.
“I think she’s a fair individual,” Dougherty added. (Teamsters represent drivers, casting directors and animal handlers, among other Hollywood specialties.)
Lombardini, an avid Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers fan, had a working-class upbringing in Framingham, Massachusetts and was inspired to become a lawyer by reading articles about F. Lee Bailey, according to an associate. After getting a bachelor’s degree in Renaissance history from the University of Chicago and a law degree from Stanford, she started her career at law firms in Los Angeles, specializing in labor by happenstance after one firm moved her from its quiet trusts and estates department to its bustling labor one.
She has worked at the studio alliance since its creation in 1982 and is married to William Cole, a prominent labor lawyer whose clients have often included studios.
“Carol has one of the most complicated jobs in Hollywood — and it’s growing even more so — but I think she clearly understands and appreciates the challenge,” said Barry Meyer, a former Warner Bros. chair who worked closely with Lombardini. “It’s actually been an integral part of her life’s work.”
By all accounts, Lombardini knows various union contracts cold, which is no small feat; the most recent Writers Guild contract ran 740 pages. Lombardini is not a zealot in the negotiating room, according to union officials who have sat across the table from her, but she can be brusque and unyielding. In a letter to its members this month, the Writers Guild said Lombardini would not engage on certain topics. “Carol’s response — something she repeated three times during the meeting: ‘People just want to get back to work.’”
In the past, studio leaders have prized her efficiency. “Carol has done a very good job this past year,” Kevin Tsujihara, who was the Warner Bros. chair, wrote in a 2014 email that was made public as part of the Sony Pictures hack, noting that she had recently concluded six negotiations.
“There was no public drama, and all were concluded within parameters we had established,” Tsujihara wrote. He recommended a bonus of $365,000, or 30% of her salary, which he listed as $1.2 million.
The job has become much more difficult. For a start, the studio alliance’s relatively recent additions of Apple, Netflix and Amazon have made its priorities more varied and unwieldy than in the past. The unions have grown more aggressive. And bargaining issues — the rise of artificial intelligence, for instance, and its potential to disrupt the creative process — have become more complex.
“She has to unify the various views of the studios and get everyone to agree,” Ruthizer said. “And then she has the other job of negotiating with the other side of the table.”
“The challenge now is greater than she’s ever seen,” he added. “It’s bigger than anybody has ever seen.”

Full text: Here is a second round of readers' creative "variations."
William Shakespeare Revisits His Sonnet 18
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"
That likening hath never been less apt
Today, our summers kindle flood and flame,
To which humanity might not adapt
That summer I once dared to denigrate,
Compared to now, was such a pleasant place
I fear this torrid tempest won't abate,
What spiteful irony I now must face!
I once lamented summer's fleeting span;
In hindsight, there was much I hadst to learn
"Eternal summer," 'tis a frying pan:
Without a change of course, the world will burn
My modest sonnet, fate hath cruelly read
Now, summer only warms my heart with dread.
Joel Watson
San Diego
The Gettysburg Regress
Four score months, almost seven years ago, our voters brought forth on this continent a new president, conceived in Queens, and dedicated to the proposition that "when you're a star, they let you do it."
Now we are engaged in a great culture war, testing whether that president, or any president so conceived and so dedicated, can elude censure. The internet is the great battlefield of that war, with some very fine people on both sides. We have come to dedicate a large portion of our field of attention to websites and apps as the final resting place for our opinions that they may live forever. It is not altogether fitting or proper that we should do this.
And, among the nonsense, we can no longer enjoy the love we make -- in case we accidentally procreate -- with abortion newly struck down. The brave women, living in dread, who struggle in fear, have old men to blame for it, and deserve nothing less than to have us now act.
The world must long note, and long remember, what he did on Jan. 6 after an election year. It is for us the voters, then, to be dedicated without fear to the unfinished but necessary work of eternal vigilance.
It is for us the voters to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that in spite of what we may have seen on Reddit, we take increased devotion to that cause of facts over emotion -- that we hereby resolve that Gold Star families shall not have grieved in vain -- that this nation, however odd, shall only give birth to freedom -- and that, though we may not always get what we want from our leaders, we always get what we vote for.

Their Least Favorite Things
(to the tune of "My Favorite Things")
Library shelves have begun to look lonely
Filled with the books deemed acceptable only
Gone are the classics we all read in school
Revising history's the new golden rule
"Slaughterhouse-Five" and "The Sun Also Rises"
Wallflowers, Handmaids, and "Lord of the Flies"-es
Mockingbirds, Cuckoo's Nests, Mice and Men too
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings? I do. Do you?
Facing history is no mystery, cruel truth often stings
So people remove the "uncomfortable" themes
And all their least favorite things
Parents irate, still their lists aren't completed
"Gone With the Wind," where the South was defeated
These books weren't burned yet the flames have been fanned
Instead of fire, no, these books have been banned
Jay Gatsby's gone and poor Anne Frank is hidden
Calls of the Wild are now strictly forbidden
Books of all stripes both the new and the old
Once warmed our hearts, now they're out in the cold
Who's deciding, what needs hiding, and what books are fine
If there is a ban that you want to enforce,
Please tell your own kids, not mine!

The Ballad of SCOTUS (or Thomas's Promises)
(to the tune of "June Is Busting Out All Over")
Cash is pouring in all over,
The court is a great big money tree!
Lots of billionaires pursue me
And the gifts they offer to me
Are expensive and extensive as can be!
Yachts to take me to Bermuda!
Planes to whisk me off to France!
Though it may appear unseemly,
I will rule for you supremely,
Every time I have the glimmer of a chance.
Because it's June! June! June!
Rulings come in June! June! June!
Decades of progress will be smashed,
Once all your checks are duly cashed!
Money's pouring in all over!
Stare decisis is kaput.
With the help of Sam Alito
Roe v. Wade is now finito --
And I'll soon be crushing Griswold underfoot!
Money's pouring in all over!
I'll be at your beck and call!
Ev'ry fabulous vacation
Makes me lower your taxation
To the point at which it won't exist at all!
Because it's June! June! June!
Rulings come in June! June! June!
Tossing aside with bad intent
Every last shred of precedent.
Perks are pouring in all over!
Travel's more splendid than before.
With your money in my pocket
I'll devote my shadow docket
To the N.R.A., Big Pharma and much more!
Cash is pouring in all over!
Ev'ry decision can be bent:
Though my rulings may be lawless,
Still my reasoning will be flawless
When I tell them what our founders really meant!
Because it's June! June! June!
Rulings come in June! June! June! ...
They'll be coming Soon! Soon! Soon!!!

The Aspirational Dream
(to the tune of "The Impossible Dream")
To dream aspirational dreams
To fight those who said that I lost
To tear into all who contest me
To win irregardless of cost
To grab everything that I want
To fire everyone I've employed
To lie when the truth is for losers
To feed my insatiable void
This is my quest
I'm winner takes all
No matter how stupid, or who has to fall
And though I berate those who counter my will
If they'd done what I told them to do I'd be president still
And I know if my lawyers can sell this new lie overreach
That I might not get tossed into jail
'Cause it's freedom of speech
And my world will be better for this
When my foes lay prostrate at my feet
Ashamed that they failed to subdue me
The leech, the unteachable, unimpeachable, the unreachable star!
And I'll always dream aspirational dreams
Donate to me! The unleashable czar!

2023 Gifts for The 12 Days of Christmas
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me:
Twelve NFTs
Eleven forests burning
Ten migrants trudging
Nine bots a-tweeting
Eight cows a-belching
Seven drones a-spying
Six trolls a-doxxing
Five plastic sporks!
Four Covid tests
Three face masks
Two climate skeptics
and a cartridge for an AR-15.

Denial
I'm living in a land that's called Denial.
You're welcome to come visit for a while.
The locals speak with eloquence and reason.
The climate is delightful every season.
The air is fresh and clean; the rain is mild.
The waterways are clear and undefiled.
The Lexapro is plentiful and free,
But no one needs it here, not even me.
And people from all backgrounds get along.
The schools are good; the infrastructure's strong.
Elections feature meaningful debate,
With neither side inflaming fear and hate,
And no one says they've won when they have lost
And tries to get a valid outcome tossed.
Deceptive news is never on the air,
And commenters online are kind and fair.
This paradise is very hard to find ...
I wish it were a place outside my mind.

Brookline, Mass.
Political Campaign Ballad
(to the tune of "Both Sides Now")
I show up at each county fair
Tell everyone how much I care
Make promises of just hot air
I've talked to crowds that way
But now sometimes I can't get through
I start to talk, they start to boo
So many things I planned to do
But crowds got in my way
I've looked at crowds from both sides now
From good and bad and still somehow
It's crowd's illusions I recall
I really don't know crowds at all
I tell them I love everyone
I want to be their favorite son
Vote for me, I'll get things done
I've looked at gov. that way
But now the polls say I'm behind
My gov. campaign starts to unwind
I did it all, but now I find
I gave myself away
I've looked at gov. from both sides now
From high and low and still somehow
It's gov.'s illusions I recall
I really don't know gov. at all
I traveled to most every place
And kissed the babies on their face
And sold my soul to win the race
I've looked at strife that way
But now it's just another show
I give my spiel, and they all know
My campaign has nowhere to go
And strife now rules the day
I've looked at strife from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's strife's illusions I recall
I really don't know strife at all

Arlington, Va.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The popularity of true-crime content has led some women to create binders containing personal information, a list of exes and even DNA.
Christina Murray printed all 53 pages of the document and wrote down her information. There was space to fill in the make and model of her car; her exes and their last known addresses and phone numbers; and any debts she owes.
The document advised including a recent photo of herself ("high resolution, if possible") and descriptions of tattoos and identifying scars. One page left room for Ms. Murray, a 36-year-old clinical director in New Hampshire, to log her fingerprints and passwords to her social media accounts. She then printed two copies: one that she keeps in her apartment, where she lives alone, and one that she gave to her employer's human resources department.
The concept of the "If I Go Missing" folder was popularized partly by the juggernaut true-crime podcast "Crime Junkie" in the summer of 2018 when the hosts, Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, talked about what they keep in theirs, including logins, a written will and a list of "anyone that I think -- right now there's nobody, knock on wood -- would have a grudge against me," Ms. Flowers said.
The proliferation of the "If I Go Missing" folders (sometimes called "In Case I Go Missing" folders), which can be self-made or purchased in e-commerce sites like Amazon and Etsy, reflects the popularity of true-crime documentaries and podcasts.
Some women say the folders are a way to feel control in what can feel like an out-of-control world -- but detractors say paranoia and a glamorization of victimhood are at the center of the phenomenon.
Adam Golub, a professor of American studies at Cal State Fullerton who studies true crime and culture, said those well versed in the true-crime world know who or what is going to get the most attention. "This is a way to try to intervene in that," Professor Golub said. "It's an attempt to exert some kind of control over your world."
And podcasts, documentaries and shows sometimes have a vested interest in amping up the fear. The "Crime Junkie" podcast, for one, requires users to submit an email address to download the free template they posted shortly after the hosts discussed theirs (this is where Ms. Murray got hers).
Professor Golub thinks there is both "genuine fear and genuine pleasure" involved in creating the binders: fear of being a victim and pleasure in imagining yourself as one. "It's almost this cosplay or fan fiction where you imagine yourself as a future victim, and you're trying to prepare this binder so people can discover you. It's not unlike doomsday preppers."
Intense media coverage of violent crimes may make them seem more common than they are, he added. "We've moved through a pandemic, we have an epidemic of gun violence," Professor Golub said. "And so there is a way that we've been living lives that feel less safe and less certain."
Death is an uncomfortable fact of life. The likelihood of being the victim of a homicide is less than 0.01 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (and if it does happen, data shows most victims knew their perpetrators; for women, it is most likely to be a current or former romantic partner). But there is a much greater chance of dying by other means, such as an accident in the home or on the road, and many companies market their products not as repositories for possible clues for the police, but aids for grieving family members. (The website for one company, Nokbox, encourages consumers to "leave memories, not a mess.")
Markia Brown, a 30-year-old who works in the finance sector from Los Angeles, ordered a binder from a company called Savor after seeing a TikTok video about it. The concept made sense to Ms. Brown as a retired military member. "We have a saying in the military: 'Obviously you hope for the best but you plan for the worst,"' she said. "It brings me a sense of peace knowing that I was proactive instead of my family having to be reactive in the event of an emergency."
And Ms. Brown knows she faces higher rates of violence as Black women are statistically three times more likely to die of homicide than white women, and their missing-person cases stay open four times longer than those of white women. News coverage often focuses disproportionately on white women and children, according to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Criminology, Criminal Justice, Law & Society, a phenomenon that the journalist Gwen Ifill called "missing white woman syndrome."
The binders remain a pretty niche trend -- even for people who work in crime. Tony Im, a public information officer for the Los Angeles Police Department, said he was unaware of the existence of the folders, but said that they could come in handy. "It's like giving us a pile of tips to solve the crime," Mr. Im said. "We'll take all tips."
On TikTok, the hashtag #incaseIgomissing has over 68 million views, with some creators sharing the preparation of their own folders -- and others spoofing the entire concept. ("Most likely I've been taken from the trail in the woods by my house," one said. "But it also could be from the Panera that I go to about once a day.")
Riley Humphreys, a 24-year-old graduate student in forensic medicine, made a TikTok post questioning the practice. In an interview, Ms. Humphreys said she initially thought the binders were satirical because they seemed so absurd. She wondered how the police would be able to use a DNA sample without being able to confirm the chain of custody -- who has handled an asset, such as a sample of hair, along with when and why -- of that evidence, but mostly she worried about what the popularity of true-crime podcasts had done to the women who are listening to them.
"The influence it's having, specifically on women's brains, is a net negative," Ms. Humphreys said. "It capitalizes on people's fears and anxieties and I find that pretty scummy." In a video viewed over seven million times, she finishes by saying that obsessing "over being the victim of a violent crime is insane and bad for your mental health. So, don't do this."
But Ms. Flowers of "Crime Junkie" takes umbrage with the term "paranoid" to describe these actions: "We like to use the term 'preparanoid,"' she said through a spokesperson. "We don't live in the paranoia all day every day, but we will take extra steps to try to protect ourselves and our loved ones."

To Create the Ideal T-Shirt, Start at Home: [Style Desk]

Author: Cook, Grace

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first time Erik Allen Ford, a founder of the clothing brand Buck Mason, tried on one of its T-shirts, it fit so badly that he thought the shirt was on backward.
"It was humbling," Mr. Ford, 40, said of trying on that early T-shirt, which was made in Los Angeles with cotton grown in the United States. "It was the beginning of 50 iterations," he added. "I slept in the sample room for a week."
It was in 2013, not long after Mr. Ford and Sasha Koehn, another founder, had started the label in Los Angeles with a lofty goal: to make a superior T-shirt, a garment that emerged in the 19th century and that countless brands have tried to refine since.
The Buck Mason founders had little experience in apparel design, aside from some pattern-making classes Mr. Ford had taken. He had previously worked in sales and management for a couple of small clothing brands. Mr. Koehn, 41, had worked in media and, before that, as a landscape architect.
Now Buck Mason sells almost a dozen different short-sleeve T-shirts, which start at $ 45. Over the past decade, the brand has also started to sell other basics like jeans, sweatshirts and button-up shirts on its website and at the 24 stores it has opened in the U.S. But T-shirts represent a sizable chunk of its business, accounting for about 30 percent of all sales, Mr. Ford said.
Mr. Koehn called T-shirts "the gateway into the brand." They have been recommended by Vogue, New York magazine and Wirecutter, the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
Of the roughly 500,000 T-shirts produced annually by Buck Mason, about 300,000 are made at domestic factories, with fabrics that are also made in the United States, said Jay Shaw, the brand's head of supply chain.
Buck Mason touts its domestic manufacturing to market products on its website, labeling some as made in the United States and others as made with materials fabricated or grown in the country. According to a survey released in June by the polling firm Morning Consult, over the past year, about two thirds of participants sought to buy products that were made in America.
Usama Jawed, who lives in Manhattan and works in cybersecurity, said he owned 15 Buck Mason T-shirts and he appreciated the brand's efforts to manufacture products domestically. Mr. Jawed, 35, added that some of the T-shirts he had bought were made in America, and others were made overseas. Those made domestically, he said, have held up better than the others.
Old Factory, New Chapter
All the domestic factories used by Buck Mason had been contracted by the company until December, when it bought a sewing factory and an associated cloth mill in Pennsylvania.
Both sites have since become involved in producing what Mr. Koehn identified as Buck Mason's most popular men's T-shirt: a $ 45 crew-neck style made with a specialty cotton known as Pima (or Supima), with curved seams meant to follow the natural slope of shoulders and angular sleeves meant to flatter biceps.
The founders had been looking into building a new factory in Texas, Mr. Ford said, when he got a call from a friend about the factory in Mohnton, Pa., and its associated mill in neighboring Shillington. Both sites had been in and out of operation since they were opened in 1878 and in 1906.
Days after speaking with his friend, Mr. Ford said, he went to visit Mohnton. (He lives in Sewickley, Pa., a four-hour drive away; Mr. Koehn lives in Los Angeles.)
The factory and the mill had previously been owned by Stitch Fix, a company that offers online personal styling services. It bought the facilities in 2017 from Gary Pleam, 79, whose ancestors had opened them, and whose family had continuously operated them until Mr. Pleam sold them to Stitch Fix.
About five dozen people lost jobs when Stitch Fix ceased operations at the factory and mill in November, Mr. Ford said. Some of them, he added, had been working at the sites for decades.
"All those skills would have been lost," he said.
By March, the facilities had reopened as Buck Mason Knitting Mills, and several of the employees who had worked at them for Stitch Fix had been rehired.
The cloth mill in Shillington has started to produce fabrics for Buck Mason's T-shirts and other tops using cotton grown in California, Georgia and Texas. Albert Bareika, who was hired by Buck Mason as the mill's knitting lead in January, said there were plans to release a limited-edition T-shirt made with fabric produced at the facility on a 1940s-era Singer Supreme machine. Its Singer Supreme machine is one of a few still in operation, added Mr. Bareika, 66, who lives in nearby Leesport, Pa., and had previously worked for Stitch Fix at the mill.
At the Mohnton factory, some employees are responsible for cutting and sewing T-shirts, while others iron them by hand or package them for shipping. About 10,000 T-shirts are made there a month, Mr. Ford said. "By fall, we aim to double the capacity," he added. "The goal is to quadruple it."
The factory in Mohnton, a small borough in Berks County, Pa., produced hats and military uniforms before shifting to T-shirts, said Mr. Pleam, who lives in the borough. During the facilities' heyday, in the late 1970s, the factory and mill employed about 100 workers, and the factory made about 22,000 T-shirts a week using fabrics from the mill, he said.
Mr. Bareika, who has worked at mills in the region for decades, said that in the years that followed, such facilities' futures became less certain as some companies started to seek cheaper manufacturing operations overseas or in Mexico.
"The textile trade went elsewhere," he said, adding that many local jobs went with it.
Buck Mason's takeover of the factory and mill has brought only so many back -- 17 people are now employed at the factory, and three at the mill. "It's not a lot of jobs," said Eric Burgis, the mayor of Mohnton, who was elected in 2021.
In an interview at Mohnton's borough hall, about a 15-minute walk from the factory, Mr. Burgis rattled off the names of other businesses in the area. "We have five Walmarts within a 20-minute drive, two Targets, and two Lowe's" stores, he said.
Elizabeth Cruz, 33, was working at an Amazon warehouse near Mohnton before she was hired by Buck Mason as a production associate at the factory. She said both companies offered comparable pay -- $ 18.35 an hour at Amazon, $ 19 an hour at Buck Mason. But the factory job offered a better schedule, she added, and a shorter commute from her home in Shillington.
Close to the Needles
Mr. Ford said "the dream" was to employ 100 people at the facilities. Since Buck Mason took them over, he has visited every few weeks. Mr. Koehn has made fewer trips. On a recent visit to the factory by both, in late July, Mr. Ford recited the sample-size measurements of Buck Mason's most popular men's T-shirt from memory, as if he were giving his phone number.
"The sleeves are seven inches, the chest is 40, the sweep is 40," he said. "The neckline binding -- the double-stitched hem around the collar -- is seven-eighths of an inch deep."
While hovering over a gray T-shirt that was laid out on a desk inside the factory's grading and marking studio -- a room where fabrics are examined and patterns are adjusted and sized to ensure consistency -- Mr. Ford explained how workers had started to use protractors to measure the circumference of T-shirts' necks.
Mr. Koehn said it would be more affordable to produce T-shirts in China, and even cheaper to make them in Vietnam. The ability to market products as made in America isn't the only benefit to producing items domestically, he added. Another is quality control. "The closer you are to the needle, the better something is going to be because of how easily you can get involved," as he put it.
But Buck Mason's founders still prioritize bottom lines. Certain items, like the brand's Japanese denim jeans ( $ 148) and its cotton-twill button-up shirts ( $ 128), are mostly made in Vietnam, India and Indonesia, Mr. Koehn said, because producing them domestically would not be as profitable.
The founders, who are planning to open seven new stores by the end of the year, including a new flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan's Flatiron district, said they saw their investment in the Pennsylvania facilities as an important step in the evolution of Buck Mason. A step that they hope will help their brand become as well known for domestically made T-shirts as Levi's has become for jeans, and Carhartt has for overalls.
"There is nothing more essential to the American wardrobe than a white tee," Mr. Ford said.

Hip-Hop, Weights and Lots of Ice Cream: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Denzel Rodriguez, a 21-year-old from Harlem, works every summer at a local ice cream shop in between TV and film gigs.
Denzel Rodriguez has mastered the ice cream scoop.
"The flick of the wrist is important," said Mr. Rodriguez, 21, who goes by Zel. "You also want to wet the scooper. And once the ice cream is in the cup or cone, give it a tap with the scooper to make sure it's a perfect circle."
This is his third summer practicing his technique, working May to September at the family-owned scoop shop Sugar Hill Creamery in Harlem. In his free time he also writes songs, but his true passion is acting. He has appeared in several television shows, including CBS's "Blue Bloods," and a film released in April called "Showing Up," starring Michelle Williams, Hong Chau and André 3000. "My character was there to spark up some fun," he said.
Mr. Rodriguez, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Honduras, grew up in public housing. "I've seen the bad and good in this neighborhood," he said. "That's taught me that life isn't about your environment, and your environment doesn't define who you are. What you do and your actions define who you are."
That thinking, he said, has pushed him to work harder on his creative pursuits and "surpass what society expects me to be."
Mr. Rodriguez lives in West Harlem with his parents, Toribia Rodriguez, 56, a home attendant, and Saul Rodriguez, 56, a maintenance worker, and his 28-year-old sister Lillian.
MUSIC AND MOVEMENT I let my body wake me up around 9 or 10 a.m. I say a prayer about my day and thank God for everything. Tomorrow isn't always a promise, so I'm just thankful for today. For the next hour, I work out. I throw on some tunes: a hip-hop, R&B mix of 1,059 songs. I start off with weights, do some planks and end with cardio.
My parents are already up when I walk into the kitchen. My mom is nice enough to make me a hot green tea. She's usually cooking, or she's on the couch next to my dad, who is watching soccer while music is playing. They do a lot at the same time.
SEEKING INSPIRATION I chill in my room and scroll Instagram while listening to beats on YouTube from the TV. I don't have a specific artist or type of beat I listen to. I play whatever until something catches my ear. I try to apply lyrics to something that speaks to me. I'm writing songs on my phone. I'm storytelling. Sometimes it's my fantasies or what I want for the future. Sometimes I rap and speak my truth. I have 12 songs completed. It takes me a month to write one. I want to perfect it, but I'm learning to let the song be what it is because I have to put it out there. It's therapeutic and a way to express myself.
FAMILY LUNCH My mom made salmon and rice earlier, so I'll have that for lunch. I love living with my folks. New York is really expensive. I didn't go to college, but I'm working hard, and they know that, so they don't give me a hard time about moving out. I'm mostly in my room doing my thing, but it's comforting to have them here.
TV TIME I watch basketball highlights on YouTube or "The Shop: Uninterrupted," about young Black celebrities talking about life and their success, like Michael B. Jordan, LeBron James and Damson Idris. I just finished "Beef" on Netflix and "Swarm" on Amazon Prime. Now I'm watching "I'm a Virgo." It's a trippy show about a giant trying to navigate the world.
SHIFT STARTS By 3:40 p.m. I've showered and dressed for work. I take the M2 on 130th and 7th Avenue, or ride a Citi Bike, and head to work. July and August are prime time, where the store is hitting its peak. We have 32 flavors, plus four main ones: Brown Bombshell, blueberry cheesecake, vanilla and peach cobbler.
I go right into work mode. I can scoop for 50 to 60 people during a shift. From 4 to 6 p.m. we usually have more kids than adults. They've been to the pool or the park; they come in with friends or with their parents. Most people are from the hood, but we also get tourists who are visiting Harlem. The kids love adding gummy bears; the adults like colored sprinkles, which are a classic, or Oreos. If I'm not scooping, I'm doing online orders, cleaning and ringing up customers. Everyone does everything here.
NEXT WAVE I have a 30-minute break either at 6:30 or 7 p.m. I'll go to the corner store and get a turkey, bacon, egg and Cheddar cheese sandwich. This is the post-dinner crowd. Families come in. Online orders become intense. A line forms, which can go from inside to outside. The longest line I've seen happened during the pandemic: It went around the corner and up the block. We sell more brownie sundaes during this time, or people get pints to go so they can eat it after dinner at home or save it for the week.
EVENING RUSH From 8 to 10 p.m. the line gets bigger and more online orders come in, because people want ice cream before we close. We limit tastes to two, because we are so busy. My favorite is seeing repeat customers or when people ask me my name, because that means I did a good job or they like how I approached them. I make their scoop with love, as if I'm making it for myself.
I hit a wall at 9:30 p.m. but push through. At 10 p.m. the closed sign goes up. Someone is always trying to get ice cream after we close. I offer them a pint, and if we didn't put away the scoopers, I'll give them a scoop.
CLOSING UP We clean up until 10:45 p.m. I walk home because it's summer and nice outside. At home I visit my friends Eric and Siah, who live in my building on the ninth floor but in separate apartments. We play NBA 2K, a basketball video game, where we are on the court playing against each other. Then we listen to beats and rap freestyle.
By 12:30 or 1 a.m. I'm back home. My parents are knocked out in their bedroom. I shower and watch some anime on YouTube. Right now its Netflix's "Naruto," which is about a young ninja hoping to be accepted by his friends and trying to be a leader of his village. I fall asleep watching that.

Instacart Reports Profit Ahead of Anticipated I.P.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nearly 30 percent of Instacart's revenue came from advertising, and grocery orders were flat in the first half of this year, the company said.
Instacart, the grocery delivery business that boomed during the pandemic, took a step on Friday toward an initial public offering that will be a test of Wall Street's appetite for tech start-ups after a yearlong industry slump.
In an offering prospectus that gave the first public look at its financials on Friday, Instacart revealed that unlike other gig economy companies, it has managed to turn a profit. But growth of its core grocery delivery business is slowing.
If it is successful, Instacart's public offering could clear a path for many more from tech start-ups. At least 1,400 private tech companies worth $ 1 billion or more have been waiting for a more favorable I.P.O. market, said Brianne Lynch, head of market insights at EquityZen, an online marketplace for private stock.
Just 100 companies with market valuations over $ 50 million went public in the United States last year, compared with 397 in 2021, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks listings. New public listings have also been scant this year, though Arm, a chip maker owned by SoftBank, also filed an offering prospectus on Monday.
"Instacart and Arm are going to be ones that other tech companies eagerly watch because there is this pent-up demand to go public," Ms. Lynch said.
Instacart rode the tech industry's boom and slumped with the rest of the industry when the sugar rush of online pandemic activity faded. The company laid off workers last year and slashed its $ 39 billion valuation -- first to $ 24 billion and then to about $ 10 billion -- as it struggled to adjust.
Instacart is the straggler among high-profile gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash that have gone public in recent years despite being a long way from profitable -- though Uber is inching closer.
The company earned $ 428 million in profit in 2022, compared with a $ 73 million loss the year before, according to the prospectus. It said $ 358 million of that came from what it described as a tax benefit. Grocery orders in 2022 grew 18 percent from 2021, but orders in the first half of this year were flat compared with a year earlier, the company said.
Instacart has shifted its business away from reliance on low-margin delivery services to higher-margin online advertising. That change has helped the company's bottom line. The company earned $ 740 million from ads and other revenue last year, making up nearly 30 percent of Instacart's overall revenue, which was $ 2.5 billion.
The company began building its ads business in 2019, allowing brands to pay for product placement inside the Instacart app to pitch grocery items to customers while they are shopping. Last year, it also started selling software to the grocery retailers it works with.
Brittain Ladd, a consultant for the grocery industry, said Instacart was smart to diversify into advertising, but he was skeptical of how much more room there was to expand its grocery delivery business.
"They're not facing a future of significant growth in their core business," Mr. Ladd said.
Instacart was founded in San Francisco in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, now 37; Max Mullen, 37; and Brandon Leonardo, 38. Mr. Mehta, the company's chief executive at the time, raised $ 2.7 billion in funding for the company from top Silicon Valley investors including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins.
As it has grown, expanding into thousands of cities across North America, Instacart has faced increasing competition from rivals like DoorDash, Gopuff and Amazon. Gig companies' reliance on independent contractors, who are responsible for their own expenses and do not earn a minimum wage or have health insurance like employees do, has also led to fierce conflict with labor activists who contend that gig drivers and shoppers are exploited and underpaid.
The pandemic supercharged Instacart's growth. Sales quadrupled from 2019 to 2020, Instacart said, and continued on a strong pace through early 2022. The company acknowledged that the boom in grocery delivery was unlikely to repeat itself, but said the Covid spike set it up for long-term success.
"While we do not expect our pandemic-accelerated growth rates to recur in future periods, our growth during this period helped establish a business with much greater scale and much higher gross profit," Instacart said.
When Instacart's growth began to slow in 2021, Mr. Mehta approached Uber and DoorDash about selling his company to them or striking a partnership, The New York Times previously reported. He stepped down from his role as chief executive after a series of tense discussions between himself and the company's board of directors. Fidji Simo, a rising star at Facebook who led the social network's video division, took the top job as chief executive.
In its offering prospectus, Instacart lists risk factors including its history of losses, its dependence on relationships with retailers, stiff competition from nine companies and the newness of its advertising business. It also said it had a new investor: PepsiCo. The packaged foods company said it would invest $ 175 million in new shares in a private placement as part of Instacart's I.P.O.
The company's largest shareholders include Sequoia Capital and D1 Capital, according to the prospectus.
Instacart plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol CART.

Eager for Finale, 'Bachelorette' Fans in Washington Were Left Brokenhearted: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Fans of the reality show were not happy after a local ABC affiliate showed a preseason game between the Washington Commanders and Baltimore Ravens instead.
Fans of "The Bachelorette" reality television show who live in the Washington, D.C., area were unable to watch the finale of the show's 20th season on Monday night. It turns out their ABC affiliate showed an N.F.L. game instead -- and a preseason one at that.
If you know any "Bachelorette" fans, you can probably guess how the Washington-area ones felt about this particular programming call.
"I was pretty frustrated," Pegah Moradi, 25, who lives in Arlington, Va., said by phone early Tuesday.
"It's more important for sports to be live, obviously, than it is for a prerecorded reality show finale," said Ms. Moradi, a graduate student. "But at the same time, it's difficult when something that you're accustomed to viewing at a certain time is just not there."
The practice of cutting one must-watch TV broadcast for another, more common in the past, has become rare in the streaming era. If something is important enough to broadcast live these days, networks and streaming platforms can usually find a way to do that.
But on Monday, the "Bachelorette" finale was shelved in the D.C. area by ABC's local affiliate in favor of a football game between the Washington Commanders and the Baltimore Ravens. (The Commanders won, 29-28, after kicking a field goal in the game's waning seconds.)
"It might be because the two football teams are regional favorites that people are obsessed with," said Julia Swift, a professor in the Division of Communication and Creative Media at Champlain College in Burlington, Vt. "But people are also obsessed with 'The Bachelorette."'
N.F.L. policy mandates that games that air nationally -- on cable networks like ESPN or on streaming services such as Amazon Prime -- are broadcast on free, over-the-air television in the local markets of the participating teams. This is so fans can see their hometown teams play, even if they don't have cable or a subscription to a streaming service, Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman said in a statement.
The network, in this case ESPN, arranges with a local affiliate of its choice to broadcast the game in the teams' markets. Neither ESPN nor the local ABC affiliate, WJLA, provided comment on the matter.
ABC, the majority owner of ESPN, did not respond to questions about why the game was aired in lieu of the "Bachelorette" finale, but a spokesman said that the episode would be available Tuesday on streaming platforms such as Hulu and that fans could sign in with their cable provider to stream it online.
The "Bachelorette" finale was available on Charge!, an over-the-air broadcasting network owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Charge! is free and does not require a paid subscription. But some fans, including Ms. Moradi, had never heard of it and could not figure out how to watch.
Professor Swift said that it would have made more sense to air the episode on a streaming platform that belongs to ABC or Disney, the network's corporate parent. (WJLA, the ABC affiliate that showed the game instead of the finale, is owned by Sinclair.)
The latest season of "The Bachelorette," a spinoff of "The Bachelor" and "Bachelor in Paradise," stars Charity Lawson, a real-life child-and-family therapist from Georgia who is looking for a life partner. Ms. Lawson, 27, began the season with 25 suitors; by the finale, she was down to three.
The ABC affiliate that cut the finale likely did so after calculating that more people would watch the football game, said Amanda Lotz, a professor of media studies at Queensland University of Technology in Australia who has studied the U.S. television industry.
Whatever the reason, the decision illustrates how the federal policies governing American television today were designed decades ago to promote "local sovereignty" by giving local affiliates discretion over what to air, said Professor Lotz, the author of "We Now Disrupt This Broadcast: How Cable Transformed Television and the Internet Revolutionized It All."
The concept of "local sovereignty" may sound anachronistic in the streaming era, she added, "but these were policies that were designed to protect local community differences so that they wouldn't be overrun by the creation of a national culture."
One way to read Monday's scheduling call would be as a kind of karmic victory for football fans, who were famously denied the ending of a nail biter of a game between the Jets and the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 17, 1968. With 50 seconds left, the television broadcast cut out abruptly to make way for "Heidi," a made-for-TV children's movie about a Swiss orphan.
As for "The Bachelorette," Ms. Moradi said she understood that the Commanders and the Ravens are both in her television market and have local fan bases. "But a preseason N.F.L. game versus the finale of a major franchise TV show is not a very difficult decision to make in terms of what to broadcast," she said.
After her viewing plans were scrambled on Monday, Ms. Moradi inadvertently saw a spoiler for the show as she searched for how to watch. At this point, she said, she wonders if watching the finale will even be worth her time.
"Everyone I know who was watching it will have already seen it, for the most part, so I'll just kind of be in the dark for 24 hours," she said. "I won't get to join in on this rare experience: watching live TV at the same time as everyone else."

Nvidia Revenue Doubles on Demand for A.I. Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales for the current quarter will nearly triple their total a year ago, said the company, which makes chips essential to the development of A.I. systems.
In a sign that the tech industry's next big boom is picking up steam, Nvidia on Wednesday predicted rapid growth in the already rabid demand for the chips it makes to build artificial intelligence systems.
The Silicon Valley company's products, called graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create the vast majority of A.I. systems, including the popular ChatGPT chatbot. Tech companies ranging from start-ups to the industry's giants are fighting to get their hands on them.
Nvidia said heavy demand from cloud computing services and other customers for chips to power A.I. systems caused revenue for its second quarter, which ended in July, to jump 101 percent from a year earlier, to $ 13.5 billion, while profit surged more than ninefold to nearly $ 6.2 billion.
That was even better than what Nvidia had projected in late May, when its $ 11 billion revenue estimate for the quarter stunned Wall Street and helped push Nvidia's market value above $ 1 trillion for the first time.
Nvidia's prediction and lofty market cap became a symbol for the growing exuberance surrounding A.I., which is transforming many computing systems and the way they are programmed. They also sharply raised the interest in what Nvidia might say the next time about chip demand for its current quarter, which ends in October.
Nvidia projected third-quarter sales of $ 16 billion, nearly triple the level a year ago and $ 3.7 billion more than analysts' average expectations of around $ 12.3 billion.
The financial performance of chip makers is often considered a harbinger for the rest of the tech industry, and Nvidia's strong results could reignite enthusiasm for tech stocks on Wall Street. Other tech companies like Google and Microsoft are spending billions and making little on A.I., but Nvidia is cashing in.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry. "The number of applications is just quite spectacular," he said in an interview after a conference call with analysts. "Every single data center will be accelerated."
Nvidia's share price was up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading.
Until recently, Nvidia got the biggest share of its revenue from sales of GPUs for rendering images in video games. But A.I. researchers started using those chips in 2012 for tasks such as machine learning, a trend that Nvidia exploited over the years by adding enhancements to its GPUs and many pieces of software to reduce labor for A.I. programmers.
Chip sales for data centers, where most A.I. training is accomplished, are now the company's biggest business. Revenue from that business grew 171 percent to $ 10.3 billion in the second period, Nvidia said.
Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the rush to add generative A.I. capability has become a fundamental imperative to corporate chiefs and boards of directors. Nvidia's only limitation at the moment, he said, is its struggle to supply enough chips -- a gap that may create opportunities for major chip companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and start-ups such as Groq.
Nvidia's roaring sales contrasted sharply with the fortunes of some of its chip industry peers, which have been hurt by soft demand for personal computers and data center servers used for general-purpose tasks. Intel said in late July that second-quarter revenue fell 15 percent, though the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Revenue at Advanced Micro Devices fell 18 percent in the same period.
Some analysts believe that spending on A.I.-specific hardware, such as Nvidia's chips and systems that use them, is drawing money away from spending on other data center infrastructure. IDC, a market research firm, estimates that cloud services will increase their spending on server systems for A.I. by 68 percent over the next five years.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
Demand is particularly heavy for the H100, a new GPU made by Nvidia for A.I. applications, which began shipping in September. Large and small companies have been scrambling to find supplies of the chips, which are fabricated in an advanced production process and require equally sophisticated packaging that combines GPUs with special memory chips.
Nvidia's ability to increase deliveries of the H100 is largely linked to actions by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which handles the packaging as well as fabricating the GPUs.
Industry executives expect the shortage of H100s to extend throughout 2024, a problem for A.I. start-ups and cloud services hoping to sell computing services that exploit the new GPUs.
Mr. Huang said the company was working diligently with its production partners to get more chips to market, including working with other companies to supplement TSMC's packaging capability. "Supply will substantially increase the rest of this year and next year," he said. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry.

UPS Workers Approve New 5-Year Contract, Averting Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The vote by members of the Teamsters union removes a potential threat to the economy.
Averting a strike that could have shaken the U.S. economy, the union representing more than 300,000 United Parcel Service employees announced Tuesday that its members had ratified a new labor agreement with the shipping giant.
The union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said that its UPS members approved the five-year contract with more than 86 percent support.
The Teamsters have said that the agreement includes wage gains of at least $ 7.50 an hour for current employees over its five-year term. It also raises the minimum pay for part-time workers to $ 21 an hour from under $ 17, and raises the top rate for full-time delivery drivers to about $ 49 on average.
Under the previous contract, which expired on Aug. 1, full-time drivers made an average of about $ 42 an hour after four years on the job.
In a statement, the union's president, Sean O'Brien, said the contract was the most lucrative ever at UPS and would serve as a model for other workers that the union is seeking to organize. "This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention," Mr. O'Brien said.
The Teamsters have made unionizing Amazon a top priority in recent years, and Mr. O'Brien said while running for the union's presidency in 2021 that doing so would first require big, concrete gains at other companies.
Despite the ratification, the new UPS contract will not take effect immediately. The union said in its statement that a group of workers in Florida voted down a supplement to the national contract that covers about 175 members -- one of 44 supplements that the union also negotiated.
The union said its negotiators would immediately meet with UPS to resolve the remaining issues so that those Florida members can vote again. The national contract will take effect once the supplement is approved.
UPS declined to comment beyond a brief news release noting the ratification vote and stating that the Florida supplement would be "finalized shortly."
The Teamsters had been aggressive in mobilizing members and ratcheting up pressure on the company in recent months, including picket-line practice and training sessions for strike captains. Mr. O'Brien has frequently referred to corporate leaders as a "white-collar crime syndicate" and argued that "this multibillion-dollar corporation has plenty to give American workers -- they just don't want to."
UPS moves about one-quarter of the tens of millions of packages shipped in the United States each day, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. Its adjusted net income rose more than 70 percent from 2019 to last year, reaching more than $ 11 billion.
The negotiations on a national contract began in April, and the union announced in mid-June that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.
The two sides resolved many key issues by early July, including eliminating a lower-paid category of full-time driver that had angered many UPS employees, and requiring air conditioning in new trucks to improve heat safety. But then negotiations broke down, with the Teamsters arguing that the company had not offered sufficient improvements in pay for part-time workers, who make up more than half of the union's UPS members.
Mr. O'Brien and the union spent the next few weeks condemning what they sometimes referred to as "part-time poverty" jobs, before the sides resumed negotiating in late July and quickly finalized a tentative deal.
UPS employees represented by the union began voting on the agreement in early August. While some part-time workers continued to argue that the wage gains should have been even larger and urged a "no" vote, the final margin suggested that most were satisfied with the deal.

Butterfly Vision: Seeing Colors That Others Can Only Imagine: [Science Desk]

Full text: Male zebra longwing butterfly vision sticks to a duller pallette, perhaps for mating reasons. The genes that explain this may help unlock how differences between sexes evolve.
Floating languorously through forests and jungles of the Americas, longwing butterflies have many secrets. The 30-odd species in this group include many mimics. The wing markings on some distantly related species of longwings are so similar they inspired one Victorian naturalist to theorize that harmless species could mimic deadly ones to avoid predators.
In the age of genomic sequencing, biologists have found other oddities in longwings. In a paper published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers report that female zebra longwings can see colors that males cannot, thanks to a gene on their sex chromosome. Understanding how it got there might shed light on how differences between sexes can evolve.
Like primates, butterflies have a handful of proteins that are sensitive to certain wavelengths of light that, working together, produce the ability to distinguish colors. Curious about the zebra longwing's vision, Adriana Briscoe, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the new paper, asked a student to check the species' genome for a well-known color vision gene. The gene, known as UVRh1, codes for a protein that is sensitive to ultraviolet light. To her surprise, it was nowhere to be found.
Digging deeper, and drawing on genomic data from additional zebra longwings, Dr. Briscoe and her colleagues discovered that UVRh1 was there, but only in females. With lab experiments, they confirmed that females could see markings males couldn't. They eventually pinpointed the gene in an unexpected place: the butterfly's tiny sex chromosome.
Sex chromosomes in butterflies are unstable, often shedding genes that are picked up by other chromosomes, or lost entirely, Dr. Briscoe said. That makes them a somewhat unusual place to keep something as important as a gene for color vision.
Then there are other butterflies whose males and females are known to have different color vision, perhaps having to do with females spotting males for mating. In those species, seeing some colors would be a waste of resources for the males. But for those insects, the differing vision seems related to how genes are regulated, not their placement on the sex chromosome. Somehow, in the zebra longwing, it took a different turn.
How did UVRh1 get to where it is today? Did it start out on the sex chromosome? Or did it move there from the shared chromosomes of the zebra longwing and then -- somehow -- get edited out of males, for whom maintaining more complex color vision might be more trouble than it's worth?
The question of what happened and when in the zebra longwing has deeper ramifications than simply understanding how the butterflies see, the researchers suggest. It touches on a riddle of evolutionary biology: The most successful female of a species and the most successful male may have very different, even contradictory, traits. What kind of genetic shenanigans are required to create this division?
If UVRh1 originated on the sex chromosome, then it deftly sidesteps a situation in which a trait that is optimal for females hampers the other sex, the researchers write.
Should that be the case, "it suggests that UV color vision started its life already limited to females, forgoing even the possibility of being a burden in males," said J.J. Emerson, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and also an author of the new paper. "This jump would be a neat trick if UVRh1 were harmful to males."
It should be possible to deduce what happened in zebra longwings with further research, Dr. Briscoe said. There are some longwing species whose genomes have yet to be adequately studied. One in particular, the Aoede longwing, which lives in remote forests in the Amazon Basin, promises a potential answer.
If it too has females that see more than males, then it suggests that UVRh1 indeed started out on the sex chromosome, Dr. Briscoe said.
That would be another data point in a growing body of work examining the differences between sexes in butterflies.
"In the old days, nobody would study the difference between the sexes" in butterflies, Dr. Briscoe said. "There was no attempt to figure out if they were doing anything differently."
She suspects that evolution may have wrought other intriguing differences in longwings that scientists are just at the beginning of uncovering.

Huge I.P.O. Is Anticipated For Chip Firm: [Correction]

Full text: The News
Arm, the chip design company owned by SoftBank, filed for an initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange on Monday, in what is expected to be one of the largest I.P.O.s in recent years.
The filing comes 18 months after Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker, abandoned its offer to buy Arm for $ 40 billion. The Federal Trade Commission had sued to stop the deal.
Arm did not list a prospective share price in its filing on Monday.
The company reported $ 2.68 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ended in March, just below its $ 2.70 billion the year before. Last quarter, Arm had net income of 10 cents per share, down from 22 cents the previous year.
Why It Matters
The move will provide Arm's parent company, SoftBank, with more capital to further invest in start-ups. In a recent meeting with investors and analysts, SoftBank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, said the company was ready to shift to "offense" in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the filing, Arm said more than 30 billion Arm-based chips were shipped last fiscal year. SoftBank will remain Arm's controlling shareholder.
Background
Arm, a 33-year-old company, develops and licenses blueprints for microprocessors that other companies turn into chips. Its energy-efficient technology played a major role in fueling the mobile phone boom, including every iPhone that Apple has sold since 2007.
But Arm technology is also found in myriad other products, including home appliances, cars and industrial equipment. The company estimates that more than 250 billion Arm-based chips had been sold.
Arm was a public company until 2016, when SoftBank bought it for $ 32 billion. Nvidia made its bid for the company in September 2020, but ran into vocal opposition from regulators and some major chip companies.
SoftBank has taken huge losses since that failed acquisition, posting a $ 3.3 billion loss in this year's first quarter. The Vision Fund, which is SoftBank's technology investment arm, noted a net loss of $ 3.3 billion but an investment gain of $ 1.1 billion in the second quarter, after a loss of $ 23.1 billion a year earlier.
What's Next
The I.P.O. filing means Arm can begin to gauge investor interest, which will be critical to the share sale. The company will still need to say how much it plans to raise in the offering, and what valuation it is seeking, something it will do closer to the sale.
Rene Haas, who has been Arm's chief executive since February 2022, has pushed the company to move into more lucrative areas, including data center servers operated by companies like Amazon. How well that effort is faring, as well as the names of any high-profile investors and potential changes to Arm's business model to bring in more revenue, is likely to be a key topic for investors studying its offering prospectus.

In Ecuador, an Establishment Leftist and a Newcomer Businessman Will Face Off: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Luisa González and Daniel Noboa were the top candidates to emerge from Sunday's election in a country where declining security has been the leading issue for most voters.
An establishment leftist and a newcomer businessman captured the top two spots in Ecuador's presidential election on Sunday in a campaign cycle that has centered on voters' frustration with the country's soaring gang and drug cartel violence.
Luisa González, who was backed by a former socialist president, and the political outsider Daniel Noboa received the highest percentage of ballots with 84 percent of the vote counted. They will compete in a runoff election on Oct. 15.
The economy and security are likely to be the leading issues going into the runoff, as local prison and street gangs, along with foreign drug mafias, have unleashed a wave of violence unlike anything in the country's recent history, sending homicide rates to record levels and hurting the vital tourism industry.
Concerns over the declining security were amplified earlier this month when the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated on the campaign trail.
Ms. González led the election, garnering 33 percent of the vote, with 84 percent counted, followed by Mr. Noboa, the unexpected second-place winner with 24 percent. Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Noboa was polling in single digits.
Ecuador also voted on Sunday to halt drilling in one of the most biodiverse corners of the Amazon in a victory for a decade-long fight by environmental activists to get the binding referendum in front of voters.
Sunday's first-round vote followed President Guillermo Lasso's call for snap elections in May amid impeachment proceedings against him over accusations of embezzlement, as well as rising voter dissatisfaction over the nation's security crisis.
Ecuador, a country of 18 million, was once a tranquil haven compared with its neighbor Colombia, which for decades was ravaged by violence by armed guerrilla and paramilitary groups and drug cartels. As that changed in the past few years after Colombia forged a peace deal, the narco-trafficking industry grew increasingly powerful in Ecuador.
Amid news reports regularly featuring beheadings, car bombs, police assassinations, young men hanging from bridges and children gunned down outside their homes and schools, Ecuadoreans are hoping for new leadership that can restore the peaceful existence they once took for granted.
The González-Noboa matchup means that "there's still a strong, loyal base for Correísmo that's enough to get González into the runoff," said Risa Grais-Targow, the Latin America director for Eurasia Group, referring to the leftist movement of former President Rafael Correa, who governed from 2007 to 2017.
But, she said, "there's a large share of the population that really wants something completely different -- they want a new face."
The surprise of the night was the second-place victory for Mr. Noboa, who was recently polling toward the bottom of the pool of eight candidates.
"The youth opted for the Daniel Noboa option," said Mr. Noboa in a news conference Sunday night. "It would not be the first time that a new proposal would turn around the electoral establishment," he added, referring to himself.
The 35-year-old comes from one of the richest families in Latin America, known to most Ecuadoreans for its banana empire. His father ran for president five times, unsuccessfully, but the younger Noboa's political career goes back only to 2021, when he was elected to Ecuador's Congress.
"He has a voting base that is familiar with the Noboa brand, with the Noboa name, and that now has been very successfully energized, refreshed with a new face," said Caroline Ávila, an Ecuadorean political analyst. "He captures the attention of young people, the main mass of undecided voters. They are the ones who are putting him in the second round."
Mr. Noboa's campaign seemed to take off only a week ago, when he impressed many Ecuadoreans with his debate performance.
"He stands out in the debate," Ms. Ávila said. "He speaks well, he speaks fluently, without complicating himself too much, without fighting. And it has generated a lot of interest in these post-debate weeks."
As a legislator and member of the National Democratic Action Movement, Mr. Noboa supported bills to attract international investment and cut taxes, said Grace Jaramillo, an Ecuadorean professor of political science at the University of British Columbia.
His policy proposals include pledges to create jobs, lower taxes, lower electricity bills and enter into more international free trade agreements.
"It's a big surprise, especially in the fact that the debate did have an effect," said Arturo Moscoso, a Quito-based political scientist. But he added, "For many Ecuadoreans he is an unknown."
Mr. Noboa positioned himself as "the employment president," even including an employment request form on his website, among other broad commitments to security and the economy. As a businessman and U.S. citizen who grew up in the United States, he is likely to favor American market-friendly interests, said Ms. Grais-Targow.
While analysts predicted security to be the main issue in the election following the assassination, Mr. Noboa's success shows that in a country where just 34 percent of Ecuadoreans have adequate employment, according to government data, the economy is still top of mind.
One voter, Carlos Andrés Eras, 31, said he supported Mr. Noboa because he saw him as a well-prepared politician with clear proposals.
"It is not improvised; he has been putting together his political project little by little," said Mr. Eras, who owns a jewelry store in Guayaquil. "He concentrated on giving his points and answered what was raised in the question without attacking anyone."
Mr. Noboa came in just behind the leftist establishment candidate, Ms. González.
Backed by the powerful party of Mr. Correa, the former president, Ms. González, 45, has appealed to voter nostalgia for the economic and security situation under the Correa administration, when homicide rates were low and a commodities boom helped lift millions out of poverty.
"It is the first time in the history of Ecuador that a woman has obtained such a high percentage in the first round," said Ms. González in her postelection speech. "We are going to have that homeland again with hope, with dignity, with security."
Germán Montoya, a voter and the owner of a plastic company in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, said extortion payments demanded by gangs were hurting his business and had pushed him to vote for Ms. González.
"'Mr. Montoya, I can't go there, here, because they charge me a toll,"' he said his employees tell him. The trucks are charged $ 50 to make deliveries in different parts of Guayaquil, Mr. Montoya, 37, said.
Jordy Gonzales, a 23-year-old construction worker, felt similarly. Mr. Correa's party, he said, "did things right, and we are going to see if this time, if God allows it, it will be like before."
If Ms. González wins the election in October, it will show the staying power of Mr. Correa as a dominant political force in Ecuador despite being out of power for six years.
He has lived in Belgium since he left office, fleeing an eight-year prison sentence for campaign-finance violations. But experts predict that in the event of a González victory, he would be likely to return to the country and try to seek office again before the next president's tenure expires in May 2025.
Beyond Sunday's presidential election, Ecuadoreans also voted to end drilling in the Amazon, dealing a major blow to the government, which had been lobbying to continue oil operations.
The section of jungle on the ballot, part of Yasuní National Park, is one of the most ecologically rich places on Earth and home to Indigenous people who want no contact with outsiders.
The state oil company, Petroecuador, will have roughly a year and a half to wind up its operations in the area, though experts say shutting down the oil field could take six to 10 years.
According to Andrés Martínez Moscoso, a law professor at the San Francisco de Quito University, neither the president, Congress nor a new referendum can undo Sunday's results.
The decision is "a very clear signal, especially to the international community, of the population's desire to turn this extractive economy around," said Ms. Ávila. It would also force future governments to think of "other ways of generating income that are not exclusively from oil."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The most visible winner of the artificial intelligence boom achieved its dominance by becoming a one-stop shop for A.I. development, from chips to software to other services.
Naveen Rao, a neuroscientist turned tech entrepreneur, once tried to compete with Nvidia, the world's leading maker of chips tailored for artificial intelligence.
At a start-up that the semiconductor giant Intel later bought, Mr. Rao worked on chips intended to replace Nvidia's graphics processing units, which are components adapted for A.I. tasks like machine learning. But while Intel moved slowly, Nvidia swiftly upgraded its products with new A.I. features that countered what he was developing, Mr. Rao said.
After leaving Intel and leading a software start-up, MosaicML, Mr. Rao used Nvidia's chips and evaluated them against those from rivals. He found that Nvidia had differentiated itself beyond the chips by creating a large community of A.I. programmers who consistently invent using the company's technology.
"Everybody builds on Nvidia first," Mr. Rao said. "If you come out with a new piece of hardware, you're racing to catch up."
Over more than 10 years, Nvidia has built a nearly impregnable lead in producing chips that can perform complex A.I. tasks like image, facial and speech recognition, as well as generating text for chatbots like ChatGPT. The onetime industry upstart achieved that dominance by recognizing the A.I. trend early, tailoring its chips to those tasks and then developing key pieces of software that aid in A.I. development.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, has since kept raising the bar. To maintain its leading position, his company has also offered customers access to specialized computers, computing services and other tools of their emerging trade. That has turned Nvidia, for all intents and purposes, into a one-stop shop for A.I. development.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
In May, the company's status as the most visible winner of the A.I. revolution became clear when it projected a 64 percent leap in quarterly revenue, far more than Wall Street had expected. On Wednesday, Nvidia -- which has surged past $ 1 trillion in market capitalization to become the world's most valuable chip maker -- is expected to confirm those record results and provide more signals about booming A.I. demand.
"Customers will wait 18 months to buy an Nvidia system rather than buy an available, off-the-shelf chip from either a start-up or another competitor," said Daniel Newman, an analyst at Futurum Group. "It's incredible."
Mr. Huang, 60, who is known for a trademark black leather jacket, talked up A.I. for years before becoming one of the movement's best-known faces. He has publicly said computing is going through its biggest shift since IBM defined how most systems and software operate 60 years ago. Now, he said, GPUs and other special-purpose chips are replacing standard microprocessors, and A.I. chatbots are replacing complex software coding.
"The thing that we understood is that this is a reinvention of how computing is done," Mr. Huang said in an interview. "And we built everything from the ground up, from the processor all the way up to the end."
Mr. Huang helped start Nvidia in 1993 to make chips that render images in video games. While standard microprocessors excel at performing complex calculations sequentially, the company's GPUs do many simple tasks at once.
In 2006, Mr. Huang took that further. He announced software technology called CUDA, which helped program the GPUs for new tasks, turning them from single-purpose chips to more general-purpose ones that could take on other jobs in fields like physics and chemical simulations.
A big breakthrough came in 2012 when researchers used GPUs to achieve humanlike accuracy in tasks such as recognizing a cat in an image -- a precursor to recent developments like generating images from text prompts.
Nvidia responded by turning "every aspect of our company to advance this new field," Mr. Jensen recently said in a commencement speech at National Taiwan University.
The effort, which the company estimated has cost more than $ 30 billion over a decade, made Nvidia more than a component supplier. Besides collaborating with leading scientists and start-ups, the company built a team that directly participates in A.I. activities like creating and training language models.
Advance warning about what A.I. practitioners need led Nvidia to develop many layers of key software beyond CUDA. Those included hundreds of prebuilt pieces of code, called libraries, that save labor for programmers.
In hardware, Nvidia gained a reputation for consistently delivering faster chips every couple of years. In 2017, it started tweaking GPUs to handle specific A.I. calculations.
That same year, Nvidia, which typically sold chips or circuit boards for other companies' systems, also began selling complete computers to carry out A.I. tasks more efficiently. Some of its systems are now the size of supercomputers, which it assembles and operates using proprietary networking technology and thousands of GPUs. Such hardware may run weeks to train the latest A.I. models.
"This type of computing doesn't allow for you to just build a chip and customers use it," Mr. Huang said in the interview. "You've got to build the whole data center."
Last September, Nvidia announced the production of new chips named H100, which it enhanced to handle so-called transformer operations. Such calculations turned out to be the foundation for services like ChatGPT, which have prompted what Mr. Huang calls the "iPhone moment" of generative A.I.
To further extend its influence, Nvidia has also recently forged partnerships with big tech companies and invested in high-profile A.I. start-ups that use its chips. One was Inflection AI, which in June announced $ 1.3 billion in funding from Nvidia and others. The money was used to help finance the purchase of 22,000 H100 chips.
Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection's chief executive, said that there was no obligation to use Nvidia's products but that competitors offered no viable alternative. "None of them come close," he said.
Nvidia has also directed cash and scarce H100s lately to upstart cloud services, such as CoreWeave, that allow companies to rent time on computers rather than buying their own. CoreWeave, which will operate Inflection's hardware and owns more than 45,000 Nvidia chips, raised $ 2.3 billion in debt this month to help buy more.
Given the demand for its chips, Nvidia must decide who gets how many of them. That power makes some tech executives uneasy.
"It's really important that hardware doesn't become a bottleneck for A.I. or gatekeeper for A.I.," said Clément Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face, an online repository for language models that collaborates with Nvidia and its competitors.
Some rivals said it was tough to compete with a company that sold computers, software, cloud services and trained A.I. models, as well as processors.
"Unlike any other chip company, they have been willing to openly compete with their customers," said Andrew Feldman, chief executive of Cerebras, a start-up that develops A.I. chips.
But few customers are complaining, at least publicly. Even Google, which began creating competing A.I. chips more than a decade ago, relies on Nvidia's GPUs for some of its work.
Demand for Google's own chips is "tremendous," said Amin Vahdat, a Google vice president and general manager of compute infrastructure. But, he added, "we work really closely with Nvidia."
Nvidia doesn't discuss prices or chip allocation policies, but industry executives and analysts said each H100 costs $ 15,000 to more than $ 40,000, depending on packaging and other factors -- roughly two to three times more than the predecessor A100 chip.
Pricing "is one place where Nvidia has left a lot of room for other folks to compete," said David Brown, a vice president at Amazon's cloud unit, arguing that its own A.I. chips are a bargain compared with the Nvidia chips it also uses.
Mr. Huang said his chips' greater performance saved customers money. "If you can reduce the time of training to half on a $ 5 billion data center, the savings is more than the cost of all of the chips," he said. "We are the lowest-cost solution in the world."
He has also started promoting a new product, Grace Hopper, which combines GPUs with internally developed microprocessors, countering chips that rivals say use much less energy for running A.I. services.
Still, more competition seems inevitable. One of the most promising entrants in the race is a GPU sold by Advanced Micro Devices, said Mr. Rao, whose start-up was recently purchased by the data and A.I. company DataBricks.
"No matter how anybody wants to say it's all done, it's not all done," Lisa Su, AMD's chief executive, said.

Horrifying Options As Summer Fades: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the big screen, under the stars or in your living room, there are plenty of frights to catch up with before fall's serious season arrives.
No matter if you're a horror die-hard or an occasional toe-dipper, here's an end-of-summer guide to slashers, thrillers, creature features, kid comedies and other scary movies.
Grab a Seat
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The buzzy new horror movie in theaters is "Talk to Me," an Australian demon-possession film by the brothers Danny and Michael Philippou. Despite some messy storytelling -- does anybody work at the local hospital? -- it's a propulsive movie about trauma, parenthood and the afterlife that manages to be both harrowing and tender.
New York's repertory theaters are always offering opportunities to discover or revisit horror's past. The Alamo Drafthouse has two very different creepy films on tap: "Psycho," the groundbreaking and still terrifying 1960 proto-slasher (Aug. 18, 20 and 22 at the exhibitor's Staten Island location), and "Killer Workout" (Aug. 22, Brooklyn), a 1987 schlocky slasher about an aerobics studio under siege from a maniac.
Take a time machine to grindhouse-era sleaze at the Nighthawk in Williamsburg, which is showing "The Honeymoon Killers" (Aug. 23), a 1970 thriller based on the lives of Martha Beck and Ray Fernandez, otherwise known as the Lonely Hearts Killers.
Laptop, schmaptop: See it big in "See It Big," a series dedicated to 70-millimeter films now at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. The disaster film is a horror-adjacent genre that warms my fear-seeking heart, so I'd go with a progenitor: "Airport," (Aug. 25-26), the 1970 camp-as-heck drama with a starry cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin and Jacqueline Bisset.
Brooklyn's Spectacle Theater is known for its out-in-left-field repertory programming. Its Dark Side of Summer series hits a Gen X home run with "Cutting Class" (Aug. 19 and 24), a wacky 1989 high school slasher-comedy starring a baby-faced Brad Pitt and a sourpussed Roddy McDowall.
"What better way to cool down in the sweltering August heat than by watching two chilling black-and-white gay serial killer flicks?" That's how Anthology Film Archives bills its experimental double feature on Aug. 18, part of the Narrow Rooms series of subversive queer cinema. On tap are "Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men" (1989), a wordless cinematic adaptation of a theater piece about the serial killer Dennis Nilsen, and "Pig" (1998), a short film about a ritual murder.
Make a Night of It
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If it's too hot to open the front door, I say turn the lights out, crank up the AC and stream some of the year's most popular horror movies, including "Scream VI" (Paramount+), "M3gan" (Amazon Prime Video), "Evil Dead Rise" (Max), "Infinity Pool" (Hulu) and "Knock at the Cabin" (Peacock).
For new international horror, head to Netflix. Two recent standouts include "The Strays," a dark drama about secret traumas that haunt a family in suburban England, and "Troll," a teen-friendly, folk-horror creature feature about a towering moss-covered monster that ravages Norway.
Tubi, the ad-supported streaming service, has a terrific roster of classic horror, including "Ringu" (1998) and "Last House on the Left" (1972). But for a Friday night at home with friends and pasta -- manicotti, to be exact -- you can't get funnier than the new adults-only gross-out animated comedy "Pastacolypse," about a chef named Alfredo Manicotti who turns into a maniacal noodle monster out to corrupt a gluten-free world.
Two of the year's most experimental and renegade horror movies are streaming, too. "Skinamarink," now on Hulu, is a starkly minimalist and macabre mood piece about children and the night terror they encounter inside their home. "The Outwaters," on Screambox, is a brutal and gory film -- an experience, really -- about an entity that assaults a group of friends in the Mojave Desert. Consider yourself warned.
Get Out
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A sweeping view of Times Square is a perk of the Rooftop Cinema Club, which shows films atop the Embassy Suites Hotel on West 37th Street in Manhattan. Horror movies on the calendar include the comedy "Scary Movie" (Aug. 20) slasher classic and the family-friendly comedy "The Addams Family" (Sept. 1). But my must-see pick is "Jennifer's Body" (Sept. 3), a deeply unsettling feminist fable from 2009 about the aftermath of a woman's traumatic sexual assault.
Some of my favorite childhood memories are watching scary (but not too scary) movies by moonlight. The 2022 animated sci-fi adventure "Strange World" (Aug. 26) is showing for free at Police Officer Nicholas Demutiis Park in Queens as part of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation's Movies Under the Stars series.
Take a Ride
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Creepy costumes and a hunger for nostalgia are encouraged at the Rosendale Theater in Rosendale, N.Y., an Ulster County cinema about a two-hour drive from New York City. The theater has a robust calendar of genre movies all year, but I'm a fan of its Saturday Creature Features series. The theater is showing a gem, "Them!" (Aug. 19), the gonzo 1954 B-movie about larger-than-life monster ants who tear up Los Angeles.
Over Labor Day weekend, the Mahoning Drive-in in Lehighton, Pa., about a 90-minute drive from New York, is hosting "Camp Blood," a 35-millimeter camping-themed horror movie extravaganza. The schedule is heavy on slashers, including "The Burning," a 1981 revenge slice-and-dicer with Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter (to be followed by an actual campfire); "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter," the of-course-not-final film in the slasher franchise, from 1984; and "Sleepaway Camp," the queer but controversial vengeance fantasy that turns 40 this year.
The weekend includes raffles, live music and games, including an eyeball toss and the Crystal Lake Morgue Body Bag Race. I recommend visiting hungry: The concessions, including vegan options and my favorite, pierogies, are affordable and pigout-worthy.

Full text: Sports have always been my ticket to travel: to a surf spot above the Arctic Circle, to a volcano in Mexico and to soccer games in New Zealand.
While growing up in a small town on Louisiana's Cajun prairie in the 1950s and '60s, I longed to see the world. I read the National Geographic magazines that my brother received with a gift subscription every Christmas. We had Beatles albums, of course, but we also played a disc from National Geographic that featured the greatest hits of the humpback whale.
In my fourth-grade geography class, I became enamored with exotic-sounding places such as Reykjavik, Lapland and the Zuider Zee. And I wanted to know what the hell tapioca pudding was.
I still haven't visited any of those places, but I have tasted tapioca pudding. And, upon arriving in New Zealand this month to cover part of the Women's World Cup, I've now reported from 56 countries in my career as a sports reporter, the last 30 years of which have been at The New York Times.
My parents wanted me to be a doctor. I wanted to travel. Sportswriting seemed like the perfect passport.
I've been fortunate enough to cover 13 Olympic Games, eight men's World Cups and six Women's World Cups. Pursuit of soccer took me on a 15-hour boat trip up the Amazon and a 27-hour train ride from Moscow to the Urals. Along the way, I crossed the Berlin Wall, stood on the Great Wall of China, joined elite runners atop a 13,000-foot volcano in Mexico and descended a mile underground into a South African mine.
Who wouldn't love being paid to cover international sporting events in London, Paris and Rome? But, perhaps given the duck-and-cover era of my youth, I've often been drawn more eagerly to places of Cold War vintage or international disaster, places isolated and once or still forbidden. And one place, East Germany, that no longer exists.
I've visited Hiroshima and written about a trip to Chernobyl during the 2012 European soccer championships that took place two hours south, in Kyiv. In 2010, I was given a tour of Nelson Mandela's former jail cell on Robben Island off Cape Town. My guide was a onetime inmate who directed the infamous prison's soccer league and wrote an entire math textbook on a roll of toilet paper.
In 2015, I ran a marathon in North Korea. My tour group was accompanied by a minder from the sports ministry. He knew of Dennis Rodman, a favorite of the authoritarian leader and basketball fan Kim Jong Un, but had never heard of LeBron James.
In 2018, while the opening match of the men's World Cup took place in Moscow, I watched from a military bunker on the Ukrainian border. The game played on one of three televisions in the bunker, while low-level fighting between the Ukrainian military and Russian separatists played on the other two.
I've made a dozen reporting trips to Africa, where you can be guaranteed of seeing something you have never seen before. In Angola, a man asked if I would carry $ 10,000 through customs for him (I declined). In Ethiopia, I saw rows of table soccer games evenly spread out along an empty stretch of highway, no one within miles to play these ghostly amusements.
After growing up with air-conditioning during Louisiana winters, I've been attracted to stories in some of the world's coldest climates -- the surf spot above the Arctic Circle in Norway, the soccer tournament among Indigenous youth in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. Last year, I reported from Longyearbyen, Norway, the world's northernmost town, where climate change is happening faster than any other place on the planet.
Winter, too, in the Southern Hemisphere is what attracted me, in part, to New Zealand as a reprieve from the broiling summer at home in Philadelphia, where I live. Queenstown, on the South Island, is a winter sports hub. In between soccer reporting, I took a couple of bracing runs along Lake Wakatipu as the temperature hovered around freezing. And I booked a helicopter ride to Tyndall Glacier in the Southern Alps, where it was 7 degrees Fahrenheit in glorious sunshine but comfortably windless above 6,000 feet.
During my trip to the glacier, it became apparent to me that I was surrounded by change:
Climate change in Queenstown, where layers of glacier snow are striped, like gritty icing inside a birthday cake, with ash that carried across the Tasman Sea from the 2019-20 Australian bush fires.
Change in women's soccer, where all of the previous World Cup champions were eliminated by the quarterfinals and a first-time winner, either England or Spain, will be crowned on Sunday.
And career change, now that The Times is disbanding its Sports desk and moving members of our team to other departments.
I'm not sure if I'll ever return to this part of the world. But Reykjavik remains high on my fourth-grade bucket list.

It's a Surprisingly Speedy Shift: [SpecialSections]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Full text: "Soft girl summer," one of the latest crazes on social media, represents a gentle way of life that prioritizes self-care and stepping off the hamster wheel. Any person, regardless of gender identity, can have a soft girl summer day. These tips and picks will help you live better. ELISSA SANCI
Rise slowly. Don't start your day with a blaring cellphone alarm. Instead, try a sunrise alarm clock that gradually brightens the room. The Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light uses red-tinted light to simulate the natural colors of dawn.
Slip into something comfortable. Comb through your closet and don your favorite summer dress, your loosest linen pants or whatever you find to be most comfortable.
Clear your head. Before embarking on a day dedicated to living in the moment, take some time to jot down your thoughts. Whether you're free writing or following specific prompts, writing in a journal can be a great way to touch base with yourself.
Hit the farmers market. Spend your idle summer morning wandering through your local farmers market and foraging for your favorites. Don't forget your reusable bags.
Tap into your creative side. You don't need to be a professional artist to find artistic endeavors therapeutic. Watercolor is an especially forgiving medium for beginner painters.
Sip and snack with friends. Gather your friends for evening cocktails, charcuterie and camaraderie. Whether you're sipping on something boozy or a tasty nonalcoholic spritz, you'll want to use an insulated wine tumbler to keep your beverage cool.
Unwind with a book in the bath. Celebrate the end of a peaceful day with a blissful bubble bath and a good story. As you fill the tub, pour a generous amount of Dr. Teal's Balance & Calm Foaming Bath, which produces lush bubbles. Use a waterproof Kindle Paperwhite to survive an accidental drop in the tub.
Tuck in for the night. We can't think of a better way to end a soft summer day than slipping under a weighted blanket and drifting off to dreamland.

YouTube Ads Raise Alarm On Kids' Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: YouTube's advertising practices on kids' channels could have resulted in companies tracking children across the web, a report said.
This year, BMO, a Canadian bank, was looking for Canadian adults to apply for a credit card. So the bank's advertising agency ran a YouTube campaign using an ad-targeting system from Google that employs artificial intelligence to pinpoint ideal customers.
But Google, which owns YouTube, also showed the ad to a viewer in the United States on a Barbie-themed children's video on the "Kids Diana Show," a YouTube channel for preschoolers whose videos have been watched more than 94 billion times.
When that viewer clicked on the ad, it led to BMO's website, which tagged the user's browser with tracking software from Google, Meta, Microsoft and other companies, according to new research from Adalytics, which analyzes ad campaigns for brands.
As a result, leading tech companies could have tracked children across the internet, raising concerns about whether they were undercutting a federal privacy law, the report said. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, requires children's online services to obtain parental consent before collecting personal data from users under age 13 for purposes like ad targeting.
The report's findings raise new concerns about YouTube's advertising on children's content. In 2019, YouTube and Google agreed to pay a record $ 170 million fine to settle accusations from the Federal Trade Commission and the State of New York that the company had illegally collected personal information from children watching kids' channels. Regulators said the company had profited from using children's data to target them with ads.
YouTube then said it would limit the collection of viewers' data and stop serving personalized ads on children's videos.
On Thursday, two United States senators sent a letter to the F.T.C., urging it to investigate whether Google and YouTube had violated COPPA, citing Adalytics and reporting by The New York Times. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said they were concerned that the company may have tracked children and served them targeted ads without parental consent, facilitating "the vast collection and distribution" of children's data.
"This behavior by YouTube and Google is estimated to have impacted hundreds of thousands, to potentially millions, of children across the United States," the senators wrote.
Adalytics identified more than 300 brands' ads for adult products, like cars, on nearly 100 YouTube videos designated as "made for kids" that were shown to a user who was not signed in, and that linked to advertisers' websites. It also found several YouTube ads with violent content, including explosions, sniper rifles and car accidents, on children's channels.
An analysis by The Times this month found that when a viewer who was not signed into YouTube clicked the ads on some of the children's channels on the site, they were taken to brand websites that placed trackers -- bits of code used for purposes like security, ad tracking or user profiling -- from Amazon, Meta's Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others -- on users' browsers.
As with children's television, it is legal, and commonplace, to run ads, including for adult consumer products like cars or credit cards, on children's videos. There is no evidence that Google and YouTube violated their 2019 agreement with the F.T.C.
The Times shared some of Adalytics' research with Google ahead of its publication. Michael Aciman, a Google spokesman, called the report's findings "deeply flawed and misleading." Google has also challenged a previous Adalytics report on the company's ad practices, first reported on by The Wall Street Journal.
Google told The Times it was useful to run ads for adults on children's videos because parents who were watching could become customers. It also noted that running violent ads on children's videos violated company policy and that YouTube had "changed the classification" of the violent ads cited by Adalytics to prevent them from running on kids' content "moving forward."
Google said that it did not run personalized ads on children's videos and that its ad practices fully complied with COPPA. When ads appear on children's videos, the company said, they are based on webpage content, not targeted to user profiles. Google said that it did not notify advertisers or tracking services whether a viewer coming from YouTube had watched a children's video -- only that the user had watched YouTube and clicked on the ad.
The company added that it did not have the ability to control data collection on a brand's website after a YouTube viewer clicked on an ad. Such data-gathering, Google said, could happen when clicking on an ad on any website.
Even so, ad industry veterans said they had found it difficult to prevent their clients' YouTube ads from appearing on children's videos, according to recent Times interviews with 10 senior employees at ad agencies and related companies. And they argued that YouTube's ad placement had put prominent consumer brands at risk of compromising children's privacy.
"I'm incredibly concerned about it," said Arielle Garcia, the chief privacy officer of UM Worldwide, the ad agency that ran the BMO campaign.
Ms. Garcia said she was speaking generally and could not comment specifically on the BMO campaign. "It should not be this difficult to make sure that children's data isn't inappropriately collected and used," she said.
Google said it gave brands a one-click option to exclude their ads from appearing on YouTube videos made for children.
The BMO campaign had targeted the ads using Performance Max, a specialized Google A.I. tool that does not tell companies the specific videos on which their ads ran. Google said that the ads had not initially excluded children's videos, and that the company recently helped the campaign update its settings.
In August, an ad for a different BMO credit card popped up on a video on the Moolt Kids Toons Happy Bear channel, which has more than 600 million views on its cartoon videos. Google said the second ad campaign did not appear to have excluded children's videos.
Jeff Roman, a spokesman for BMO, said "BMO does not seek to nor does it knowingly target minors with its online advertising and takes steps to prevent its ads from being served to minors."
Several industry veterans reported problems with more conventional Google ad services. They described how they had received reports of their ads running on children's videos, made long lists to exclude those videos, only to later see their ads run on other kids' videos.
"It's a constant game of Whac-a-Mole," said Lou Paskalis, the former head of global media for Bank of America, who now runs a marketing consulting firm.
Adalytics also said that Google had set persistent cookies -- the types of files that could track the ads a user clicks on and the websites they visit -- on YouTube children's videos.
The Times observed persistent Google cookies on children's videos, including an advertising cookie called IDE. When a viewer clicked on an ad, the same cookie also appeared on the ad page they landed on.
Google said it used such cookies on children's videos only for business purposes permitted under COPPA, such as fraud detection or measuring how many times a viewer sees an ad. Google said the cookie contents "were encrypted and not readable by third parties."
"Under COPPA, the presence of cookies is permissible for internal operations including fraud detection," said Paul Lekas, head of global public policy at the SIIA, a software industry group whose members include Google and BMO, "so long as cookies and other persistent identifiers are not used to contact an individual, amass a profile or engage in behavioral advertising."
The Times found an ad for Kohl's clothing that ran on "Wheels on the Bus," a nursery rhyme video that has been viewed 2.4 billion times. A viewer who clicked on the ad was taken to a Kohl's web page containing more than 300 tracking requests from about 80 third-party services. These included a cross-site tracking code from Meta that could enable it to follow viewers of children's videos across the web.
Kohl's did not respond to several requests for comment.
A Microsoft spokesman said: "Our commitment to privacy shapes the way we build all our products and services. We are getting more information so that we can conduct any further investigation needed." Amazon said it prohibited advertisers from collecting children's data with its tools. Meta declined to comment.
Children's privacy experts said they were concerned that the setup of Google's interlocking ecosystem -- including the most popular internet browser, video platform and largest digital ad business -- had facilitated the online tracking of children by tech giants, advertisers and data brokers.
"They have created a conveyor belt that is scooping up the data of children," said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy.

Oil Drilling Ban in Ecuador Is Up for a Vote: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Voters decide on Sunday whether the country will ban oil operations in a section of the Amazon that's one of the most biodiverse places on Earth.
Should Ecuador continue drilling in one of the most biodiverse corners of the Amazon or should it keep the oil underground? On Sunday, its people will decide in a binding referendum that landed on the ballot after a decade-long fight by young activists.
As the world faces twin ecological crises of climate change and ecosystem collapse, the vote will determine what one country's citizens are willing to give up to protect the planet.
The section of jungle on the ballot Sunday, part of Yasuní National Park, is one of the most ecologically rich places on Earth and home to Indigenous people who want no contact with outsiders. The vote comes as the planet swelters under record-breaking heat and scientists warn that the Amazon rainforest is dangerously close to a tipping point that could turn it into grasslands.
But oil is Ecuador's most important export and the government is campaigning for drilling to continue. According to official estimates, the country stands to lose $ 1.2 billion in revenue a year if the oil is left underground.
"It's historic," said Pedro Bermeo, one of the founding members of Yasunidos, the group behind the referendum. "We're democratizing environmental politics."
Adding to the tension in Ecuador is a worsening political and security crisis. The Sunday election was called in May after President Guillermo Lasso, facing impeachment proceedings, invoked his right to dissolve Congress. Then, last week, one of the presidential candidates, Fernando Villavicencio, was assassinated.
It's unclear how the political turbulence will affect the referendum, but a recent survey by Comunicaliza, a polling firm based in Quito, the capital, suggested that 35 percent of voters want to stop the drilling, 10 percentage points more than those backing oil. Many said they were still undecided.
The vote is the culmination of a groundbreaking proposal suggested almost two decades ago when Rafael Correa, who was president of Ecuador at the time, tried to persuade wealthy nations to pay his country to keep the same oil field in Yasuní untouched. He asked for $ 3.6 billion, or half of the estimated value of the oil reserves.
Mr. Correa spent six years in a campaign to advance the proposal but never managed to persuade wealthy nations to pay. Many young Ecuadoreans, though, were persuaded. When Mr. Correa announced that the proposal had failed and that drilling would begin, many started protesting.
It was during those days that Antonella Calle, 19 at the time, along with other young people and environmentalists, decided to keep fighting as part of a new organization called Yasunidos.
Mr. Correa scoffed at the opposition to drilling. "Gather the signatures and let's go to a referendum and we will win again," he said.
Yasunidos recruited around 1,400 volunteers to walk the streets and knock on doors across the country. In a six-month whirlwind, they collected more than 757,000 signatures, almost 200,000 more than required to trigger a referendum.
Polls from around that time suggested that more than 90 percent of Ecuadoreans would have voted to keep the oil underground. But the Correa administration created a task force to verify signatures and voided more than half of them. Even Ms. Calle and Mr. Bermeo's signatures were deemed invalid.
"It was a very tough blow," Ms. Calle said. "They were calling us liars."
So, Yasunidos started a decade-long legal struggle to get the referendum in front of voters. Finally, in May, the Supreme Court ordered the government to include the measure in the upcoming election.
The referendum also builds on work by Indigenous groups in Ecuador. In 2019, for example, after a court battle, a Waorani Indigenous community managed to block oil development on its land.
"Mother Earth isn't waiting for us to save her," said Nemonte Nenquimo, a leader who pushed that effort. "Mother Earth is waiting for us to respect her. If we don't respect her, Mother Earth herself will swallow humanity."
If Yasunidos wins, the state oil company, Petroecuador, will have roughly a year and a half to wind up its operations in the area, known as the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini Oil Field. According to Andrés Martínez Moscoso, a law professor at the San Francisco de Quito University, neither the president, Congress nor a new referendum could undo Sunday's results.
But by now, Petroecuador has invested more than $ 2 billion to extract oil in the parcel. The company said it would have to spend an additional half-billion if it was forced to dismantle miles of pipelines, close hundreds of oil wells and disassemble a dozen platforms.
Executives at Petroecuador say the company's impact on biodiversity is restricted to 80 hectares, or less than 200 acres, a small fraction of the I.T.T. area, and monitored by scientists.
"In terms of area, our footprint is very, very low," Armando Ruiz, who oversees the company's environmental policies, said. For Ecuador's sacrifice to make a difference in the battle against climate change, he said, "the whole world, all governments of this planet, would need to have the same commitment."
Petroecuador recorded a series of videos with the leaders of some Indigenous communities within the I.T.T. area who said they wanted drilling to continue. But major Indigenous organizations in Ecuador are asking voters to choose an end to drilling. Even the Waorani Nationality of Ecuador, a government-recognized group that has partnered with oil companies in the past, is now asking Ecuadoreans to vote to stop drilling in this case.
Fifty years of oil drilling "has simply brought us poverty, problems, diseases, conflict and death," said Juan Bay, the group's president. "The people who benefited were outsiders."

Sales Growth At Walmart Is Barometer: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Holman, Jordyn

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company raised its forecasts for revenue and profit this year, a sign that consumers, the engine of the U.S. economy, remain resilient.
Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected growth in sales and profit as it attracted more shoppers willing to open their wallets, a sign that consumer spending, the engine of the U.S. economy, remains resilient.
Walmart's results capped a week of major retailers opening their books, including Home Depot, Target and TJX, which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. Home Depot and Target reported declines in their latest quarterly sales, while TJX's off-price retailers reported a bigger-than-expected rise in sales and the company revised its forecast for the full year higher, like Walmart.
The earnings offer a glimpse into consumers' purchasing habits as they continue to navigate stubborn inflation and shift their spending from goods like furniture and electronics to services like travel, dining out and going to the movies. Rising prices have brought new shoppers to Walmart, in the form of higher earners attracted by cheaper groceries and other essentials at the big-box stores. By drawing in higher-income shoppers -- a trend that Walmart executives have called out in the past few quarters -- the retailer had an "opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories," Doug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, said.
"It isn't as surprising to us that the consumer is as healthy as they continue to be," said David Silverman, a retail analyst at Fitch Ratings. "I think that what we've been surprised about is that the consumer is still spending on goods while they have clearly been spending more and more on services, particularly this summer."
Walmart's comparable sales rose more than 6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, comfortably beating Wall Street's expectations. Grocery sales were particularly strong, the company said, while spending on general merchandise fell slightly.
Walmart expects to continue drawing in more shoppers, even as economic headwinds like inflation and the resumption of student loan payments squeeze household budgets. Walmart reported a rise in revenue of nearly 6 percent in the second quarter; it expects sales for the full year to grow between 4 and 4.5 percent.
"We see families that are discerning about what they're spending on," Mr. McMillon said on a call with analysts. "They're setting priorities and spending on the things they care most about."
Executives noted that shoppers were buying more private-label brands, groceries and meal options for eating at home.
Foot traffic and the amount spent per trip rose last quarter at Walmart's U.S. stores. The company also reported a 24 percent rise in e-commerce sales. It raised its full-year growth forecasts for the second consecutive quarter.
Executives at a variety of retailers have described a situation in which consumers are wary but still willing to spend.
"A more cautious and value-driven consumer" has affected sales, Rosalind Brewer, the chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, told analysts recently. Customers were "feeling the strain" of high inflation and interest rates, she said, as well as general economic uncertainty and the end of many pandemic stimulus measures. "They are pulling back on discretionary and seasonal spend, and responding strongly to promotional activity," she said.
That said, consumer spending has largely held up, propelled by a resilient labor market and rising wages. Retail sales in July rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier, according to data released on Tuesday, surpassing economists' expectations. In July, many retailers ran promotions around Amazon Prime Day, which has become a significant sales event during the summer.
"Fears of a recession, or at least a severe recession, have largely subsided, and the consumer is generally healthy," Ted Decker, Home Depot's chief executive officer, said Tuesday on an earnings call.
But retail industry watchers have noted that the restart of student loan repayments in October could weigh on consumer spending.
"The upcoming resumption of student loan repayments will put additional pressure on the already-strained budgets of tens of millions of households," Michael Fiddelke, Target's chief financial officer, told analysts on Wednesday. "Against this backdrop, we remain cautious in our planning."
Once back-to-school spending ends, retailers and analysts will look ahead to the crucial holiday shopping season to gauge the health of American consumers. Shoppers will start to see those seasonal products, like lanterns, ornaments and artificial Christmas trees, roll out in a few weeks.
"Typically when back-to-school is strong, it bodes well for what happens with Halloween and Christmas," Mr. McMillon, the Walmart chief, said.

Target Sales Hit by Backlash Over Pride-Tied Merchandise: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The retailer's quarterly sales fell, in part because of boycotts over Pride-themed displays, and it cut its forecast for the full year.
Target on Wednesday said its sales declined in the second quarter, a period in which the retailer faced boycotts and right-wing backlash over its Pride Month collection. The company also slashed its full-year guidance.
Target said its comparable sales fell 5.4 percent in the second quarter, which ended July 29, versus the same period last year. It said both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount declined during the quarter. E-commerce sales fell 10.5 percent.
Despite the sales decline, the company reported higher profit margins than analysts expected, as it offered fewer discounts and reduced its inventory costs.
Target's stock closed up 3 percent on Wednesday.
In May, Target faced criticism and calls for boycotts for its displays and products tied to Pride Month, the annual celebration for the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
Those opposed to the displays had posted themselves entering Target stores and calling out Pride-related children's clothing and greeting cards. Others had thrown some of the merchandise on the ground.
In some locations around the country, the company moved Pride displays to the back of stores and re-evaluated some of its merchandise on its shelves. At the time, the company said it made the decision in the interest of employee safety.
Among the items angering some customers was a one-piece, tuck-friendly swimsuit -- a bathing suit that has extra material for the crotch area for individuals who want to conceal their genitalia. Target said it was available only in adult sizes, though some critics erroneously claimed it was being sold to children. The collection also included children's books about transgender issues and gender fluidity.
On a call with analysts on Wednesday, Target's chief executive, Brian Cornell, addressed the backlash. "As we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we're committed to staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target," he said.
"At the heart of our purpose is our commitment to bring joy to all the families we serve," Mr. Cornell later said in response to a question about how the retailer was approaching inclusivity, particularly when it comes to the L.G.B.T.Q. community. "So we want to make sure Target's that happy place for all of our guests."
Target executives also said that the company saw a "sequential improvement" in foot traffic in July. That month, Target also ran promotions around Amazon Prime Day.
Spending growth has cooled somewhat since pandemic splurges in which big-box retailers like Target benefited from a significant boost in traffic. Target said it expected comparable sales to see a mid-single digit percentage decline for the remainder of the year.
Several major retailers are reporting their latest earnings this week. On Wednesday, TJX, which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, reported a 6 percent jump in comparable sales in the second quarter and raised its forecasts for the year. TJX said it had strong foot traffic to its stores and demand for apparel and home goods. Analysts expect comparable sales at Walmart, which reports earnings on Thursday, to rise about 4 percent in the second quarter.
Another company swept up in the current political and cultural environment in the United States, the beer-making giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, also recently reported a sharp fall in its second-quarter sales, as it counted the cost of a conservative-led boycott of Bud Light after the brand's collaboration with a transgender influencer. The company's revenue in the United States in three months through July fell more than 10 percent from a year earlier. During that period, Bud Light lost its spot as the nation's top-selling beer, to Modelo Especial.

Sherman would routinely carry out his surgical mission in about 15 seconds, leave in as little as 10 minutes and hotfoot it to his car, which was probably parked illegally but perhaps spared a ticket by the inspired placard on his windshield: "Mazel Tov! Bris in progress. Please don't ticket."
Mr. Sherman, whose website (as well as his vanity license plate) was emoil.com, claimed to have performed some 26,000 ritual circumcisions, mostly in the New York metropolitan area, during his 45-year career. He was trained in the Jewish religious practice of brit milah -- a profession generally spelled "mohel" in English and pronounced "moil."
His record, he said, was 11 in a single day, including two pairs of twins -- a considerable scheduling feat, considering that the ritual is to be performed on the eighth day of the baby's life and during daylight.
Mr. Sherman also performed circumcisions on Muslim and Christian infant boys, as well as the son of a man he had circumcised as an infant and the grandsons of two Israeli prime ministers, and in all kinds of places, including Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and a bar on Third Avenue (for a family who lived upstairs).
He died on Aug. 9 at his home in Englewood, N.J. He was 67. His daughter, Nina Sherman Green, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Sherman performed his first circumcision when he was 21, in Brooklyn during a blizzard (prudently, he had stayed over nearby the night before). After his cancer diagnosis, he began what he called a sabbatical in June.
Sporting his signature bow tie, Mr. Sherman did his best to leaven a ceremony that is not for the fainthearted. For Mr. Sherman, it was a living -- and, most important, it was the fulfillment of an enduring and sacred religious covenant, immortalized in the biblical verse "And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son."
"I'm there to fulfill a Torah commandment, to educate, let them know what the significance is, briefly, appropriately, tastefully," he told The New York Times in 2012.
He performed so many brises for Jewish families in New York that he became a boldface name and was written about like a celebrity.
His services did not come cheap. "You pay $ 800 for a steady hand and a good reputation," Scott Stringer, the former New York City comptroller, told The Times after his son, who was born in December 2011, was circumcised by Mr. Sherman. "It's not the kind of thing where you're looking to save money."
But Mr. Sherman said he did not turn away families who could not afford his fee.
Philip Lloyd Sherman was born on April 26, 1956, in Syracuse, N.Y. His mother, Malvina (Jacobs) Sherman, was an English teacher. His father, Paul Sherman, was a factory worker.
He was inspired to study brit milah by his grandfather Isadore Jacobs, who was a mohel and also a rabbi, a cantor, a dayan (a religious judge) and a shochet (a ritual slaughterer). After studying with Rabbi Yosef Hakohen Halperin, a renowned mohel, in Jerusalem, Mr. Sherman graduated in 1979 with degrees in music and Bible studies from a joint program run by Columbia University and the Jewish Theological Seminary.
He also served as a cantor at several synagogues in New York, including the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan from 1985 to 2019. He also occasionally worked as an actor.
He played a judge on the Netflix series "Orange Is the New Black" and appeared in an episode of the Amazon Prime show "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel." He was also cast in the 2011 Paul Rudd movie "Our Idiot Brother."
"I played a mohel, but the scene was cut," he told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. "How ironic."
He described himself as the only motorcycle-riding mohel in the Screen Actors Guild.
In the actual religious ceremonies over which Mr. Sherman presided, he not only starred; he also fed the supporting players their lines.
"Let me tell you my secret," he routinely confided to new fathers, according to an interview with The New Yorker in 1999. "After it's over, be sure to thank your wife for doing a great job and giving you such a perfect son."
In addition to his daughter, Mr. Sherman is survived by two sons, Reuven and Elan Sherman, from his marriage to Naomi Freistat, which ended in divorce; his brothers, Steven and Martin Sherman; and six grandchildren. His marriage in 1994 to Andrea Raab ended in divorce in 2022.
Mr. Sherman performed the brises for his sons and his grandsons, pointing out that in addition to following the biblical injunction to Abraham (rather than deferring to a doctor and turning a religious ceremony into a strictly medical procedure), he had undergone a full year of training.
Yes, he acknowledged, of course the baby feels pain during it. But, he added, "when it's done properly, only for a moment."
And, yes, he said, it was also true that sometimes even just by imagining the removal of the baby's foreskin, one of the parents or a guest might pass out. But, he suggested cheerfully, "usually at a bris, there's no shortage of doctors or lawyers."
When the actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg told him that she hated attending a bris, Mr. Sherman offered her a suggestion.
"The next time you go to one," he advised, "do what I do: Close your eyes."
Just kidding, he added.

As Bond Yields Rise, Shares Take Tumble: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street weakened on Wednesday to worsen what has already been a messy August.
The S&P 500 fell 33.53, or 0.8 percent, to 4,404.33, following the previous day's tumble of 1.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 180.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to 34,765.74, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 156.42, or 1.1 percent, to 13,474.63.
Increased pressure came from the bond market, where yields have recently neared their highest levels since the severe recession of 2007-09 caused interest rates to collapse. Yields climbed more following the afternoon release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.
The minutes suggested that Fed officials were unsure about their next move, after catapulting the main interest rate to its highest level in more than two decades. Hopes had been rising among investors that last month's rate increase by the Fed would prove to be its last for now.
High rates work to grind down inflation by bluntly slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices. The Fed's minutes showed that officials still don not think the job on inflation is done but that they also acknowledge the risk of going too far and torpedoing the economy. They said they would make upcoming decisions based on what data reports about inflation and the economy tell them.
Some analysts took the minutes as a suggestion that another rate hike is possible, while others said it shows the Fed is likely done with its increases.
"Ultimately there were no major surprises in the minutes, as the Fed is expected to remain data dependent when determining the path of monetary policy through the end of the year," said Sam Millette, fixed-income strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network.
Big technology stocks and other investments seen as vulnerable to higher rates were some of the day's heaviest weights on indexes. Tesla fell 3.2 percent. Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, dropped 2.5 percent, and Amazon fell 1.9 percent.
Wall Street has generally been retrenching this month because of several concerns that include worries that the torrid gains made this year through July were overdone and that interest rates may stay high for longer.
A surprisingly strong report on sales at U.S. retailers helped cause Tuesday's slide in stocks, as it suggested that upward pressure on inflation still exists. While strong economic reports calm long-held worries about a possible recession, they could also end up keeping rates higher for longer.
Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. industrial production had improved by more than economists had expected last month. Home builders also broke ground on more homes.
Treasury yields have been generally climbing as reports paint a picture of a still-solid economy. That weighs on stocks because when safe bonds are paying more in interest, investors feel less pressure to pay high prices for stocks and other risky investments.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.26 percent, from 4.22 percent late Tuesday. The yield is close to where it was when the 2007-09 recession sent interest rates crashing. The 10-year yield helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security, which takes inflation into account, is at its highest level since 2009, according to Tradeweb.
On Wall Street, Intel stock fell 3.6 percent after it agreed to call off its $ 5.4 billion buyout of the Israeli chip maker Tower Semiconductor. The deal faced resistance from Chinese regulators.
Agilent Technologies fell 3.4 percent despite reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its forecasts for upcoming results, including revenue for the full year, fell short of expectations. It pointed to a challenging economy, particularly in China.

BookTok Sensation Hits Screens: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The filmmakers didn't want to disappoint fans of Casey McQuiston's novel about the romance between a U.S. president's son and a British prince.
On most Fridays, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London closes at 10 p.m. sharp. But one night last summer, after all of the tourists had spilled back onto the streets of South Kensington, two men slow-danced among the Berninis and Rodins until the sun rose the next morning. A cover of "Can't Help Falling in Love" by the indie-pop singer Perfume Genius echoed through the sculpture hall, soundtracking their tender moment.
The nocturnal scene was a scripted one from "Red, White & Royal Blue," the film adaptation of the 2019 novel by Casey McQuiston. The two men under the dimmed lights were the actors Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine, and they swayed until the director, Matthew López, called "Cut!" around 2 a.m. for a lunch break.
"It was just the three of us and our crew," said López, who's also the film's co-writer. "It made for an incredibly intimate, really special night."
The romantic comedy follows Alex Claremont-Diaz, the bisexual son of the first female U.S. president (played by Uma Thurman, with a thick Southern drawl), and Prince Henry, the younger brother of the heir to the British throne who has known since birth that he's "gay as a maypole." What starts as a simmering rivalry between the impulsive American (Zakhar Perez) and the buttoned-up Brit (Galitzine) soon develops into a clandestine relationship. Neither is publicly out, and their secret love complicates things, especially for Henry.
Amazon Studios and Berlanti Productions secured the film rights to McQuiston's novel at auction ahead of its May 2019 release, and the book has since spent more than 20 weeks as a New York Times best seller.
But best-seller lists don't fully convey the adoration that "Red, White & Royal Blue" has garnered on BookTok -- the literature-loving corner of TikTok -- where fans have shared their obsession with the escapist love story en masse, and videos tagged #redwhiteandroyalblue have received more than 500 million views.
Jacob Demlow, who frequently posts about "Red, White & Royal Blue" on his "A Very Queer Book Club" account, said he flung his copy across the room in delight when he first encountered it.
"I couldn't believe what I was reading. It was all these amazing tropes that romance lovers have loved forever, but there was a couple in it who looked like a couple I would be in," said Demlow, who estimated that he'd read the novel at least a dozen times. "I grew up watching movies about the girl falling in love with the prince, but I'd never seen that through a queer lens before. It was kind of earth-shattering in ways I still don't fully know if I can comprehend."
The film, premiering on Prime Video on Friday, hopes to recreate that excitement onscreen, and represents the directorial debut of López, a Tony-winning playwright known for penning "The Inheritance," as well as writing (with Amber Ruffin) the musical adaptation "Some Like It Hot." López was working on those projects in 2020 when his agent first floated the idea of turning "Red, White & Royal Blue" into a stage musical.
"I read it and said, 'Yeah, sure, maybe. But let's talk about the movie,"' López recalled. "I knew I wanted to be the person who made this film by, like, Page 50."
After pleading his case to the producers Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, López signed on to direct and did a second pass on an original script by Ted Malawer. He cast two lead actors who had cut their teeth on Netflix romances: Zakhar Perez, 31, who starred as Marco in "The Kissing Booth" sequels; and Galitzine, 28, who appeared in the streamer's military romance "Purple Hearts." Galitzine also played the prince in Amazon's Camila Cabello-led "Cinderella."
For both Zakhar Perez and the director, the character Alex's biracial identity was particularly meaningful. López grew up in Panama City, Fla., with his Puerto Rican father and Polish Russian mother, while Zakhar Perez is of Mexican, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent and was raised in northwest Indiana, where he said there was only one other Mexican family.
"Matthew and I talked a lot about the mestizo journey," Zakhar Perez said in a video call before SAG-AFTRA, the actor's union, went on strike. "Being part Mexican, part lots of other things, I don't want to say you're forgotten, but in today's world, it's like, you're either this or you're that. There's nothing in between. I'm kind of a cultural chameleon."
"As a young Latiné queer man, I never read something that centered someone like Alex," López said, echoing his star. "If I had been presented with this character when I was in my late teens, early 20s, it may have changed how I thought about myself."
During the audition process, Zakhar Perez and Galitzine did their chemistry reads via video and did not meet in person until rehearsals began in London. But the nature of the script meant they would need to quickly become comfortable shooting a variety of passionate scenes, which were overseen by the intimacy coordinator Robbie Taylor Hunt.
"Nick and I trusted each other quite quickly," Zakhar Perez said of Galitzine. "We had to build a sexual tension from dislike to like to love, and we wanted to show that journey through the choreographed, intimate moments."
In the book, McQuiston described Alex and Henry's amorous bedroom -- and tack room and hotel room -- scenes in great detail, and López said he "never, ever shied away from the sexuality" onscreen.
"At times, it's extremely hungry and at times, it's really tender," Galitzine said in a separate prestrike call. "Matthew was always adamant that he wanted to portray gay sex in an accurate way, which he felt maybe hadn't been the case in other L.G.B.T.Q.+ movies."
While the only lingering sex scene is a carefully cropped, emotional moment, and the only nudity is the flash of a naked buttocks, "Red, White & Royal Blue" received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association.
López was surprised: "If we had put six bullets into the prince, we probably would have still gotten PG-13," he said, and added, "If it had been a man and a woman, I question whether or not it would have gotten an R rating."
(The filmmaker Ira Sachs recently expressed similar confusion over the NC-17 rating for his new film "Passages," which also features gay sex. The M.P.A. said in a statement to The Associated Press, "The sexual orientation of a character or characters is not considered as part of the rating process.")
In the weeks leading up to the movie's release, anticipation continued to build among fans, coupled with fears that it might not capture the magic of the book. Some worried about the casting choices, the elimination of several supporting characters or the switch from a fictional queen of England to a fictional king, played in a single scene by Stephen Fry.
"I was never going to entirely fulfill the image of this book that the millions of people who love it individually have in their heads," López said. "I knew from the beginning," he also emphasized, "that this movie would succeed or fail based in part on the fans' belief that one of them has made this film. I am one of them."
Broader critiques take issue with the premise of the story itself and the fact that it's yet another queer romance that involves the distress of coming out. But Demlow of A Very Queer Book Club sees it differently.
"There are so many coming-out stories that need to be heard, and we also need more stories that aren't coming-out stories," he said. "It's not that we need less of something. It's that we need more of everything."

A Messy Relationship With Romance Novels: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Hockey romance is a thriving literary subgenre, but some of its fans on TikTok are creating content that blurs the line between fictional players and real-life ones, dividing the community.
The niche world of hockey romance novels is getting mainstream attention after the wife of an N.H.L. player criticized book fans who she said had made comments and videos on social media about her husband that were "predatory and exploiting."
Here's what happened when the worlds of professional sports, romance novels and TikTok collided.
First, there was BookTok.
On TikTok, people share book recommendations and reviews under the hashtag #BookTok, and the community has become a powerful force in publishing: More than 100 authors with large BookTok followings drove $ 760 million in sales in 2022, a 60 percent increase from 2021, according to Circana BookScan, which tracks print sales.
Romance is a big part of the BookTok universe, as is its popular subgenre hockey romance, which falls under the broader sports-romance category.
Recent hits have included Anna Zabo and L.A. Witt's "Scoreless Game," a love story between two longtime friends who are players on the fictional Pittsburgh Griffins. In "Overnight Sensation," by Sarina Bowen, an office intern for the fictional Brooklyn Bruisers moves in with a player after leaving the condo she lives in with her father, the hockey league's commissioner.
The success of these books has been credited with driving interest among readers in ice hockey, and some professional and collegiate teams have embraced this new audience.
In Australia, where ice hockey is not particularly popular, professional teams have credited BookTok with increasing game attendance and fan interest.
Sarah Bricknall, the events and media manager for the Melbourne Mustangs, told The Hills Shire Times, a Sydney newspaper, that 15 to 30 BookTok fans had been at every home game since the team joined TikTok in May.
How did things go wrong?
On the internet, the lines between fictional players and real-life ones can blur, especially when teams use BookTok to promote themselves.
A video posted to the Seattle Kraken's official TikTok account that has since been archived showed Alex Wennberg, a center for the team, walking down a hallway in a suit with the text "when you accidentally become a booktok account & now that's all you can post."
Other posts by romance fans on BookTok have talked about a specific player as a stand-in for a favorite fictional hockey player or showed game footage overlaid with quotes from hockey romance books. A segment of these posts are sexually explicit, and some fans have posted explicit comments on players' personal social media accounts.
Emily Rath, the author of "Pucking Around," a romance best seller on Amazon, said on TikTok that some fans had raised concerns about inappropriate behavior directed at players earlier this year.
"True hockey romance readers have been here before," Ms. Rath said on TikTok. "We watched it all unfold in April, we were ringing the alarm bells, we were asking that it stop."
The conflict peaked when an N.H.L. player's wife got involved.
The issue started to attract attention from outside the romance world in July, when Felicia Wennberg, the wife of Alex Wennberg, said that some posts about her husband had gone too far.
Ms. Wennberg said on Instagram Stories that while she had initially joked about some of the videos and comments, they had since "crossed the line of what it means to fancy someone and when it actually sounds pretty predatory and exploiting."
Her statement described what she considered acceptable, such as positive comments about her husband's looks, and what she did not, such as chanting "krak my back" at players at games. She asked people to "think twice" about their posts.
In response, her Instagram account was flooded with harassing messages.
Mr. Wennberg then issued a statement on social media about the "vile comments."
"We can all take a joke and funny comments but when it turns personal and into something bigger that affects our family, we need to tell you that we've had enough," he wrote. "Enough of sexual harassment, and harassment of our character and our relationship."
The Kraken has since removed its TikTok posts about BookTok.
How did TikTok creators respond?
The sexually explicit posts were made by a small sliver of the BookTok community.
One creator, Kierra Lewis, had made a video that Ms. Wennberg cited as an example of inappropriate behavior, and Ms. Lewis has since posted a handful of videos responding to the situation.
Ms. Lewis, who has 1.1 million followers on TikTok, had been flown out to a Kraken game earlier this year after she posted videos featuring explicit comments about N.H.L. players, including Mr. Wennberg.
She said that she had privately messaged Ms. Wennberg on Instagram to apologize. Ms. Lewis said that the Kraken TikTok account had unfollowed her, leaving her "confused and upset."
In her videos responding to the controversy, Ms. Lewis expressed frustration with the team for backing away after it encouraged her, and with Ms. Wennberg for using one of Ms. Lewis's posts as an example. She defended her videos by saying that TikTok is for "entertainment."
Ms. Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.
The Kraken said in a statement that they had originally engaged with BookTok to connect with new audiences, but were reminded by this situation "that unintended consequences may arise."
"It is disappointing that a small percentage of online commenters crossed a line," the statement said. "We consider this a learning moment for the organization and have taken appropriate action."

Sobering Fact of Hawaii Fire: As Planet Warms, No Place Is Safe: [National Desk]

Full text: Declining rainfall, rising temperatures and invasive species have left the islands more susceptible to wildfires.
The fires in Hawaii would be shocking anywhere -- killing at least 36 people, in one of the deadliest wildfires in the United States in modern history. But the devastation is especially striking because of where it happened: In a state defined by its lush vegetation, a far cry from the dry landscape normally associated with fire threats.
The explanation is as straightforward as it is sobering: As the planet heats up, no place is protected from disasters.
The story of this week's blaze arguably began decades ago, when Hawaii started experiencing a long-term decline in average annual rainfall. Since 1990, rainfall at selected monitoring sites has been 31 percent lower in the wet season, and 6 percent lower in the dry season, according to work published in 2015 by researchers at the University of Hawaii and the University of Colorado.
There are multiple reasons for that change, according to Abby Frazier, a climatologist at Clark University who has researched Hawaii.
One factor is La Niña, a weather pattern that has usually led to significant rainfall but began delivering less precipitation beginning in the 1980s. Those weaker La Niñas "are not bringing us out of drought," Dr. Frazier said in an interview earlier this year.
Another change: As temperatures increase, the clouds over Hawaii are thinner, Dr. Frazier said. And less cloud cover means less precipitation. On top of that, big storms have been moving north over time -- delivering less of the rainfall that they typically bring to the islands.
All three changes are probably related to rising temperatures, Dr. Frazier said. "There's likely a climate change signal in everything we see," she said.
Almost 16 percent of Maui County, where the wildfires are burning, is in severe drought, according to data issued by the U.S. Drought Monitor on Thursday; an additional 20 percent is in moderate drought.
As average annual rainfall has been decreasing, average temperatures in Hawaii, like elsewhere in the world, have increased, further drying out the vegetation. In a paper published in 2019, University of Hawaii researchers wrote that 2016 was warmer than the 100-year mean by .92 degrees Celsius, and temperatures had been inching up by .19 Celsius per decade at the Mauna Loa Observatory.
Hawaii's landscape is changing in other ways, beyond becoming drier. As wildfires become more common, some native vegetation, which is poorly adapted to fire, has been destroyed. In other places, including the area around Lahaina, longstanding sugar cane farms stopped operating around the 1990s; the land stopped getting irrigated.
In the place of those crops and native vegetation, dry and invasive grasses spread. Those grasses that are better able to regrow after a fire, but are also quick to ignite. That has contributed to fires spreading more quickly.
"The landscape is just covered with flammable stuff," said Ryan Longman, a research fellow at the East-West Center, an educational institution. "All of the conditions just came together."
The drying out of Hawaii's landscape is part of a trend affecting rainforests around the globe.
Rainforests are highly sensitive to changes in precipitation. Higher temperatures, drought and changes in rain patterns stress trees. Their trunks dry up, and their leaves fall. Thinning canopy allows sun rays to reach the soil, causing it to dry up quickly.
Over decades, drought, heat, fire and deforestation can force a rainforest to transition into dry grasslands, or savanna.
Parts of the Amazon rainforest, the biggest in the world, are fast approaching this transition, a point of no return when the humid ecosystem would forever change.
Degraded forests and changing weather patterns combine to create perfect conditions for fires, often started by human activity, to grow into enormous, uncontrollable blazes. In tropical forests, tree loss because of fire has grown 5 percent on average each year over the past 20 years, according to recent research.
Those underlying threats were amplified in Hawaii this week by a separate threat: Hurricane Dora, which passed south of Hawaii as a Category 4 storm on Tuesday. Though the storm was hundreds of miles off the coast of Maui, it contributed to wind speeds of greater than 60 miles per hour, helping the fire to spread at a ferocious speed.
It's difficult to directly attribute any single hurricane to climate change. But by increasing air and ocean temperatures, warming conditions make it more likely for large storms to gain strength.
"The massive winds, dry winds, are what drove this fire," said Josh Stanbro, who served as chief resilience officer for Honolulu. "This is part of a long-term trend that is directly related to climate changes and impacts on the islands."

As Strike Thwarts Production, Viewers Catch Up on TV Glut: [National Desk]

Full text: After years of being inundated with new shows, some are using a pause in production to finally watch all the stuff they missed when it came out.
With Hollywood's labor disputes grinding on, and virtually all production stopped, anxiety began creeping into Zain Habboo's house in Chevy Chase, Md.
She and her husband had recently finished the latest season of HBO's "The Righteous Gemstones," but now they were worried that new episodes of favorite shows like "The Handmaid's Tale" would be significantly delayed.
What on earth were they going to watch?
Ms. Habboo, 49, quickly realized she had options. She might revisit classics like "30 Rock" and "Arrested Development" with her 17-year-old son. She could join him in watching a show he's bingeing, like all 62 episodes of "Breaking Bad." She has also never seen any of the "Mission Impossible" movies, and she has barely made a dent in the Oscar-nominated films from the past four or five years.
For many viewers, the writers' and actors' strikes in Hollywood will soon be felt in the form of altered film release schedules and prime-time lineups littered with game shows, reality TV and reruns.
At the same time, the pause in new scripted material provides a moment for many viewers to catch up after the breakneck pace of the so-called Peak TV era, when dozens of shows were premiering each month.
"I have a Netflix queue that is so deep and so long, it would take me months or a year or two to go through it all," said Dan Leonhardt, a 44-year-old engineer who lives in Copenhagen. "And that's just Netflix! I also have a Max subscription."
The slowdown will represent a major shift from recent years, when viewers were inundated with a fire hose of content -- a record 599 new television scripted premieres last year.
On almost a daily basis, audiences found themselves clicking past new shows on their TVs, often ones they had never heard of, trying to figure out from a one-sentence description whether a series like "Altered Carbon" on Netflix or "The Path" on Hulu was worth their time.
For streaming services, the strategy was straightforward: The more shows they produced, the more chances they had to attract subscribers. The number of people who watched any one show wasn't as important as the number of people who paid for the service.
So the promise of a constant flow of new stuff became a hallmark of the streaming era. One of the outstanding questions as the labor stalemate goes on has been whether viewers would start to cancel subscriptions to streaming services en masse when fewer new shows and movies became available.
For many, though, a slower output is just fine, giving them time to pick their way through streaming libraries, one missed TV series and movie at a time.
Emily Nidetz, a 41-year-old in Madison, Wis., said she was relieved that production for reality series had not been affected and that there were still plenty of sports to watch. And though she is worried about a slowdown in prestige shows, she said she could always stop by a Facebook community page for The Ringer's podcast "The Watch" to get some ideas.
"If you go to the Facebook page and write, 'Hey, I really loved "The Bear," tell me what to watch,' there will be like 400 replies," she said.

Tasha Quinn, a 36-year-old therapist from Chicago, said there was a moment last year when she was so overwhelmed by the conveyor belt of new series that she finally had to take a break. HBO's "House of the Dragon" was the breaking point.
"I made it through two episodes, and didn't finish it," she said. "There was too much hype, and there were a lot of other things coming out at the same time. I was like, nope, I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too overstimulated, I'll just go back to my comfort shows. I'm going to go watch 'The Office."'
Ms. Quinn said that the labor disputes had worried her briefly because new episodes of the dystopian workplace drama "Severance" on AppleTV+ would be delayed -- but that she then quickly thought of the upside.
"I can take my time without everyone talking about what's coming next," she said, adding that she's currently wrapping up "Succession."
The length of the labor disputes will determine the length of the disruption. Actors have been on strike since July 14. Writers have been walking picket lines for more than 100 days. Formal talks between the writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, were held on Friday for the first time since early May. No talks involving the actors are scheduled.
Third-party researchers believe that most of the streaming services should be well insulated if the strikes last another month or two -- though that risk rises the longer production is shut down. The amount of content in their streaming libraries was one reason the studios initially said they could weather the strikes, at least in the short term, a pointed message to writers and actors currently going without paychecks. (For instance, "Suits," a USA Network show that went off the air in 2019, has recently surged in popularity on Netflix.)
Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents thousands of striking screenwriters, recently said it was "disinformation" that the strike would have "no impact because streaming services have libraries and some product in the pipeline."
"It is not a viable business strategy for these companies to shut down their business for three months -- and counting -- no matter how much they try and pretend it is," they said in a note to members.
Many viewers say they support the striking writers and actors. Ms. Habboo said she believed they were not being fairly compensated, and "that is a huge bummer."
Still, when asked if she would cut any of her streaming subscriptions, she was emphatic. "Don't be ridiculous," she said. "Canceling is never an option."
Mel Russo, a 56-year-old yoga teacher who lives in Brooklyn, said the Max service alone "could keep you busy for the next 10 years, to be honest."
"I think it's disgusting what's going on," she added. "But I am not in dire straits about it as a watcher and as a lover of entertainment."
The streaming services seem keen to capitalize. Last month, Netflix rolled out a new banner, "10 Years of Netflix Series," which presents viewers with dozens of older titles from its library.
Eric Martinez, a 25-year-old video producer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, had been a big fan of the HBO series "Euphoria." But the earliest that show will return for its third season is now 2025, so he went looking for an alternative.
On his Amazon Prime page, Mr. Martinez had been seeing a tile for the show "The Boys" for some time. The superhero series was one he thought he had no interest in. But with time on his hands, he finally took the plunge. "I'm enjoying it, and I'm glad I started it," he said.
Not all the viewers need a new old show to watch.
Brenda Stewart, a 71-year-old Nebraskan, said she and her husband often fired up their Roku and watched reruns of older series including "CSI" and "Murder, She Wrote." She's also a big fan of rewatching movies like "The Lion King" and other Disney classics.
Ms. Stewart, who has six grandchildren, said it was not uncommon to have "Bluey" episodes playing again and again in her house when the children were over. And, sometimes, it's not exclusively for the little ones.
"It's a cartoon series for kids, but I'm not going to lie -- it's also for adults," she said, laughing. "There's stuff in there that just makes me chuckle."

What Does It Mean to Own a Book?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the pandemic emergency, Brewster Kahle's Internet Archive freely lent out digital scans of its library. Publishers sued. Owning a book means something different now.
Information wants to be free. That observation, first made in 1984, anticipated the internet and the world to come. It cost nothing to digitally reproduce data and words, and so we have them in numbing abundance.
Information also wants to be expensive. The right information at the right time can save a life, make a fortune, topple a government. Good information takes time and effort and money to produce.
Before it turned brutally divisive, before it alarmed librarians, even before the lawyers were unleashed, the latest battle between free and expensive information started with a charitable gesture.
Brewster Kahle runs the Internet Archive, a venerable tech nonprofit. In that miserable, frightening first month of the Covid pandemic, he had the notion to try to help students, researchers and general readers. He unveiled the National Emergency Library, a vast trove of digital books mostly unavailable elsewhere, and made access to it a breeze.
This good deed backfired spectacularly. Four publishers claimed "willful mass copyright infringement" and sued. They won. On Friday, the publishers said through their trade association that they had negotiated a deal with the archive that would remove all their copyright books from the site.
"The proposed judgment is an appropriately serious bookend to the court's decisive finding of liability," said Maria Pallante, chief executive of the Association of American Publishers. "We feel very good about it."
The archive had a muted response, saying that it expected there would be changes to its lending program but that their full scope was unknown. There is also an undisclosed financial payment if the archive loses on appeal.
The case has generated a great deal of bitterness, and the deal, which requires court approval, is likely to generate more. Each side accuses the other of bad faith, and calls its opponents well-funded zealots who won't listen to reason and want to destroy the culture.
In the middle of this mess are writers, whose job is to produce the books that contain much of the world's best information. Despite that central role, they are largely powerless -- a familiar position for most writers. Emotions are running high.
Six thousand writers signed a petition supporting the lawsuit, and a thousand names are on a petition denouncing it. The Romance Writers of America and the Western Writers of America joined a brief in favor of the publishers, while Authors Alliance, a group of 2,300 academics whose mission is to serve the public good by widely sharing their creations, submitted a brief for the archive.
It's rarely this nasty, but free vs. expensive is a struggle that plays out continuously against all forms of media and entertainment. Neither side has the upper hand forever, even if it sometimes seems it might.
"The more information is free, the more opportunities for it to be collected, refined, packaged and made expensive," said Stewart Brand, the technology visionary who first developed the formulation. "The more it is expensive, the more workarounds to make it free. It's a paradox. Each side makes the other true."
A Cultural Tug of War
Universal access to all knowledge was a dream of the early internet. It's an idea that Mr. Kahle (pronounced "kale") has long championed. As the United States lurched to a halt in March 2020, he saw an opportunity. The Internet Archive would be a temporary bridge between beleaguered readers and the volumes shut away in libraries and schools.
It didn't turn out that way, not a bit -- the emergency library shut down in June 2020 -- and three years later Mr. Kahle remained angry and frustrated. There was one bright spot. The Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, the capital of Silicon Valley, had just passed a resolution in support of digital libraries and the Internet Archive.
The resolution was largely symbolic, but the message was exactly the one that Mr. Kahle had been trying to get across without much success, particularly in court. It championed "the essential rights of all libraries to own, preserve and lend both digital and print books."
"Libraries came before publishers," the 62-year-old librarian said in a recent interview in the former Christian Science church in western San Francisco that houses the archive. "We came before copyright. But publishers now think of libraries as customer service departments for their database products."
Librarians are custodians. Mr. Kahle has spent his career working in tech, but he wants the future to behave a little more like the past.
"If I pay you for an e-book, I should own that book," he said. "Companies used to sell things. Media companies now rent them instead. It's like they have tentacles. You pull the book off the shelf and say, 'I think I'll keep this,' and then the tentacle yanks it back."
Some necessary background: When a physical book is sold, the "first sale" provision of copyright law says the author and publisher have no control over that volume's fate in the world. It can be resold, and they don't get a cut. It can be lent out as many times as readers demand. The information in the text flows freely through society without leaving a trace. Religions and revolutions have been built on this.
Thanks to their digital nature, e-books are treated much differently. They can't be resold or given away. A library that wants to lend e-books must buy a license from the copyright holder. These subscriptions can be limited to a number of reads, or by periods of a year or two. Everything is tracked. Libraries own nothing.
The Internet Archive's lending program, developed long before the pandemic, involved scanning physical books and offering them to readers in its Open Library, a practice called controlled digital lending.
One reader at a time could borrow each scanned book. If the library or one of its partners had two copies, two readers at a time could borrow it. The archive defended making its own e-books by citing fair use, a broad legal concept that permits copyrighted material to be quoted and excerpted, and the first-sale doctrine: It could do what it wanted with its own books.
No dice, wrote Judge John G. Koeltl of U.S. District Court in Manhattan. His decision granting summary judgment for the publishers in March went far beyond the pandemic library. Any benefit for research and cultural participation, he said, was outweighed by harm to the publishers' bottom line.
The Internet Archive lost its court battle at a moment of rising concern about whether tech, entertainment and media companies are up to the job of maintaining the public's access to a wide-ranging culture. Warner Bros. Discovery, for example, wanted to scale back its Turner Classic Movies cable channel, a citadel of cinema history and art. It was stopped by an uproar.
New technology means culture is delivered on demand, but not all culture. When Netflix shipped DVDs to customers, there were about 100,000 to choose from. Streaming, which has a different economics, has reduced that to about 6,600 U.S. titles. Most are contemporary. Only a handful of movies on Netflix were made between 1940 and 1970.
Libraries have traditionally been sanctuaries for culture that could not afford to pay its own way, or that was lost or buried or didn't fit current tastes. But that is at risk now.
"The permanence of library collections may become a thing of the past," said Jason Schultz, director of New York University's Technology Law & Policy Clinic. "If the platforms decide not to offer the e-books or publishers decide to pull them off the shelves, the reader loses out. This is similar to when songs you look for on Spotify are blanked out because the record company ended the license or when movies or television shows cycle off Netflix or Amazon."
The triumphant publishers -- HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, Hachette and John Wiley & Sons -- declined to comment through the Association of American Publishers. In its "reflections" on the case, the publishers' group said it was simply protecting the rights of writers.
"In the world of publishing, authors are our heroes," it said.
The publishers association said the archive was unrepentant and impossible to negotiate with: It "refused to halt or engage in discussions, and after being sued, it chose to accelerate its activities."
Mr. Kahle denied refusing to negotiate. "They never approached us -- they just sued," he said.
The Authors Guild, which submitted a brief on behalf of the publishers, said Mr. Kahle and his supporters needed to recognize that rights available to owners of physical books simply did not make sense in the digital era.
"Digital is different than print because it is infinitely copyable and unprotectable," said Mary Rasenberger, the chief executive of the guild and a copyright lawyer. "If anyone could call themselves a library, set up a website and do the exact same thing the archive did, writers would have absolutely no control over their work anymore."
Traditional libraries promote discovery, but publishers perennially worry that they cost sales.
"Most publishers are not purely profit-driven," Ms. Rasenberger said. "If one were, you could imagine it might not allow libraries to have e-books at all."
Writers Caught in the Middle
The Internet Archive is best known for the Wayback Machine, which allows access to web pages of the past. Mr. Kahle is a longtime fixture in digital information circles, an enthusiast whose zeal is palpable.
He was an entrepreneur of information in the 1990s, culminating in a search and web analysis engine called Alexa, after the Library of Alexandria. Amazon bought Alexa in 1999 for $ 250 million, years before it introduced a personal assistant with the same name. Mr. Kahle turned his full attention to the archive, which he founded in 1996 and now employs about a hundred people. It is supported by donations, grants and the scanning it does for other libraries.
In 2021, when the archive celebrated its 25th anniversary, Mr. Kahle talked about the fate of the internet in an era of megacorporations: "Will this be our medium or will it be theirs? Will it be for a small controlling set of organizations or will it be a common good, a public resource?"
The archive had been lending book scans for years. Publishers did not like it but did not sue. What made the pandemic emergency library different was that the brakes were removed. If 10 people, or 100 people, wanted to read a particular book, they could all do so at once.
The emergency library "was as limited as a small city library's circulation level," Mr. Kahle insisted. "This was always under control."
But it did not appear that way to the writers who took to Twitter to point out that the books in the library were written by human beings who were often poorly paid and not benefiting from this free information at all.
Margaret Owen, an author of popular books for young adults, wrote in a 23-post broadside on Twitter that offering up free books to an audience that could afford to pay for them was, "at this point in history, cutting into our money for hospital and/or funeral bills."
The publishers sued over 127 titles, many by well-known writers, including J.D. Salinger, Sylvia Plath, James Patterson, John Grisham and Malcolm Gladwell. They asked damages of $ 150,000 per book.
Some writers had second thoughts. N.K. Jemisin and Colson Whitehead deleted their critical tweets. Ms. Owen, asked last month by The New York Times if she stood by her tweets, responded by making her account private. Chuck Wendig, a science fiction writer, tweeted in the heat of the moment that the emergency library was "piracy." He was quoted in news reports and criticized by archive fans, and now has a post expressing regrets.
Mr. Wendig says he had no part in the lawsuit and does not support it. Three of the plaintiffs are his publishers, but they have "very little regard for me and do not listen to me at all," he wrote in a blog post.
Some writers -- ones who generally do not depend on their writing to make a living -- were always against the suit.
"Authors of all types fight constantly against the risk of digital obscurity; for many readers, especially younger readers, if a book is not online, it effectively does not exist to them," wrote Authors Alliance, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., in its brief in support of the archive. (Mr. Kahle is on the alliance's 25-member advisory board but played no part in the brief.)
A third group of writers have continued and even deepened their opposition to the archive.
Douglas Preston, a best-selling thriller writer, pretty much single-handedly led a wing of the writing community in opposition to Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, when the bookseller was embroiled in a dispute with Hachette several years ago. Mr. Preston, a former president of the Authors Guild, now sees Mr. Kahle and his philosophy as more of a threat than Mr. Bezos.
"Capitalists may be obnoxious and selfish and in firm need of restraint, but the truly dangerous people in this world are the true believers who want to impose their utopian vision on everyone else," Mr. Preston said.
Writers, he added, "are subjected to disparagement and online abuse whenever we defend copyright or push back on the 'information wants to be free' movement. On tech websites we're told we're selfish, we're Luddites, we're elitists."
Information Wants to Be Easy
Among the many points on which the two sides disagree is how many libraries across the country were lending scans of copyrighted material. Only a few, say the publishers, who paint the Internet Archive as an outlier; many, says the archive, which argues this is a broad trend.
Karl Stutzman is the director of library services at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary in Elkhart, Ind. He recently had a request from a faculty member for excerpts from a 30-year-old theology text to use in a class in Ethiopia, where the seminary has students. No e-book was available, and a query to the publisher went nowhere.
In the past, the library would have cited fair use and provided scans to the students via secure software, but after the March court ruling, Mr. Stutzman said, it's unclear what is allowed. One chapter? Two? How many students can see a scan? Fifty? Five?
"I'm caught between enforcing the current legal paradigms around copyright and allowing my colleagues to have academic freedom in what they assign students to read," Mr. Stutzman said. He plans to tell teachers that they need to choose material that is easy to license, even if it is not necessarily the best, until there is more legal clarity.
That clarity would come from an appeal, which Mr. Kahle said he intended to mount. In the meantime, it's business as usual at the archive. The National Emergency Library may be history, but the Open Library division still offers scans of many books under copyright. Loans are for one hour or for two weeks "if the book is fully borrowable," a term that is not defined.
Some of that is likely to change soon.
The agreement filed on Friday went far beyond dropping the 127 titles from the archive to also removing what the publishers called their "full book catalogs." Exactly how comprehensive this will be is up to the judge.
A separate deal between the publishers association and the archive will provide an incentive for the archive to take down works by any publisher that is a member of the trade group. The incentive: not getting sued again.
In a 1996 book available through the Internet Archive, David Bunnell, an early software chronicler of the personal computer revolution, said Mr. Kahle was "brilliant" but "very introspective and unsure of himself."
"If he had Bill Gates's confidence, he would change the world," Mr. Bunnell said.
Mr. Kahle is more sure of himself now, and quite determined to change the world.
Asked if he had made any mistakes, he ignored the question and returned to the attack: "I wish the publishers had not sued, but it demonstrates how important it is that libraries stand firm on buying, preserving and lending the treasures that are books."

Full text: After 16 years together, Sachi Takahashi-Rial and George Carollo drew up a timeline, which included a decision to legally tie the knot in 2023.
Sachi Alita Takahashi-Rial and George Carl Gaetano Carollo sent out their online wedding invitations in March, which left some people amused, and others guessing.
It said: "You're invited to the first Investor Offsite for pre-eminent investors worldwide. This exclusive event combines insights, innovation, vision, and, of course, cake."
Questions then quickly rolled in, mostly to their parents, regarding the unconventional three-day celebration at Yin Ranch, a 40-acre event venue in Vacaville, Calif., from Nov. 3 to 5.
"Are you getting married or raising a venture capital fund?" asked one friend.
After all, Mr. Carollo, 34, is a founder and the chief operating officer of Dover, a job recruiting technology platform start-up. He graduated with distinction with two bachelor's degrees, one in economics and another in urban studies, from Stanford, from which he also received a master's degree in civil and environmental engineering.
"Our sense of humor doesn't translate all the way," said Ms. Takahashi-Rial, 33, an associate director of partner services at Listen4Good, which assists nonprofit groups in getting feedback from their constituents.
She graduated with distinction with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley and received a master of public policy from Duke.
The two, together for 17 years, grew up in the same neighborhood in Sacramento, Calif., and got their start working on at least a dozen projects and studying together in high school. But it took them a while to get to that point.
They barely noticed each other in their sixth grade class at James R. Cowan Fundamental Elementary, and then she did her best to avoid him all through Arcade Fundamental Middle School.
"He was very uncool," Ms. Takahashi-Rial said.
Her attitude changed once they ended up in a highly competitive international baccalaureate program at Mira Loma High School -- she lived across the street; he three traffic lights away.
"It was an exceptionally nerdy place," said Mr. Carollo, who also had a growth spurt the summer before, and even became popular. "It was like AP classes on steroids."
They began hanging out with friends either at "the bench," a gathering spot on campus, or on AOL Instant Messenger after school and on weekends.
At her house sophomore year, they and classmates built a 15-foot-long float with thousands of flowers out of crepe paper folded, fluffed, and wrapped around chicken wire for an annual homecoming float competition. It won first place.

On Apr. 4, 2006, after studying for a biology exam junior year at her house, they walked over to the school baseball diamond and sat in the bleachers. Neither was dating anyone, and they had recently become flirty.
"She made a move and kissed me," he said.
Instead of going to the junior prom as friends, they went as boyfriend and girlfriend.
After graduation, they dated long distance, and spoke every day while he attended Stanford and she started out at the University of the Pacific, and then transferred to Berkeley two years later.
In 2015, after years of living together and apart, they moved into a big house with friends in the Cole Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. Two years later they all picked up and moved into another big house in the Duboce Triangle area.
"It was wonderful," he said, recalling late-night conversations, Thursday night family-style dinners and house parties.
For five years, Ms. Takahashi-Rial and Mr. Carollo entertained friends and family with their annual EOY memos, their End of Year spoof on a Christmas letter, sounding all-important on trivial matters, until the pandemic hit, and they got more serious.
In 2021 they were ready to leave San Francisco, put all their furniture in storage and packed up their Mini Cooper. They then stopped in places including Los Angeles, Dallas and Knoxville. By spring they rendezvoused with friends in Brooklyn.
After a couple of months, in August 2021, they got an apartment near the Empire State Building, and racked up about 10 miles each weekend exploring the city by foot.
To decorate, "we bought cheap stuff off Amazon," she said, and usually put two Ikea desks together for dinner parties.
In May 2022, when they decided to get a real dining room table, questions sprang up about their future. So they began mapping it out on a Google spreadsheet, labeled "Life Planning," on Mr. Carollo's laptop, and made a timeline on another tab. (They have 10 tabs now.)
"Would we move back to Bay Area, do we want kids in New York, and should we get married?" she said. "There wasn't a proposal. There was just a decision. We just project managed ourselves."
On July 28, George T. Carollo, a Universal Life minister, who is the groom's father, officiated outside the Sacramento courthouse, and without a fuss signed their marriage certificate before two witnesses, the groom's sister and her husband, in a parking area.
Afterward, they drove over to Frank Fat's, a local Chinese restaurant, to celebrate with family, and enjoyed its signature banana cream pie for dessert.
In November, they expect about 130 guests to join them during their three-day "investor offsite," which will include activity-themed breakout groups ranging from basketball games to cake-decorating, as well as dinner and toasts.
"We're excited to have a good party with the people who invested in us," she said.

The Dream Was Universal Access to Knowledge. The Result Was a Fiasco.

Information wants to be free. That observation, first made in 1984, anticipated the internet and the world to come. It cost nothing to digitally reproduce data and words, and so we have them in numbing abundance.
Information also wants to be expensive. The right information at the right time can save a life, make a fortune, topple a government. Good information takes time and effort and money to produce.
Before it turned brutally divisive, before it alarmed librarians, even before the lawyers were unleashed, the latest battle between free and expensive information started with a charitable gesture.
Brewster Kahle runs the Internet Archive, a venerable tech nonprofit. In that miserable, frightening first month of the COVID pandemic, he had the notion to try to help students, researchers and general readers. He unveiled the National Emergency Library, a vast trove of digital books mostly unavailable elsewhere, and made access to it a breeze.
This good deed backfired spectacularly. Four publishers claimed “willful mass copyright infringement” and sued. They won. On Friday, the publishers said through their trade association that they had negotiated a deal with the archive that would remove all their copyright books from the site.
“The proposed judgment is an appropriately serious bookend to the court’s decisive finding of liability,” said Maria Pallante, CEO of the Association of American Publishers. “We feel very good about it.”
The archive had a muted response, saying that it expected there would be changes to its lending program but that their full scope was unknown. There is also an undisclosed financial payment if the archive loses on appeal.
The case has generated a great deal of bitterness, and the deal, which requires court approval, is likely to generate more. Each side accuses the other of bad faith and calls its opponents well-funded zealots who won’t listen to reason and want to destroy the culture.
In the middle of this mess are writers, whose job is to produce the books that contain much of the world’s best information. Despite that central role, they are largely powerless — a familiar position for most writers. Emotions are running high.
Six thousand writers signed a petition supporting the lawsuit, and 1,000 names are on a petition denouncing it. The Romance Writers of America and the Western Writers of America joined a brief in favor of the publishers, while Authors Alliance, a group of 2,300 academics whose mission is to serve the public good by widely sharing their creations, submitted a brief for the archive.
It’s rarely this nasty, but free vs. expensive is a struggle that plays out continuously against all forms of media and entertainment. Neither side has the upper hand forever, even if it sometimes seems it might.
“The more information is free, the more opportunities for it to be collected, refined, packaged and made expensive,” said Stewart Brand, the technology visionary who developed the formulation. “The more it is expensive, the more workarounds to make it free. It’s a paradox. Each side makes the other true.”
A Cultural Tug of War
Universal access to all knowledge was a dream of the early internet. It’s an idea that Kahle (pronounced “kale”) has long championed. As the United States lurched to a halt in March 2020, he saw an opportunity. The Internet Archive would be a temporary bridge between beleaguered readers and the volumes shut away in libraries and schools.
It didn’t turn out that way, not a bit — the emergency library shut down in June 2020 — and three years later Kahle remained angry and frustrated. There was one bright spot. The San Francisco board of supervisors had just passed a resolution in support of digital libraries and the Internet Archive.
The resolution was largely symbolic, but the message was exactly the one that Kahle had been trying to get across without much success, particularly in court. It championed “the essential rights of all libraries to own, preserve and lend both digital and print books.”
“Libraries came before publishers,” Kahle, a 62-year-old librarian, said in a recent interview in the former Christian Science church in western San Francisco that houses the archive. “We came before copyright. But publishers now think of libraries as customer service departments for their database products.”
Librarians are custodians. Kahle has spent his career working in tech, but he wants the future to behave a little more like the past.
“If I pay you for an e-book, I should own that book,” he said. “Companies used to sell things. Media companies now rent them instead. It’s like they have tentacles. You pull the book off the shelf and say, ‘I think I’ll keep this,’ and then the tentacle yanks it back.”
Some necessary background: When a physical book is sold, the “first sale” provision of copyright law says the author and publisher have no control over that volume’s fate. It can be resold, and they don’t get a cut. It can be lent out as many times as readers demand. The information flows freely through society without leaving a trace. Religions and revolutions have been built on this.
E-books are treated differently. They can’t be resold or given away. A library that wants to lend e-books must buy a license from the copyright holder. These subscriptions can be limited to a number of reads, or by periods of a year or two. Everything is tracked. Libraries own nothing.
The Internet Archive’s lending program, developed long before the pandemic, involved scanning physical books and offering them to readers in its Open Library, a practice called controlled digital lending.
One reader at a time could borrow each scanned book. If the library or one of its partners had two copies, two readers at a time could borrow it. The archive defended making its own e-books by citing fair use, a broad legal concept that permits copyrighted material to be quoted and excerpted, and the first-sale doctrine: It could do what it wanted with its own books.
No dice, wrote Judge John G. Koeltl of U.S. District Court in Manhattan. His decision granting summary judgment for the publishers in March went far beyond the pandemic library. Any benefit for research and cultural participation, he said, was outweighed by harm to the publishers’ bottom line.
The Internet Archive lost its court battle at a moment of rising concern about whether tech, entertainment and media companies are up to the job of maintaining the public’s access to a wide-ranging culture. Warner Bros. Discovery, for example, wanted to scale back its Turner Classic Movies cable channel, a citadel of cinema history and art. It was stopped by an uproar.
New technology means culture is delivered on demand, but not all culture. When Netflix shipped DVDs to customers, there were about 100,000 to choose from. Streaming, which has different economics, has reduced that to about 6,600 U.S. titles. Most are contemporary. Only a handful of movies on Netflix were made between 1940 and 1970.
Libraries have traditionally been sanctuaries for culture that could not afford to pay its own way, or that was lost or buried or didn’t fit current tastes. That is at risk now.
“The permanence of library collections may become a thing of the past,” said Jason Schultz, director of New York University’s Technology Law & Policy Clinic. “If the platforms decide not to offer the e-books or publishers decide to pull them off the shelves, the reader loses out. This is similar to when songs you look for on Spotify are blanked out because the record company ended the license or when movies or television shows cycle off Netflix or Amazon.”
The triumphant publishers — HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, Hachette and John Wiley & Sons — declined to comment through the Association of American Publishers. In its “reflections” on the case, the publishers’ group said it was simply protecting the rights of writers.
“In the world of publishing, authors are our heroes,” it said.
The publishers association said the archive was unrepentant and impossible to negotiate with: It “refused to halt or engage in discussions, and after being sued, it chose to accelerate its activities.”
Kahle denied refusing to negotiate. “They never approached us; they just sued,” he said.
The Authors Guild, which submitted a brief on behalf of the publishers, said Kahle and his supporters needed to recognize that rights available to owners of physical books simply did not make sense in the digital era.
“Digital is different than print because it is infinitely copyable and unprotectable,” said Mary Rasenberger, the CEO of the guild and a copyright lawyer. “If anyone could call themselves a library, set up a website and do the exact same thing the archive did, writers would have absolutely no control over their work anymore.”
Traditional libraries promote discovery, but publishers perennially worry that they cost sales.
“Most publishers are not purely profit-driven,” Rasenberger said. “If one were, you could imagine it might not allow libraries to have e-books at all.”
Writers Caught in the Middle
The Internet Archive is best known for the Wayback Machine, which allows access to webpages of the past. Kahle is a longtime fixture in digital information circles.
He was an entrepreneur of information in the 1990s, culminating in a search and web analysis engine called Alexa, after the Library of Alexandria. Amazon bought Alexa in 1999 for $250 million, years before it introduced a personal assistant with the same name. Kahle turned his full attention to the archive, which he founded in 1996 and now employs about 100 people. It is supported by donations, grants and scanning for other libraries.
In 2021, when the archive celebrated its 25th anniversary, Kahle talked about the fate of the internet in an era of megacorporations: “Will this be our medium or will it be theirs? Will it be for a small controlling set of organizations or will it be a common good, a public resource?”
The archive had been lending book scans for years. Publishers did not like it but did not sue. What made the pandemic emergency library different was that the brakes were removed. If 10 people, or 100 people, wanted to read a particular book, they could all do so at once.
The emergency library “was as limited as a small city library’s circulation level,” Kahle insisted. “This was always under control.”
But it did not appear that way to the writers who took to Twitter to point out that the books in the library were written by humans who were often poorly paid and not benefiting from this free information.
Margaret Owen, an author of popular books for young adults, wrote in a 23-post broadside on Twitter that offering up free books to an audience that could afford to pay for them was, “at this point in history, cutting into our money for hospital and/or funeral bills.”
The publishers sued over 127 titles, many by well-known writers, including J.D. Salinger, Sylvia Plath, James Patterson, John Grisham and Malcolm Gladwell. They asked damages of $150,000 per book.
Some writers had second thoughts. N.K. Jemisin and Colson Whitehead deleted their critical tweets. Owen, asked last month by The New York Times if she stood by her tweets, responded by making her account private. Chuck Wendig, a science fiction writer, had tweeted that the emergency library was “piracy.” He was quoted in news reports and criticized by archive fans, and now has a post expressing regrets.
Wendig says he had no part in the lawsuit and does not support it. Three of the plaintiffs are his publishers, but they have “very little regard for me and do not listen to me at all,” he wrote in a blog post.
Some writers — ones who generally do not depend on their writing to make a living — were always against the suit.
“Authors of all types fight constantly against the risk of digital obscurity; for many readers, especially younger readers, if a book is not online, it effectively does not exist to them,” wrote Authors Alliance, which is based in Berkeley, California, in its brief in support of the archive. (Kahle is on the alliance’s 25-member advisory board but played no part in the brief.)
Other writers have continued and even deepened their opposition to the archive.
Douglas Preston, a bestselling thriller writer, led a wing of the writing community in opposition to Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, when the bookseller was embroiled in a dispute with Hachette several years ago. Preston, a former president of the Authors Guild, now sees Kahle as more of a threat than Bezos.
“Capitalists may be obnoxious and selfish and in firm need of restraint, but the truly dangerous people in this world are the true believers who want to impose their utopian vision on everyone else,” Preston said.
Writers, he added, “are subjected to disparagement and online abuse whenever we defend copyright or push back on the ‘Information wants to be free’ movement. On tech websites we’re told we’re selfish, we’re Luddites, we’re elitists.”
Information Wants to Be Easy
Among the many points on which the two sides disagree is how many libraries across the country were lending scans of copyrighted material. Only a few, say the publishers, who paint the Internet Archive as an outlier; many, says the archive, which argues this is a broad trend.
Karl Stutzman is the director of library services at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary in Elkhart, Indiana. He recently had a request from a faculty member for excerpts from a 30-year-old theology text to use in a class in Ethiopia, where the seminary has students. No e-book was available, and a query to the publisher went nowhere.
In the past, the library would have cited fair use and provided scans to the students via secure software, but after the March court ruling, Stutzman said, it’s unclear what is allowed. One chapter? Two? How many students can see a scan? Fifty? Five?
“I’m caught between enforcing the current legal paradigms around copyright and allowing my colleagues to have academic freedom in what they assign students to read,” Stutzman said. He plans to tell teachers that they need to choose material that is easy to license, even if it is not necessarily the best, until there is more legal clarity.
That clarity would come from an appeal, which Kahle said he intended to mount. In the meantime, the Open Library division still offers scans of many books under copyright.
Some of that is likely to change soon.
The agreement filed Friday went far beyond dropping the 127 titles from the archive to include “the full book catalogs” of the four plaintiffs. A separate deal will provide an incentive for the archive to take down works by any publisher that is a member of the trade group. The incentive: not getting sued again.
In a 1996 book available through the Internet Archive, David Bunnell, an early software chronicler of the personal computer revolution, said Kahle was “brilliant” but “very introspective and unsure of himself.”
“If he had Bill Gates’ confidence, he would change the world,” Bunnell said.
Kahle is more sure of himself now, and quite determined to change the world.
Asked if he had made any mistakes, he ignored the question and returned to the attack: “I wish the publishers had not sued, but it demonstrates how important it is that libraries stand firm on buying, preserving and lending the treasures that are books.”

As Hollywood Strikes Roll On, Viewers Have a Chance to Catch Up

With Hollywood’s labor disputes grinding on, and virtually all production stopped, anxiety began creeping into Zain Habboo’s house in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
She and her husband had recently finished the latest season of HBO’s “The Righteous Gemstones,” but now they were worried that new episodes of favorite shows like “The Handmaid’s Tale” would be significantly delayed.
What on earth were they going to watch?
Habboo, 49, quickly realized she had options. She might revisit classics like “30 Rock” and “Arrested Development” with her 17-year-old son. She could join him in watching a show he’s bingeing, like all 62 episodes of “Breaking Bad.” She has also never seen any of the “Mission Impossible” movies, and she has barely made a dent in the Oscar-nominated films from the past four or five years.
For many viewers, the writers’ and actors’ strikes in Hollywood will soon be felt in the form of altered film release schedules and prime-time lineups littered with game shows, reality TV and reruns.
At the same time, the pause in new scripted material provides a moment for many viewers to catch up after the breakneck pace of the so-called Peak TV era, when dozens of shows were premiering each month.
“I have a Netflix queue that is so deep and so long, it would take me months or a year or two to go through it all,” said Dan Leonhardt, a 44-year-old engineer who lives in Copenhagen, Denmark. “And that’s just Netflix! I also have a Max subscription.”
The slowdown will represent a major shift from recent years, when viewers were inundated with a fire hose of content — a record 599 new television scripted premieres last year.
On almost a daily basis, audiences found themselves clicking past new shows on their TVs, often ones they had never heard of, trying to figure out from a one-sentence description whether a series like “Altered Carbon” on Netflix or “The Path” on Hulu was worth their time.
For streaming services, the strategy was straightforward: The more shows they produced, the more chances they had to attract subscribers. The number of people who watched any one show wasn’t as important as the number of people who paid for the service.
So the promise of a constant flow of new stuff became a hallmark of the streaming era. One of the outstanding questions as the labor stalemate goes on has been whether viewers would start to cancel subscriptions to streaming services en masse when fewer new shows and movies became available.
For many, though, a slower output is just fine, giving them time to pick their way through streaming libraries, one missed TV series and movie at a time.
Emily Nidetz, a 41-year-old in Madison, Wisconsin, said she was relieved that production for reality series had not been affected and that there were still plenty of sports to watch. And though she is worried about a slowdown in prestige shows, she said she could always stop by a Facebook community page for The Ringer’s podcast “The Watch” to get some ideas.
“If you go to the Facebook page and write, ‘Hey, I really loved “The Bear,” tell me what to watch,’ there will be like 400 replies,” she said.
Tasha Quinn, a 36-year-old therapist from Chicago, said there was a moment last year when she was so overwhelmed by the conveyor belt of new series that she finally had to take a break. HBO’s “House of the Dragon” was the breaking point.
“I made it through two episodes, and didn’t finish it,” she said. “There was too much hype, and there were a lot of other things coming out at the same time. I was like, nope, I’m too overwhelmed, I’m too overstimulated, I’ll just go back to my comfort shows. I’m going to go watch ‘The Office.’”
Quinn said that the labor disputes had worried her briefly because new episodes of the dystopian workplace drama “Severance” on AppleTV+ would be delayed — but that she then quickly thought of the upside.
“I can take my time without everyone talking about what’s coming next,” she said, adding that she’s currently wrapping up “Succession.”
The length of the labor disputes will determine the length of the disruption. Actors have been on strike since July 14. Writers have been walking picket lines for more than 100 days. Formal talks between the writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, were held Friday for the first time since early May. No talks involving the actors are scheduled.
Third-party researchers believe that most of the streaming services should be well insulated if the strikes last another month or two — though that risk rises the longer production is shut down. The amount of content in their streaming libraries was one reason the studios initially said they could weather the strikes, at least in the short term, a pointed message to writers and actors currently going without paychecks. (For instance, “Suits,” a USA Network show that went off the air in 2019, has recently surged in popularity on Netflix.)
Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents thousands of striking screenwriters, recently said it was “disinformation” that the strike would have “no impact because streaming services have libraries and some product in the pipeline.”
“It is not a viable business strategy for these companies to shut down their business for three months — and counting — no matter how much they try and pretend it is,” they said in a note to members.
Many viewers say they support the striking writers and actors. Habboo said she believed they were not being fairly compensated, and “that is a huge bummer.”
Still, when asked if she would cut any of her streaming subscriptions, she was emphatic. “Don’t be ridiculous,” she said. “Canceling is never an option.”
Mel Russo, a 56-year-old yoga teacher who lives in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, said the Max service alone “could keep you busy for the next 10 years, to be honest.”
“I think it’s disgusting what’s going on,” she added. “But I am not in dire straits about it as a watcher and as a lover of entertainment.”
The streaming services seem keen to capitalize. Last month, Netflix rolled out a new banner, “10 Years of Netflix Series,” which presents viewers with dozens of older titles from its library.
Eric Martinez, a 25-year-old video producer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, had been a big fan of the HBO series “Euphoria.” But the earliest that show will return for its third season is now 2025, so he went looking for an alternative.
On his Amazon Prime page, Martinez had been seeing a tile for the show “The Boys” for some time. The superhero series was one he thought he had no interest in. But with time on his hands, he finally took the plunge. “I’m enjoying it, and I’m glad I started it,” he said.
Not all the viewers need a new old show to watch.
Brenda Stewart, a 71-year-old Nebraskan, said she and her husband often fired up their Roku and watched reruns of older series including “CSI” and “Murder, She Wrote.” She’s also a big fan of re-watching movies like “The Lion King” and other Disney classics.
Stewart, who has six grandchildren, said it was not uncommon to have “Bluey” episodes playing again and again in her house when the children were over. And, sometimes, it’s not exclusively for the little ones.
“It’s a cartoon series for kids, but I’m not going to lie — it’s also for adults,” she said, laughing. “There’s stuff in there that just makes me chuckle.”

Israeli Justices Poised to Rule On Their Fate: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The justices will be scrutinized as never before at a hearing in September on the first part of a judicial overhaul that the government pushed through Parliament, angering many Israelis.
For the first time in Israel's history, all 15 of its Supreme Court justices will crowd onto the bench on Sept. 12 to hear a case together. The reason: This one is so momentous that it could not only decide the powers of the court itself but also kindle a constitutional crisis.
The 15-member court -- which meets in a graceful building of beige stone, straight lines and arches on a hill in Jerusalem alongside Parliament -- includes secular liberals, religiously observant Jews and conservative residents of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. One justice is an Arab Israeli; six are women, including the court's president.
The justices will be scrutinized like never before as they begin hearing an appeal against the first part of a judicial overhaul that the government pushed through Parliament in July, angering many Israelis and stoking street protests across the country.
Many Israelis fear that the overhaul will weaken the court as a check on the government, currently the most right-wing and religiously conservative in Israeli history; accelerate a rightward shift of the judiciary that started almost a decade ago; and make it more politicized and less independent.
The government has primed itself for battle against the court by portraying it as a bastion of a secular, left-leaning elite and a closed club out of touch with changes sweeping the country. Experts say that characterization has not been true for years.
Ayelet Shaked, a former justice minister and right-wing politician, said the court was "very liberal and progressive" when she took office in 2015. But, she said in an interview, "I made it my goal to diversify the Supreme Court and make it more conservative, and that's what I did."
During her four-year term as justice minister, Ms. Shaked led the judicial selection committee and used her sway to reach deals with other members and bring in candidates of her choice. Now, she said of the court, "It is more balanced than before."
Michael Sfard, a human rights lawyer and political activist who has represented Israelis and Palestinians in the Supreme Court, agrees that the balance has shifted. The court is "much more right-wing, pro-settler and nationalist today than it was 20 years ago," he said.
With its judicial overhaul, the hard-line coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to shift that balance further to the right by having more control over the choice of the justices sitting on the Supreme Court and ultimately to grant less power to the judiciary and more to the elected government.
The hearing in September, during which the court will essentially be deciding whether to accept a curbing of its powers, heralds a potential showdown between the top judicial authority and the ruling coalition, and could fundamentally reshape Israeli democracy.
The court's president, Chief Justice Esther Hayut, prompted an uproar in January when she excoriated the government's judicial overhaul plan as an "unbridled attack on the judicial system" that would "deal a fatal blow" to its independence.
However, it is unclear how the court will rule because the judges are officially tasked with upholding the law and generally avoid making public statements on political issues.
Israeli human rights lawyers say that the court's rulings have become increasingly conservative. They point to decisions such as one from 2021 allowing colleges to offer gender-segregated courses to accommodate ultra-Orthodox students, in which the judges rejected the argument that the practice impinged on principles of equality.
Still, human rights groups say the court is an important backstop; this month, for example, the court indicated that it would intervene to ensure that an existing adoption law was not used to discriminate against same-sex couples.
"The court is still the only platform that defends human rights in Israel," said Noa Sattath, the executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, one of the groups that have petitioned the court to strike down the government's judicial legislation.
The court has become more transparent in the way it works, including livestreaming important hearings, said Tzipi Livni, who has twice served as justice minister. Nor does it operate like an old chums' network, she said in an interview, despite the claims of some members of the coalition.
"The government is complaining about things that existed decades ago and now don't," she added.
Often, the court walks a fine line between the demands of different segments of Israeli society and respect for government policy. It has long avoided explicitly ruling on the legality of Jewish settlement in the occupied territories, which Palestinians and most of the world consider a violation of international law. But the court has often slowed settlement growth by trying to protect the property rights of individual Palestinian landowners, irritating critics on the right.
Staunch liberals on the bench, such as Justice Uzi Vogelman, deputy president of the court, particularly annoyed a previous Netanyahu-led government by quashing a law in 2014 that would have allowed for lengthy incarceration of African migrants who had entered Israel illegally and ordering the release of all the detainees being held in a desert detention center.
Four out of six Supreme Court slots that opened up during the tenure of Ms. Shaked, the former justice minister, were filled by candidates she identified as conservatives, including Yael Willner, the first female justice to cover her hair in line with religious modesty rules. A fifth with conservative leanings was selected under a subsequent government in which Ms. Shaked served as interior minister and as a member of the committee that selects judges.
Noam Sohlberg, a West Bank settler, was the only overtly conservative justice sitting on the bench at the beginning of Ms. Shaked's tenure.
Though the court is now more ideologically diverse, significant parts of Israeli society remain underrepresented on the body, including Jews of Middle Eastern descent. There is just one Muslim justice, Khaled Kabub, from the Palestinian Arab minority that makes up 20 percent of Israel's population.
At the hearing on Sept. 12, the court is scheduled to hear multiple petitions by rights groups and individuals calling it to strike down the law passed by Parliament in July. That legislation cancels the court's ability to use the somewhat vague and subjective standard of reasonableness to overturn government decisions and appointments.
Critics of the government say that reasonableness is an essential tool for a court that is the only check on majority rule in a country with one house of Parliament, a figurehead president and no formal, written constitution. Even Justice Sohlberg, who has argued in favor of curtailing the use of the reasonableness standard, has balked at its being restricted by legislation.
By convening all 15 justices, experts say, Chief Justice Hayut cannot be accused of weighting the outcome by exclusion. A regular panel is composed of three justices, though they sometimes sit on expanded panels.
The case is particularly fraught because the Supreme Court, in making a decision on the law passed in July, will be ruling on an amendment to one of the Basic Laws that have quasi-constitutional status in Israel. The court has never intervened in a Basic Law before but says it has the right to do so. The government says it does not.
The battle over the judicial overhaul plan will probably be Chief Justice Hayut's last action before she ends her term. In mid-October she will turn 70, the mandatory retirement age for justices.
As she and other judges retire, at least four Supreme Court slots will open up over the next few years, and Yariv Levin, the current justice minister and a main architect of the overhaul, appears determined to give the government more say on the replacements. Mr. Netanyahu has confirmed that he will push ahead in the fall with a law to change the way that judges are selected.
Critics view that as the most polarizing piece of the overhaul, saying that it would politicize the court and essentially turn Israel into an autocracy.
For decades, the nine-member judicial selection committee has been made up of two government ministers, two lawmakers (usually one from the ruling coalition and one from the opposition), three Supreme Court justices and two lawyers from the Israel Bar Association, giving legal professionals an edge over the politicians. Supreme Court appointments require a special majority of seven.
Ms. Shaked said that judicial reform should be carried out only by consensus and that the damage wrought by the government's effort to push through the overhaul outweighed any benefits.
"I'd say, 'Use the existing system and get in one or two more conservatives without breaking the country apart,"' she said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech billionaire has become the dominant power in satellite internet technology. The ways he is wielding that influence are raising global alarms.
On March 17, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the leader of Ukraine's Armed Forces, dialed into a call to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Over the secure line, the two military leaders conferred on air defense systems, real-time battlefield assessments and shared intelligence on Russia's military losses.
They also talked about Elon Musk.
General Zaluzhnyi raised the topic of Starlink, the satellite internet technology made by Mr. Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, three people with knowledge of the conversation said. Ukraine's battlefield decisions depended on the continued use of Starlink for communications, General Zaluzhnyi said, and his country wanted to ensure access and discuss how to cover the cost of the service.
General Zaluzhnyi also asked if the United States had an assessment of Mr. Musk, who has sprawling business interests and murky politics -- to which American officials gave no answer.
Mr. Musk, who leads SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter, has become the most dominant player in space as he has steadily amassed power over the strategically significant field of satellite internet. Yet faced with little regulation and oversight, his erratic and personality-driven style has increasingly worried militaries and political leaders around the world, with the tech billionaire sometimes wielding his authority in unpredictable ways.
Since 2019, Mr. Musk has sent SpaceX rockets into space nearly every week that deliver dozens of sofa-size satellites into orbit. The satellites communicate with terminals on Earth, so they can beam high-speed internet to nearly every corner of the planet. Today, more than 4,500 Starlink satellites are in the skies, accounting for more than 50 percent of all active satellites. They have already started changing the complexion of the night sky, even before accounting for Mr. Musk's plans to have as many as 42,000 satellites in orbit in the coming years.
The power of the technology, which has helped push the value of closely held SpaceX to nearly $ 140 billion, is just beginning to be felt.
Starlink is often the only way to get internet access in war zones, remote areas and places hit by natural disasters. It is used in Ukraine for coordinating drone strikes and intelligence gathering. Activists in Iran and Turkey have sought to use the service as a hedge against government controls. The U.S. Defense Department is a big Starlink customer, while other militaries, such as in Japan, are testing the technology.
But Mr. Musk's near total control of satellite internet has raised alarms.
A combustible personality, the 52-year-old's allegiances are fuzzy. While Mr. Musk is hailed as a genius innovator, he alone can decide to shut down Starlink internet access for a customer or country, and he has the ability to leverage sensitive information that the service gathers. Such concerns have been heightened because no companies or governments have come close to matching what he has built.
In Ukraine, some fears have been realized. Mr. Musk has restricted Starlink access multiple times during the war, people familiar with the situation said. At one point, he denied the Ukrainian military's request to turn on Starlink near Crimea, the Russian-controlled territory, affecting battlefield strategy. Last year, he publicly floated a "peace plan" for the war that seemed aligned with Russian interests.
At times, Mr. Musk has openly flaunted Starlink's capabilities. "Between, Tesla, Starlink & Twitter, I may have more real-time global economic data in one head than anyone ever," he tweeted in April.
Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment. SpaceX declined to comment.
Worried about over-dependence on Mr. Musk's technology, Ukrainian officials have talked with other satellite internet providers, though they acknowledged none rival Starlink's reach.
"Starlink is indeed the blood of our entire communication infrastructure now," Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's digital minister, said in an interview.
At least nine countries -- including in Europe and the Middle East -- have also brought up Starlink with American officials over the past 18 months, with some questioning Mr. Musk's power over the technology, two U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the discussions said. Few nations will speak publicly about their concerns, for fear of alienating Mr. Musk, said intelligence and cybersecurity officials briefed on the conversations.
U.S. officials have said little publicly about Starlink as they balance domestic and geopolitical priorities related to Mr. Musk, who has criticized President Biden but whose technology is unavoidable.
The federal government is one of SpaceX's biggest customers, using its rockets for NASA missions and launching military surveillance satellites. Senior Pentagon officials have tried mediating issues involving Starlink, particularly Ukraine, a person familiar with the discussions said.
The Defense Department confirmed it contracts with Starlink, but it declined to elaborate, citing "the critical nature of these systems."
Other governments are wary. Taiwan, which has an internet infrastructure that could be vulnerable in the event of a Chinese invasion, is reluctant to use the service partly because of Mr. Musk's business links to China, Taiwanese and American officials said.
China has its own concerns. Mr. Musk said last year that Beijing sought assurances that he would not turn Starlink on inside the country, where the internet is controlled and censored by the state. In 2020, China registered with an international body to launch 13,000 internet satellites of its own.
The European Union, partly driven by misgivings about Starlink and Mr. Musk, also earmarked 2.4 billion euros, or $ 2.6 billion, last year to build a satellite constellation for civilian and military use.
"This is not just one company, but one person," said Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who co-founded the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank and has advised governments on satellite internet. "You are completely beholden to his whims and desires."
Reaching for the skies
Sir Martin Sweeting, a British engineer who founded the satellite design and manufacturing company Surrey Satellite Technology, was encouraged by a business associate in 2001 to meet with a "chap who wants to put a greenhouse on Mars." It turned out to be Mr. Musk.
Mr. Sweeting and Mr. Musk met soon after for breakfast at a space conference in Colorado, where the tech entrepreneur criticized NASA and talked about building a private space fleet.
"He was very focused," said Mr. Sweeting, whose company later received an investment from Mr. Musk and had him on its board of directors before it sold to Airbus in 2009.
Mr. Musk was also interested in an emerging field of research where small satellites are placed in the sky several hundred miles above sea level, an area known as "low-Earth orbit," Mr. Sweeting said.
Their work together was one of the earliest examples of Mr. Musk's focus on a technology that would help underpin Starlink. Satellites dating to the 1960s are typically bigger -- often the size of school buses -- and located higher in space, in what is known as "geosynchronous orbit," limiting their communication capabilities. Smaller satellites can orbit at a lower altitude, allowing them to link up with terminals on Earth to beam high-speed internet service to far-flung locations.
Many small satellites are necessary for this to work. That's because as one satellite moves above a Starlink terminal on land, it hands the internet signal to another satellite behind it to keep up a single, uninterrupted flow to users below.
Mr. Musk launched his first Starlink satellites into orbit in 2019. At the time, satellite internet was viewed as a fool's errand. In the 1990s and 2000s, other companies had pursued low-orbit communication satellites with little success because of the expense and technical difficulties of getting them into space.
But Mr. Musk had an advantage. SpaceX's rockets return to Earth after a trip to space and are partially reusable. This effectively gave him control of an express train to constantly deliver satellites to space, sometimes dozens at a time.
Now nearly every week, a SpaceX rocket loaded with Starlink satellites takes off from a site in California or Florida. Each satellite is designed to work for about three and a half years. There are so many in orbit that they are often mistaken for shooting stars. Astronomers have documented how the devices have interfered with research telescopes and warned about the risk of collisions.

"The night sky is one of the most glorious shows that nature puts on and humans are changing it forever," said Patrick Seitzer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan who studies orbital debris.
Starlink provides internet download speeds typically around 100 megabits per second, comparable to many landline services. SpaceX generally charges individual customers about $ 600 for each terminal that receives a connection from space, plus a monthly service fee of about $ 75, with costs higher for businesses and governments. The company knows the location, movement and altitude of each Starlink terminal, experts said.
The service, which officially debuted in 2021 in a handful of countries, is now available in more than 50 countries and territories, including the United States, Japan, much of Europe and parts of Latin America. In Africa, where internet access lags the rest of the world, Starlink is available in Nigeria, Mozambique and Rwanda, with more than a dozen other countries following by the end of 2024, according to Starlink's website.
"Everywhere on earth will have high bandwidth, low latency internet," Mr. Musk predicted on the Joe Rogan podcast in 2020.
Militaries, telecom companies, airlines, cruise lines and maritime shippers have flocked to Starlink, which has said it has more than 1.5 million subscribers.
Rivals have struggled, though competition is growing. OneWeb, a British company, was so plagued by financial difficulties that it had to be bailed out by the British government and sold to a group of investors. Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, who owns the rocket company Blue Origin, plans a Starlink competitor, Project Kuiper, but it has yet to get a satellite into space.
Lifeline on the battlefield
No event has demonstrated Starlink's power -- and Mr. Musk's influence -- more than the war in Ukraine.
More than 42,000 Starlink terminals are now used in Ukraine by the military, hospitals, businesses and aid organizations. During Russian bombing campaigns last year that caused widespread blackouts, Ukraine's public agencies turned to Starlink to stay online.


"Without Starlink, we cannot fly, we cannot communicate," said one Ukrainian deputy commander who goes by the nickname Zub, or Tooth, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.
Starlink entered Ukraine in February 2022, when Russia invaded and a cyberattack -- later attributed to Russia -- took down a satellite system run by the high-speed communications company Viasat that was being used by the Ukrainian military. With troops and commanders knocked offline, Mr. Fedorov, the digital minister, posted a plea to Mr. Musk for help.
Within hours, Mr. Musk contacted Mr. Fedorov to say that Starlink had been activated in Ukraine. Days later, Starlink terminals arrived.
The technology -- found in forests, fields, villages and mounted on the roofs of military vehicles -- has given Ukraine's army a major advantage over Russian forces. It has enabled artillery teams, commanders and pilots to watch drone footage simultaneously while chatting online. The response times from finding a target to hitting it have been cut to about a minute from nearly 20 minutes, soldiers said.
"The huge number of lives that Starlink has helped save can be measured in the thousands," Mr. Fedorov said.
But concerns among Ukrainian and Western officials about Mr. Musk's hold over the technology have grown, coming to a head last fall when he repeatedly made comments about the war that raised questions about his commitment to Starlink's service in Ukraine.
In September, at a private event on world and business affairs in Aspen, Colo., which was attended by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, Mr. Musk proposed a peace plan for Ukraine that included Russia annexing Ukrainian land. The proposal outraged many attendees.
Around this time, questions arose about who would pay for Starlink's service in Ukraine. SpaceX had initially covered some of the costs, with the United States and other allies also providing funding.
That same month, SpaceX told the U.S. Defense Department that it could not continue the arrangement and asked the Pentagon to take over funding. The company estimated the cost at nearly $ 400 million over 12 months, according to a SpaceX letter reported by CNN, which was verified by The New York Times.
The Biden administration directed a top Pentagon official, Colin H. Kahl, to mediate. On Oct. 7, Mr. Kahl called Mr. Musk, who expressed fears that Ukraine would use Starlink to not just defend itself, but also conduct offensive operations to regain territory seized by Russia, which could cause significant Russian military casualties, a former administration official said. Mr. Kahl told Mr. Musk more people in Ukraine would suffer if Starlink was shut down.
Mr. Musk nonetheless turned off access for some Starlink terminals in Ukraine. Late last year, about 1,300 Starlink terminals purchased through a British supplier stopped working in the country after the Ukrainian government could not pay the $ 2,500 monthly fee for each, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Starlink access also fluctuated depending on the movements of the war as Russia won territory and Ukraine fought to take it back. As the battle lines shifted, Mr. Musk used a process called geofencing to restrict where Starlink was available on the front lines. SpaceX uses location data gathered by its service to enforce geofencing limits.
This caused problems. When Ukrainian troops tried retaking cities like Kherson in Russian-controlled areas in the fall, they needed internet access to communicate. Mr. Fedorov and members of the armed forces messaged Mr. Musk and SpaceX employees requests to restore service in areas where the army was advancing.
Mr. Fedorov said SpaceX responded "very promptly."


Mr. Musk had other red lines that he would not cross. He refused Ukraine's request last year to provide Starlink access near Crimea, the Russian-controlled peninsula, so it could send an explosive-filled maritime drone into Russian ships docked in the Black Sea, two people familiar with the discussions said. Mr. Musk later said that Starlink could not be used for long-range drone strikes.
Other U.S. officials have weighed in. In June, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved a Pentagon deal to buy 400 to 500 new Starlink terminals and services. The deal gives the Pentagon control of setting where Starlink's internet signal works inside Ukraine for those new devices to carry out "key capabilities and certain missions," two people familiar with the deal said. This appeared intended to provide Ukraine with dedicated terminals and services to conduct sensitive functions without fear of interruption.
Unlike traditional defense contractors, whose weapon sales to foreign countries are typically done through the federal government, Starlink is a commercial product. That allows Mr. Musk to act in ways that sometimes do not align with U.S. interests, such as when SpaceX said it could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, said Gregory C. Allen, a former Defense Department official who worked at Blue Origin.
"It has certainly been a long time since we've seen a company and an individual like this go pretty openly against U.S. foreign policy in the middle of a war," said Mr. Allen, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Mr. Musk's behavior has divided Ukrainian officials. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Twitter in February that SpaceX needed to pick a side.
But Mr. Fedorov said questions about Mr. Musk's commitment were unfair. When Ukraine was under heavy bombardment and facing major power outages in November, Mr. Musk helped expedite the delivery of about 10,000 Starlink terminals, he said.
"SpaceX and Elon Musk have shown through their deeds whose side they are actually on," Mr. Fedorov said.
From Taiwan to Turkey
In February, two undersea internet cables running between Taiwan's main island and the outlying islands of Matsu were severed by Chinese shipping vessels. The incident interrupted online access across Matsu, intensifying concerns that Taiwan's communications infrastructure was vulnerable.
Taiwan, which China has claimed as its own territory, would seem to be an ideal place to bring in Starlink. But Taiwan was reluctant -- a concern increasingly echoed elsewhere as governments weigh the power of satellite internet against the risks of working with Mr. Musk.
Taiwanese officials had spoken with SpaceX about Starlink, said Jason Hsu, a former Taiwan legislator who advises the government on digital infrastructure. But talks slowed partly because of "tremendous concerns" about Mr. Musk, whose financial interests are tied to China, he said. With roughly 50 percent of new Tesla cars estimated to be manufactured in Shanghai, Taiwan did not trust Mr. Musk to provide Starlink access if Beijing applied pressure to turn off the service, he added.
"We worry that if we order devices from Starlink, we'll fall into some sort of trap," said Mr. Hsu, now a senior research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School in Taipei. "Elon has huge commercial interests in China."
When a U.S. congressional delegation visited Taiwan in April, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, a Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, asked the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, during a lunch about potentially using Starlink, according to committee staff on the trip. Ms. Tsai was noncommittal. Congressional aides concluded soon after that the service was not a viable option for Taiwan because of Mr. Musk's links to China, the committee staff said.
Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, said the country struck a deal with OneWeb in June and had not ruled out working with any satellite provider. "We want to test as many constellations as possible," she said.
Mr. Musk's influence has been debated elsewhere. In the European Union, concerns about Starlink's dominance influenced the 27-nation bloc to set aside 2.4 billion euros last year for a "sovereign" satellite constellation, to launch as soon as 2027.
"Space has become a highly contested domain where the European Union must safeguard its vital interests," said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner overseeing the project. "The E.U. cannot afford to be reliant on others."
To address government needs, SpaceX last year introduced a Starlink-related service, Starshield, that offered stronger security for handling classified material and processing sensitive data.
Starlink also faces criticism from more authoritarian governments.
When anti-government protests broke out in Iran last year, Mr. Musk made Starlink available there to help activists stay online. The Iranian government accused SpaceX of violating its sovereignty.
China complained this year to a United Nations panel that SpaceX was putting so many satellites into orbit that it would prevent others from accessing space. In February, Turkey refused Mr. Musk's offer to provide Starlink access after a major earthquake, which civil society groups viewed as an effort to prevent unfavorable news from spreading online.
"The government was afraid that Starlink is not under its control, and could represent a threat," said Chérif El Kadhi, a policy analyst tracking Turkey for Access Now, a digital rights organization.
Mr. Musk's dominance in space is unlikely to be equaled any time soon. In May, Amazon prepared to put its first two satellites into orbit, but the launch was put on hold after a problem was discovered in rocket testing.
Since then, Mr. Musk has sent at least 595 more Starlink satellites into space.

Full text: The presidential candidate who was assassinated on Wednesday had a long history in Ecuador's public affairs, largely as an antagonist to those in power.
Union leader. Muckraking journalist. Legislator. Presidential candidate. And, now, assassin's victim.
Fernando Villavicencio, who was gunned down at a rally on Wednesday, had a long history in Ecuadorean public affairs, largely as an antagonist to those in power. He rose to prominence as a union leader at the state oil company, Petroecuador, and later played a crucial role in exposing a bribery scandal that eventually led to the conviction of former President Rafael Correa.
Mr. Correa, a socialist, led the nation for a decade through 2017, the longest continuous tenure of a democratically elected president in Ecuador. A commodities boom helped him lift millions out of poverty, but his authoritarian style and the corruption allegations that trailed him deeply divided the country
And Mr. Villavicencio was "always contesting the power" of Mr. Correa, according to Caroline Ávila, an Ecuadorean political analyst.
He held "a prominent place among the activists of the social movements in Ecuador," said Mauricio Alarcón Salvador, the director of Transparency International's chapter in Ecuador.
For two decades, Mr. Villavicencio worked in investigative journalism, with a focus on corruption in the oil sector. "This among many other things provoked the rage, the anger of those in power," said Mr. Alarcón.
Born in a small town in the central province of Chimborazo to a poor family, he moved to Quito as a teenager to complete high school through night classes, said Juan Carlos Calderón, director of the investigative news organization Plan V and a university classmate and journalistic collaborator of Mr. Villavicencio's.
His classmates at the Central University of Ecuador described him, then a journalism student, as an ardent leftist and an excellent debater.
"I always saw him as a very courageous person, very powerful in everything he undertook," said Mr. Calderón. "He never really stopped being that way."
As a journalist, Mr. Villavicencio obtained documents about a government surveillance program that he sent to WikiLeaks but eventually published himself. Some of his work led to death threats and charges that were widely criticized as politically motivated.
He worked alongside the politician Clever Jiménez and the activist Carlos Figueroa, who was with him at the campaign rally where he was shot.
Mr. Correa unleashed "an unprecedented judicial persecution" against the three, and particularly against Mr. Villavicencio, said Mr. Alarcón, who served as his lawyer before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which granted them precautionary protection measures. The persecution included raiding their homes on Christmas Eve and threatening their families, he added.
"This is also a sign that Villavicencio's work permanently touched sensitive fibers" that "before were believed to be untouchable," he said.
In 2014, Mr. Villavicencio sought refuge for several months with the Indigenous Sarayaku community in the Amazon after he was sentenced to prison for insulting Mr. Correa. He also spent six months in hiding in 2017 before seeking political asylum in Peru.
There, he met with a friend from his undergraduate days at the Central University of Ecuador. He had no money to fight the charges against him, and had been forced to leave behind his two young children.
"He felt bullied and diminished," said the friend, Grace Jaramillo, who is now a political scientist at the University of British Columbia.
But later that year, Mr. Correa left office, and Mr. Villavicencio returned home. A federal court declared him innocent, and he continued to publish corruption investigations and to file complaints with the Ecuadorean attorney general, many of which were corroborated.
He was sometimes criticized for mixing his roles as journalist and activist, and even Mr. Calderón disagreed with his decisions to file complaints with the attorney general.
"I always considered that one is a journalist, period. Not a prosecutor or whistle-blower," he said.
But he said Mr. Villavicencio "had this idea that being a journalist was not enough; it was not enough to expose. He considered it important to take even further action so that there wouldn't be impunity."
That determination led him to move definitively into politics, and in 2021 he won a seat in the National Assembly, where he served until May, when the legislature was dissolved by President Guillermo Lasso, who was facing impeachment proceedings over embezzlement accusations.
Mr. Lasso's move also triggered a presidential election, with a vote set for Aug. 20. For his presidential run, Mr. Villavicencio, 59, cast himself as the anticorruption candidate. He was representing the Build Ecuador Movement, a broad coalition, and campaigned on issues like personal safety in a country that has been consumed by violence related to narco-trafficking.
He was outspoken about links between city governments and drug-trafficking money, which earned him enemies, said Mr. Calderón.
"I always thought that he was a trade unionist at heart, wasn't he?" he said. "And he took that spirit to the campaign."
Mr. Villavicencio was polling near the middle of an eight-person race, but remained hopeful about his chances, according to Ms. Jaramillo. But he was gunned down before voters could deliver their verdict.
The last time Mr. Calderón spoke to the presidential candidate was on Tuesday, the day before he died. When he found out about the killing, he and other friends rushed to the hospital, where they stayed until Mr. Villavicencio's body was moved to the morgue.
"We knew he was threatened; we thought he was protected," he said. "You don't think that this could happen to someone very close to you."
Soon after the killing, Mr. Correa issued a lament on social media.
"They have assassinated Fernando Villavicencio," he wrote. "Ecuador has become a failed state."

Elon Musk’s Unmatched Power in the Stars

Full text: Enlarge this image.
On March 17, Gen. Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the leader of Ukraine’s armed forces, dialed into a call to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Over the secure line, the two military leaders conferred on air defense systems, real-time battlefield assessments and shared intelligence on Russia’s military losses.
They also talked about Elon Musk.
Zaluzhnyi raised the topic of Starlink, the satellite internet technology made by Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, three people with knowledge of the conversation said. Ukraine’s battlefield decisions depended on the continued use of Starlink for communications, Zaluzhnyi said, and his country wanted to ensure access and discuss how to cover the cost of the service.
Zaluzhnyi also asked if the United States had an assessment of Musk, who has sprawling business interests and murky politics — to which U.S. officials gave no answer.
Musk, who leads SpaceX, Tesla and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, has become the most dominant player in space as he has steadily amassed power over the strategically significant field of satellite internet. Yet faced with little regulation and oversight, his erratic and personality-driven style has increasingly worried militaries and political leaders around the world, with the tech billionaire sometimes wielding his authority in unpredictable ways.
Since 2019, Musk has sent SpaceX rockets into space nearly every week that deliver dozens of sofa-size satellites into orbit. The satellites communicate with terminals on Earth, so they can beam high-speed internet to nearly every corner of the planet. Today, more than 4,500 Starlink satellites are in the skies, accounting for more than 50% of all active satellites. They have already started changing the complexion of the night sky, even before accounting for Musk’s plans to have as many as 42,000 satellites in orbit in the coming years.
The power of the technology, which has helped push the value of closely held SpaceX to nearly $140 billion, is just beginning to be felt.
Starlink is often the only way to get internet access in war zones, remote areas and places hit by natural disasters. It is used in Ukraine for coordinating drone strikes and intelligence gathering. Activists in Iran and Turkey have sought to use the service as a hedge against government controls. The U.S. Defense Department is a big Starlink customer, while other militaries, such as in Japan, are testing the technology.
But Musk’s near total control of satellite internet has raised alarms.
A combustible personality, the 52-year-old’s allegiances are fuzzy. While Musk is hailed as a genius innovator, he alone can decide to shut down Starlink internet access for a customer or country, and he has the ability to leverage sensitive information that the service gathers. Such concerns have been heightened because no companies or governments have come close to matching what he has built.
In Ukraine, some fears have been realized. Musk has restricted Starlink access multiple times during the war, people familiar with the situation said. At one point, he denied the Ukrainian military’s request to turn on Starlink near Crimea, the Russian-controlled territory, affecting battlefield strategy. Last year, he publicly floated a “peace plan” for the war that seemed aligned with Russian interests.
At times, Musk has openly flaunted Starlink’s capabilities. “Between, Tesla, Starlink & Twitter, I may have more real-time global economic data in one head than anyone ever,” he tweeted in April.
Musk did not respond to requests for comment. SpaceX declined to comment.
Worried about overdependence on Musk’s technology, Ukrainian officials have talked with other satellite internet providers, though they acknowledged none rival Starlink’s reach.
“Starlink is indeed the blood of our entire communication infrastructure now,” Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s digital minister, said in an interview.
At least nine countries — including in Europe and the Middle East — have also brought up Starlink with U.S. officials over the past 18 months, with some questioning Musk’s power over the technology, two U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the discussions said. Few nations will speak publicly about their concerns, for fear of alienating Musk, said intelligence and cybersecurity officials briefed on the conversations.
U.S. officials have said little publicly about Starlink as they balance domestic and geopolitical priorities related to Musk, who has criticized President Joe Biden but whose technology is unavoidable.
The federal government is one of SpaceX’s biggest customers, using its rockets for NASA missions and launching military surveillance satellites. Senior Pentagon officials have tried mediating issues involving Starlink, particularly Ukraine, a person familiar with the discussions said.
The Defense Department confirmed it contracts with Starlink, but it declined to elaborate, citing “the critical nature of these systems.”
Other governments are wary. Taiwan, which has an internet infrastructure that could be vulnerable in the event of a Chinese invasion, is reluctant to use the service partly because of Musk’s business links to China, Taiwanese and U.S. officials said.
China has its own concerns. Musk said last year that Beijing sought assurances that he would not turn Starlink on inside the country, where the internet is controlled and censored by the state. In 2020, China registered with an international body to launch 13,000 internet satellites of its own.
The European Union, partly driven by misgivings about Starlink and Musk, also earmarked 2.4 billion euros, or $2.6 billion, last year to build a satellite constellation for civilian and military use.
“This is not just one company, but one person,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who co-founded the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank and has advised governments on satellite internet. “You are completely beholden to his whims and desires.”
Reaching for the Skies
Sir Martin Sweeting, a British engineer who founded the satellite design and manufacturing company Surrey Satellite Technology, was encouraged by a business associate in 2001 to meet with a “chap who wants to put a greenhouse on Mars.” It turned out to be Musk.
Sweeting and Musk met soon after for breakfast at a space conference in Colorado, where the tech entrepreneur criticized NASA and talked about building a private space fleet.
“He was very focused,” said Sweeting, whose company later received an investment from Musk and had him on its board of directors before it sold to Airbus in 2009.
Musk was also interested in an emerging field of research where small satellites are placed in the sky several hundred miles above sea level, an area known as “low-Earth orbit,” Sweeting said.
Their work together was one of the earliest examples of Musk’s focus on a technology that would help underpin Starlink. Satellites dating to the 1960s are typically bigger — often the size of school buses — and located higher in space, in what is known as “geosynchronous orbit,” limiting their communication capabilities. Smaller satellites can orbit at a lower altitude, allowing them to link up with terminals on Earth to beam high-speed internet service to far-flung locations.
Many small satellites are necessary for this to work. That’s because as one satellite moves above a Starlink terminal on land, it hands the internet signal to another satellite behind it to keep up a single, uninterrupted flow to users below.
Musk launched his first Starlink satellites into orbit in 2019. At the time, satellite internet was viewed as a fool’s errand. In the 1990s and 2000s, other companies had pursued low-orbit communication satellites with little success because of the expense and technical difficulties of getting them into space.
But Musk had an advantage. SpaceX’s rockets return to Earth after a trip to space and are partially reusable. This effectively gave him control of an express train to constantly deliver satellites to space, sometimes dozens at a time.
Now nearly every week, a SpaceX rocket loaded with Starlink satellites takes off from a site in California or Florida. Each satellite is designed to work for about 3 1/2 years. There are so many in orbit that they are often mistaken for shooting stars. Astronomers have documented how the devices have interfered with research telescopes and warned about the risk of collisions.
“The night sky is one of the most glorious shows that nature puts on and humans are changing it forever,” said Patrick Seitzer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan who studies orbital debris.
Starlink provides internet download speeds typically around 100 megabits per second, comparable to many landline services. SpaceX generally charges individual customers about $600 for each terminal that receives a connection from space, plus a monthly service fee of about $75, with costs higher for businesses and governments. The company knows the location, movement and altitude of each Starlink terminal, experts said.
The service, which officially debuted in 2021 in a handful of countries, is now available in more than 50 countries and territories, including the United States, Japan, much of Europe and parts of Latin America. In Africa, where internet access lags the rest of the world, Starlink is available in Nigeria, Mozambique and Rwanda, with more than a dozen other countries following by the end of 2024, according to Starlink’s website.
“Everywhere on Earth will have high bandwidth, low latency internet,” Musk predicted on the Joe Rogan podcast in 2020.
Militaries, telecom companies, airlines, cruise lines and maritime shippers have flocked to Starlink, which has said it has more than 1.5 million subscribers.
Rivals have struggled, though competition is growing. OneWeb, a British company, was so plagued by financial difficulties that it had to be bailed out by the British government and sold to a group of investors. Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, who owns the rocket company Blue Origin, plans a Starlink competitor, Project Kuiper, but it has yet to get a satellite into space.
Lifeline on the Battlefield
No event has demonstrated Starlink’s power — and Musk’s influence — more than the war in Ukraine.
More than 42,000 Starlink terminals are now used in Ukraine by the military, hospitals, businesses and aid organizations. During Russian bombing campaigns last year that caused widespread blackouts, Ukraine’s public agencies turned to Starlink to stay online.
“Without Starlink, we cannot fly, we cannot communicate,” said one Ukrainian deputy commander who goes by the nickname Zub, or Tooth, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.
Starlink entered Ukraine in February 2022, when Russia invaded and a cyberattack — later attributed to Russia — took down a satellite system run by the high-speed communications company Viasat that was being used by the Ukrainian military. With troops and commanders knocked offline, Fedorov, the digital minister, posted a plea to Musk for help.
Within hours, Musk contacted Fedorov to say that Starlink had been activated in Ukraine. Days later, Starlink terminals arrived.
The technology — found in forests, fields, villages and mounted on the roofs of military vehicles — has given Ukraine’s army a major advantage over Russian forces. It has enabled artillery teams, commanders and pilots to watch drone footage simultaneously while chatting online. The response times from finding a target to hitting it have been cut to about a minute from nearly 20 minutes, soldiers said.
“The huge number of lives that Starlink has helped save can be measured in the thousands,” Fedorov said.
But concerns among Ukrainian and Western officials about Musk’s hold over the technology have grown, coming to a head last fall when he repeatedly made comments about the war that raised questions about his commitment to Starlink’s service in Ukraine.
In September, at a private event on world and business affairs in Aspen, Colorado, which was attended by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, Musk proposed a peace plan for Ukraine that included Russia annexing Ukrainian land. The proposal outraged many attendees.
Around this time, questions arose about who would pay for Starlink’s service in Ukraine. SpaceX had initially covered some of the costs, with the United States and other allies also providing funding.
That same month, SpaceX told the U.S. Defense Department that it could not continue the arrangement and asked the Pentagon to take over funding. The company estimated the cost at nearly $400 million over 12 months, according to a SpaceX letter reported by CNN, which was verified by The New York Times.
The Biden administration directed a top Pentagon official, Colin H. Kahl, to mediate. On Oct. 7, Kahl called Musk, who expressed fears that Ukraine would use Starlink to not just defend itself, but also conduct offensive operations to regain territory seized by Russia, which could cause significant Russian military casualties, a former administration official said. Kahl told Musk more people in Ukraine would suffer if Starlink was shut down.
Musk nonetheless turned off access for some Starlink terminals in Ukraine. Late last year, about 1,300 Starlink terminals purchased through a British supplier stopped working in the country after the Ukrainian government could not pay the $2,500 monthly fee for each, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Starlink access also fluctuated depending on the movements of the war as Russia won territory and Ukraine fought to take it back. As the battle lines shifted, Musk used a process called geofencing to restrict where Starlink was available on the front lines. SpaceX uses location data gathered by its service to enforce geofencing limits.
This caused problems. When Ukrainian troops tried retaking cities like Kherson in Russian-controlled areas in the fall, they needed internet access to communicate. Fedorov and members of the armed forces messaged Musk and SpaceX employees requests to restore service in areas where the army was advancing.
Fedorov said SpaceX responded “very promptly.”Musk had other red lines that he would not cross. He refused Ukraine’s request last year to provide Starlink access near Crimea, the Russian-controlled peninsula, so it could send an explosive-filled maritime drone into Russian ships docked in the Black Sea, two people familiar with the discussions said. Musk later said that Starlink could not be used for long-range drone strikes.
Other U.S. officials have weighed in. In June, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved a Pentagon deal to buy 400 to 500 new Starlink terminals and services. The deal gives the Pentagon control of setting where Starlink’s internet signal works inside Ukraine for those new devices to carry out “key capabilities and certain missions,” two people familiar with the deal said. This appeared intended to provide Ukraine with dedicated terminals and services to conduct sensitive functions without fear of interruption.
Unlike traditional defense contractors, whose weapon sales to foreign countries are typically done through the federal government, Starlink is a commercial product. That allows Musk to act in ways that sometimes do not align with U.S. interests, such as when SpaceX said it could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, said Gregory C. Allen, a former Defense Department official who worked at Blue Origin.
“It has certainly been a long time since we’ve seen a company and an individual like this go pretty openly against U.S. foreign policy in the middle of a war,” said Allen, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Musk’s behavior has divided Ukrainian officials. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Twitter in February that SpaceX needed to pick a side.
But Fedorov said questions about Musk’s commitment were unfair. When Ukraine was under heavy bombardment and facing major power outages in November, Musk helped expedite the delivery of about 10,000 Starlink terminals, he said.
“SpaceX and Elon Musk have shown through their deeds whose side they are actually on,” Fedorov said.
From Taiwan to Turkey
In February, two undersea internet cables running between Taiwan’s main island and the outlying islands of Matsu were severed by Chinese shipping vessels. The incident interrupted online access across Matsu, intensifying concerns that Taiwan’s communications infrastructure was vulnerable.
Taiwan, which China has claimed as its own territory, would seem to be an ideal place to bring in Starlink. But Taiwan was reluctant — a concern increasingly echoed elsewhere as governments weigh the power of satellite internet against the risks of working with Musk.
Taiwanese officials had spoken with SpaceX about Starlink, said Jason Hsu, a former Taiwan legislator who advises the government on digital infrastructure. But talks slowed partly because of “tremendous concerns” about Musk, whose financial interests are tied to China, he said. With roughly 50% of new Tesla cars estimated to be manufactured in Shanghai, Taiwan did not trust Musk to provide Starlink access if Beijing applied pressure to turn off the service, he added.
“We worry that if we order devices from Starlink, we’ll fall into some sort of trap,” said Hsu, now a senior research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School in Taipei, Taiwan. “Elon has huge commercial interests in China.”
When a U.S. congressional delegation visited Taiwan in April, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, asked the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, during a lunch about potentially using Starlink, according to committee staff on the trip. Tsai was noncommittal. Congressional aides concluded soon after that the service was not a viable option for Taiwan because of Musk’s links to China, the committee staff said.
Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister, said the country struck a deal with OneWeb in June and had not ruled out working with any satellite provider. “We want to test as many constellations as possible,” she said.
Musk’s influence has been debated elsewhere. In the European Union, concerns about Starlink’s dominance influenced the 27-nation bloc to set aside 2.4 billion euros last year for a “sovereign” satellite constellation, to launch as soon as 2027.
“Space has become a highly contested domain where the European Union must safeguard its vital interests,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner overseeing the project. “The EU cannot afford to be reliant on others.”
To address government needs, SpaceX last year introduced a Starlink-related service, Starshield, that offered stronger security for handling classified material and processing sensitive data.
Starlink also faces criticism from more authoritarian governments.
When anti-government protests broke out in Iran last year, Musk made Starlink available there to help activists stay online. The Iranian government accused SpaceX of violating its sovereignty.
China complained this year to a U.N. panel that SpaceX was putting so many satellites into orbit that it would prevent others from accessing space. In February, Turkey refused Musk’s offer to provide Starlink access after a major earthquake, which civil society groups viewed as an effort to prevent unfavorable news from spreading online.
“The government was afraid that Starlink is not under its control, and could represent a threat,” said Chérif El Kadhi, a policy analyst tracking Turkey for Access Now, a digital rights organization.
Musk’s dominance in space is unlikely to be equaled any time soon. In May, Amazon prepared to put its first two satellites into orbit, but the launch was put on hold after a problem was discovered in rocket testing. Since then, Musk has sent at least 595 more Starlink satellites into space.

High Costs Slow Offshore Wind Projects: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some troubled projects are raising concerns about the role to be played by offshore wind farms in tackling climate change.
Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, has for years been doing preliminary work for what would be one of the world's largest offshore wind complexes, in the North Sea off eastern England.
Now, there are questions about whether this project will ever be built. Last month, Vattenfall said it would halt the first of three phases of the wind farm complex, the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, which is projected to provide power for about four million homes in Britain.
Vattenfall blamed rapidly escalating costs for equipment and construction expenses, which it said had climbed as much as 40 percent over the past few quarters. The estimated price tag for the three phases has risen to 13 billion pounds, or about $ 16.6 billion, from £10 billion.
"With the new market conditions, it simply doesn't make sense to continue the project," Helene Bistrom, head of business area wind at Vattenfall, said during a video presentation. The decision led Vattenfall, which the Swedish government owns, to write down more than $ 500 million.
Vattenfall's pullback added to the widespread alarm unfolding across the offshore industry about rapidly increasing costs, due partly to supply chain issues and rising demand.
In recent months, several developers in the United States have sought to renegotiate power supply contracts, scrapping them in at least one case, and Orsted, a Danish company that is the world's largest offshore wind developer, warned that a major project in Britain, Hornsea 3, could be "at risk" without more government support.
With interest rates shooting up, financing the billions of dollars in investment that go into these installations has also become far more expensive.
On Monday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy reported a net loss of 2.9 billion euros ( $ 3.2 billion) for the April-to-June quarter, largely due to problems tied to "increased product costs and ramp-up challenges" in its offshore energy business.
"There's very few projects that are immune to the inflationary impact," said Finlay Clark, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm.
Rising costs for wind developers are a problem for governments in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Many countries are counting on an enormous and rapid expansion of offshore wind to achieve a significant portion of their renewable energy goals.
"We are wasting time here," Morten Dyrholm, group senior vice president for corporate affairs at Vestas Wind Systems, the Danish turbine maker, said of the industry's problems. "We need to grow the sector quite dramatically."
Mr. Dyrholm and others in the industry say the inflation problems are a warning sign that governments need to change their system of awarding offshore wind licenses.
The procedures for obtaining the rights to build wind farms vary in different countries but often involve an auction of seabed leases followed, sometimes years later, by agreements that set the price paid by power companies for the electricity generated.
These arrangements, designed to drive down power prices for consumers and, often, to maximize revenues from lease sales, should be broadened to take into account other factors, some industry leaders say. An auction for seabed rights awarded by Scotland in 2022 is cited as a model because it put greater emphasis on factors like the ability of wind companies to develop suppliers, and the experience of the companies.
The debate could open the way for more power deals with corporations like Amazon and Microsoft, whose data centers are hungry consumers of electricity. Large businesses might be more flexible partners for wind developers than government officials who tend to say, "This is the rule," said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utilities analyst at Bernstein, a research firm.
Renewable energy programs like Britain's -- which is designed to encourage financial backing by providing a guaranteed price to wind developers, and to gradually drive down charges paid by consumers -- attracted billions in investment when inflation was low. Now, in a very different world, after the disruptions of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Britain is taking fire for policies that could make wind projects uneconomical.
"I am afraid the U.K. has gone from being one of the best governments in Europe on offshore wind to one of the worst," said Giles Dickson, chief executive of WindEurope, a trade body.
A British government spokesman responded: "We understand there are supply chain pressures for the sector globally, not just in the U.K., and we are listening to companies' concerns."
The inflation problems are mainly hitting offshore wind farms in late stages of development rather than those already generating power.
Offshore projects can require a decade to progress from planning stages to generating power. That means agreements on issues like the power price may be years old before the turbines are in place and generating electricity.
That system worked when inflation was negligible and demand for turbines and other equipment was relatively subdued. Now, as a growing number of developers look to secure everything necessary to undertake the projects -- from wind turbines, which cost millions of dollars, to the services of specialized construction ships, to bank financing -- they discover that the price tags have suddenly soared. Mr. Dyrholm estimates that prices of wind turbines alone have increased 30 percent in the past year.
"The costs have risen, and you have a mismatch," said Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP, which is an investor, with Equinor, a Norwegian company, in three offshore wind projects in the Atlantic that would supply power to around two million households in New York State. Equinor and BP have petitioned state authorities to renegotiate their power contracts.
Similarly, developers in Britain and elsewhere don't seem to want to completely jettison projects. Many are trying to renegotiate the deals or push governments to alter the formats of future auctions. Some are terminating existing contracts to supply power to utilities and seeking new ones -- or threatening such moves, figuring there will be plenty of demand for clean power in the future.
Walking away from contracts signed years ago has become "the prudent commercial course" even with the risk of financial penalties, SouthCoast Wind, a project part-owned by Shell that would be located in the Atlantic near Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, said in a statement in June.
Another Massachusetts proposal, Commonwealth Wind, which is owned by Avangrid, a U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, has terminated its power supply contract and plans to seek a new deal in a future auction, the company said.
"The economics are challenging," said Stephanie McClellan, executive director of Turn Forward, an offshore wind advocacy organization in the United States.
Despite the soured deals, interest in offshore wind remains strong. In a recent auction in Germany, BP and TotalEnergies in France agreed to pay around $ 14 billion over three decades for offshore tracts.
The German deals differ from others because the companies are simply paying for the rights to develop sea bottom, and they will negotiate what they are paid for the electricity at a later date.
Such deals are attractive to a corporate giant like BP, which has the financial firepower to make them happen and would be freer to do what it wants with the power. Mr. Looney said he hoped to steer away from the long-term power contracts, preferring instead to try to squeeze more value from wind-generated electricity by using it to make green hydrogen, a still scarce clean fuel, or charge electric vehicles.
"We'd like to do something with those electrons -- take them and put them to use," he said.
But there are only a handful of companies with the heft of BP and TotalEnergies. Whether nations can achieve their offshore ambitions through such commercial deals remains to be seen. Critics say charging high prices for leases will lead to higher power prices for consumers.

Even Zoom Is Returning To the Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech company that helped millions of people work from home is finally tired of its employees being far away. It's not the only one that feels that way.
During the early months of the pandemic, a certain company went suddenly from relative obscurity to the type of popularity that made it a noun, verb and catchphrase.
"Can you set up a Zoom for us?"
"Let's just Zoom."
"I have Zoom fatigue."
Revenue for the video conferencing company soared in 2020 -- a jump driven by the millions of people who started working from home. Zoom was also part of the remote work shift that it powered, with most of its employees permitted to work from home.
But now, joining a swell of other tech firms pushing for in-person work, Zoom is requiring many of its 7,400 employees to start showing up at the office.
The company last week asked all employees within 50 miles of an office to work in person on a part-time basis, a plan Zoom said it would roll out in August and September.
"We believe that a structured hybrid approach -- meaning employees that live near an office need to be on site two days a week to interact with their teams -- is most effective for Zoom," a company spokesperson said. "We'll continue to leverage the entire Zoom platform to keep our employees and dispersed teams connected and working efficiently."
During a tense meeting last week about the return to office policy, held on Zoom, Eric Yuan, the chief executive, faced a series of questions from employees who expressed frustration about the time and money they'd waste while commuting, according to an employee who was at the meeting but was not authorized to speak publicly about internal company matters.
In 2020, participants in daily Zoom meetings leaped to over 300 million, from 10 million the year before, as it became the most downloaded free iPhone app of the year. But the company has struggled to maintain its pandemic growth. In February, amid a wave of layoffs across the tech industry, Zoom cut 15 percent of its staff, or about 1,300 people. The company's work force had grown more than 275 percent between July 2019 and October 2022.
On an earnings call in May, Mr. Yuan said he was confident in the future of workplace flexibility and the benefits it had brought for his company. "I think hybrid work is going to stay," he said.
Zoom, like many other tech companies, is still holding on to some flexibility, requiring its employees to come in only on a part-time basis.
Hybrid and remote work levels remain far above what they were prepandemic. As of July, nearly one-third of the country's full-time workers were in hybrid arrangements, spending some days working from home and some in an office, according to researchers at Stanford.
But dozens of companies have joined Zoom in tightening their policies on office attendance this summer, as offices remain at just under half of their prepandemic occupancy levels.
Google, which has asked employees to come into the office three days a week, announced that managers could take unexcused absences from the office into account when doing performance reviews and could use badge records to identify those absences. Salesforce, taking a softer approach, said it would give a $ 10 charitable donation per day on behalf of any employee who came into the office for a 10-day period in June.
Many companies have faced fierce resistance as they call people back to the office. Hundreds of Amazon's corporate employees walked off the job for an hour in May, protesting the company's announcement that they had to return to the office at least three days a week. At Apple, corporate employees signed petitions protesting their return to the office.
At the start of the pandemic, the tech industry was quick to embrace flexible work, which was enabled by the industry's own products, including Slack (owned by Salesforce), Gmail and Zoom.
But many of those companies realized that they didn't want their employees to remain permanently scattered. Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist and expert on hybrid work, said the tech industry's move back to the office was no surprise given the amount these companies spend on office real estate.
Mr. Bloom said Zoom, for example, had all the downsides of fully remote work -- some employees feeling disconnected -- without the company seeing its financial upsides, like saving money on office space, because the company was still paying for Bay Area real estate and Bay Area employees.
"They're paying for their office and hiring local people so they get no upside from being fully remote," Mr. Bloom said. "The most surprising thing to me was they took so long to formally announce this."
Recent studies have confirmed some benefits to in-person work. A working paper released earlier this year from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the University of Iowa and Harvard found that at one tech firm, remote work decreased the amount of feedback that junior employees received on their work. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that remote work at M.I.T. led to a 38 percent decline in "weak ties," meaning the loose connections that help advance people's careers.
Still, more than 90 percent of workers who can do their jobs remotely now want some flexibility in where they work, according to Gallup.

Super Pets, a Shape-Shifter and a Ladybug: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a stereotype-defying shape-shifter, superpowered shelter pets and the newest "Guardians of the Galaxy" adventure.
'Nimona'
Watch it on Netflix.
Nimona is a shape-shifter, a monster, a misunderstood hellion with a heart of gold. Voiced by Chloë Grace Moretz, the title character busts into a futuristic world where knights defend the castle and the powerful might not be as benevolent as they'd like the citizens to believe. Based on a best-selling graphic novel by ND Stevenson and directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane (who also co-directed "Spies in Disguise"), this 2023 animated feature from Netflix gives young children a mile-a-minute main character who slides between "good guy" and "bad guy" status, defying the usual stereotypes. Stevenson has called the story a transgender allegory, and the L.G.B.T.Q. representation is a welcome change from the usual kids' movie universes, where knights fall in love with princesses, not with each other. Here, Riz Ahmed voices Ballister Boldheart, a knight who has been wrongly accused of murdering Queen Valerin (Lorraine Toussaint). Ballister reluctantly allows Nimona to help him take down a corrupt system, prove his innocence and reunite with his partner, Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang). As a character, Nimona has zero chill and might prove a little tough for adults to watch for any length of time, but my son was entertained by the character's constant motion, chaotic energy and what-will-come-next transformations.
'Miraculous: Ladybug & Cat Noir, The Movie'
Watch it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Many youngsters will already be familiar with the hit French series "Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir," about two Parisian teen superheroes named Marinette (voiced by Cristina Vee for the English-speaking cast) and Adrien (Bryce Papenbrook), who secretly transform into Ladybug and Cat Noir to save their city from villains. They're members of The Miraculous, a group of protectors who vanquish evil all over the world. This time, the superheroes get nearly two hours of screen time to join forces and stop the evil Hawk Moth (Keith Silverstein) from unleashing destruction throughout the City of Light. Directed by Jeremy Zag, who co-wrote the screenplay with Bettina López Mendoza and also wrote the songs, the 2023 movie amps up the action, with plenty of scenes in which Ladybug and Cat Noir fly over Parisian landmarks and battle the bad guys. There are musical numbers, moments of valor, and enough silly humor and flirty banter between the real-life teenagers and their alter egos to keep elementary-age kids watching. The vibrant reds and purples that make the series stand out visually are on full display, and the same girl power theme that defines the series carries over to the film.
'Heroes of the Golden Mask'
Rent it on Amazon Prime and Vudu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In this Arcana Studios 2023 production directed by Sean Patrick O'Reilly, an orphan named Charlie (voiced by Kiefer O'Reilly) is trying his best to survive on the mean streets of his city. Just as Charlie is about to get nabbed by the cops for another petty crime, a door opens and a strange figure offers him a quick escape in the form of a magic portal. Charlie hops through, and he's transported to an ancient Chinese kingdom called Sanxingdui. He meets an unlikely group of golden-masked superheroes who tell Charlie they need his help defeating a ruthless enemy set on conquering the kingdom. At first Charlie schemes to help the heroes with the secret intention of taking the golden masks, but lessons are learned and Charlie discovers that money and greed aren't the most important things in life. The animation looks a little like a low-budget video game, and the writing and performances are definitely not awards-season worthy, but Patton Oswalt voices a blue ogre named Aesop, Ron Perlman voices Kunyi, and Christopher Plummer, before his death, voiced the character Rizzo. It's a bit of a mishmash, but if your kid is craving swordplay, winged tigers and dragons that look like they mated with a moose, give this one a try.
'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'
Watch it on Disney+.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The final installment of the director James Gunn's "Guardians of the Galaxy" trilogy, released in May, might not go down as the best of the three, but it should entertain older elementary school and middle school kids who've come to love Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldaña), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Drax (Dave Bautista). When we meet back up with the Marvel gang, Star-Lord is grieving Gamora, who died in "Avengers: Infinity War." Never fear, though! Gamora (sort of) returns to the crew in the form of a time-traveling variant, but this Gamora has no memory of her relationship with Peter. The story largely centers on Rocket, and the Guardians' attempts to save his life and take down the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), an evil scientist who created Rocket and who is now intent on mutiny. Cooper brings some genuine emotion to Rocket's journey, and Iwuji portrays a formidable villain.
'DC League of Super-Pets'
Watch it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
One could easily imagine this movie being pitched in a conference room: An animated superhero movie, but about their pets! The delightful simplicity of it would be tough to pass up. Here, we have Dwayne Johnson voicing Superman's dog, Krypto, a pup whose favorite chew toy is a little squeaky Batman doll. Youngsters won't care about the voices behind the adorable super-pets, but Kevin Hart, Keanu Reeves, Kate McKinnon, Natasha Lyonne and Marc Maron make a formidable cast. Krypto was sent to Earth as a puppy to look after Superman (voiced by John Krasinski), so the two have a sweet bond that might make both children and adults feel a little weepy because dogs are the best. Krypto can fight crime, but he's a misfit when it comes to relating to non-superhero dogs. When Superman proposes marriage to Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde), he takes Krypto to a shelter to meet some other dogs, so he won't feel like a third wheel, and just like that, a league of super-pets is formed. With a screenplay by the "Lego Batman Movie" writers Jared Stern and John Whittington, this 2022 charmer, directed by Stern and Sam Levine, has enough action, sweetness and humor to warrant multiple viewings.

Gilgo Beach Case Highlights a Storied but Declining Peril: Serial Killers: [National Desk]

Author: Meko, Hurubie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Serial murders have dwindled, thanks to a cautious citizenry and improved technology. But sociopaths have found new methods of mayhem.
Rex Heuermann, the meticulous architectural consultant who the authorities say murdered three women and buried them on a Long Island beach more than a decade ago, may have been among the last of the dying breed of American serial killers.
Even as serial killers came to inhabit a central place in the nation's imagination -- inspiring hit movies, television shows, books, podcasts and more -- their actual number was dwindling dramatically. There were once hundreds at large, and a spike in the 1970s and '80s terrified the country. Now only a handful at most are known to be active, researchers say.
The techniques that led to the arrest of Mr. Heuermann, who has pleaded not guilty to the crimes, help explain the waning of serial killing, which the F.B.I. defines as the same person killing two or more victims in separate events at different times.
It is harder to hide. Rapid advances in investigative technology, video and other digital surveillance tools, as well as the ability to analyze mountains of information, quickly allow the authorities to find killers who before would have gone undetected.
At the same time, Americans have adopted more cautious habits in their everyday lives -- hitchhiking, for example, is less common, and children are driven to and from school. That reduces easy targets. And, some theorize, those bent on killing now opt for spectacular mass murders.
"The 'perfect crime' concept is more of a concept than it ever has been before," said Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
More than a decade ago, prosecutors said, Mr. Heuermann tried to cover his digital tracks by communicating with victims using so-called burner phones, prepaid units purchased anonymously for temporary use.
But thanks to exponential progress in technology since 2010, investigators were able not only to chart Mr. Heuermann's decade-old movements; they could also monitor exactly what he was searching online in recent months. They saw that he was using an anonymous account for internet queries like "Why could law enforcement not trace the calls made by the long island serial killer," prosecutors said. He had also been visiting massage parlors and contacting women working as escorts, they said.
The ubiquity of technology has made it harder to get away with murder, Mr. Wandt said. The amount of data people create in their daily lives is more than many can conceptualize, he said. Just by walking outside, people are now tracked by ever-present cameras, from Amazon's Ring units outside homes to surveillance at banks and retail stores, he said. Every use of a phone or computer creates streams of data that are collected directly on devices or immortalized on servers, he said.
A concerted effort by the federal government to ensure that even the smallest police departments can use technology to their benefit has also helped give investigators an upper hand, Mr. Wandt said.
In 1987, there were 198 known active serial killers -- people connected to at least two murders -- and 404 known victims across the United States, according to a report published three years ago by researchers who run Radford University and Florida Gulf Coast University's Serial Killer Database.
By 2018, there were only 12 known serial killers and 44 victims, according to the report.
"The big question is: Are they going underground and finding other techniques?" said Terence Leary, an associate professor in the psychology department at Florida Gulf Coast University and the team leader for the database.
He said that some serial murderers have killed for discrete periods before taking prolonged breaks: "Maybe they decided to give it up. Who knows?"
As the American way of killing has changed, experts are continuing to refine who should be classified as a serial killer and who a "spree killer" or a mass shooter. They make distinctions among grim data points like the number of victims and the lag between murders.
Spree killings and mass murders occur when someone kills several people in a brief period or single episode, while serial killings can span years. Serial killers' motives are often deeply seated in the psyche: sex, anger and a desire for control.
While mass shootings have increased, many committed by teenagers, serial killings have apparently diminished. But both are committed by "criminal psychopaths," Mr. Leary said. Some people who might once have become serial killers might instead be choosing a single fatal gesture, he said.
Both categories of people display antisocial personality disorder, he said, meaning that they manipulate and violate people without guilt. "It's very possible that a shift is taking place," Mr. Leary said.
The two practices also reflect their respective eras. Mass killers today have taken to livestreaming massacres and leaving behind manifestoes. Serial killers, who flourished in an age before social media, operated clandestinely in many cases. The serial killer who buried his victims near Gilgo Beach was careful to try to hide his crimes. He bound his victims with tape or belts and wrapped them in shrouds of camouflage-patterned burlap.
In all, 11 bodies have been found since 2011 on the stretch of the South Shore that includes Gilgo Beach. In addition to the three deaths in which he is charged, Mr. Heuermann, 59, is the prime suspect in a fourth -- and the investigation continues. On Friday, the authorities said they had identified one set of remains, a skull found on nearby Tobay Beach, in 2011. And after Mr. Heuermann's arrest last month in New York, police departments across the country began trying to link him to disappearances and murders in their jurisdictions.
The police in New Jersey -- and in Las Vegas and South Carolina, where Mr. Heuermann owns property -- looked into whether he could be linked to cold cases there, according to a statement from the Suffolk County Police Department.
Investigators in Rock Hill, S.C., looked into possible links to the 2014 disappearance of an 18-year-old, said Lt. Michael Chavis of the Rock Hill Police Department. In New Jersey, investigators reviewed the killings of four women whose bodies were discovered in 2006 lying face down in several inches of water and spread several feet apart behind a strip of motels in Egg Harbor Township.
So far, those efforts have not led to charges, and the cases remain open, among 256,000 unsolved homicides across the United States since 1980, according to the Murder Accountability Project, a nonprofit organization.
While serial killers' additions to that grim toll have become scant, documentaries, podcasts and shows examining their lives and crimes have boomed. And the internet has created virtual communities across the nation who trade sometimes-fantastical theories about real-life crimes.
When Mr. Heuermann was arrested in July, crowds flocked to his home, a low red house tucked into a quiet block of Massapequa Park.
They were lured by the chance to get a firsthand peek into what investigators say was a secret existence. But if the experts are correct, such opportunities to gawk will become increasingly rare.

'Barbie' Hits $1 Billion at Box Office, Studio Says: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: No movie in Warner Bros. history has sold so many tickets so fast, the studio said of the movie directed by Greta Gerwig.
In the history of Hollywood, very few people -- 28 to be precise, all men -- have had the sole directing credit on a billion-dollar movie.
Make that 28 men and one woman: Greta Gerwig.
"Barbie," directed by Ms. Gerwig from a script she wrote with her partner, Noah Baumbach, will finish the weekend with more than $ 1 billion in ticket sales at the global box office, according to Warner Bros. No movie in the studio's 100-year history has sold so many tickets so fast, said Jeff Goldstein, Warner's president of domestic distribution. As of Sunday, "Barbie" had been playing in theaters for 17 days. ("Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" was previously the fastest to $ 1 billion, at 19 days.)
Ms. Gerwig could not be reached, according to a spokeswoman. Warner Bros. was giddy. "PINK FEVER," Mr. Goldstein wrote in a text message. "Barbie" was No. 1 in the United States and Canada for the third weekend in a row, collecting $ 53 million, for a new domestic total of $ 459.4 million.
"Barbie" once again disproved a stubborn Hollywood myth: that "girl" movies -- films made by women, starring women and aimed at women -- are limited in their appeal. An old movie industry maxim holds that women will go to a "guy" movie but not vice versa.
Other films have challenged that notion, including "Wonder Woman," which was directed by Patty Jenkins and starred Gal Gadot. It collected $ 823 million worldwide for Warner Bros. in 2017. "Captain Marvel," directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck and starring Brie Larson, took in $ 1.1 billion for Disney in 2019. "Twilight," based on Stephenie Meyer's novel and starring Kristen Stewart, was directed by Catherine Hardwicke. It collected $ 408 million for Lionsgate in 2008, starting a blockbuster franchise.
But studios have continued to be hesitant. Before "Barbie" was released, even some Warner Bros. executives challenged the wisdom of giving Ms. Gerwig so much money -- about $ 145 million -- to make such a pink movie. The studio signed Ms. Gerwig and Margot Robbie, who played the title role, to contracts that did not include provisions for sequels.
"Women-centered movies have been undervalued, in large part because studios have so few women in senior leadership roles," said Ana-Christina Ramón, an author of studies about Hollywood hiring that are published annually by the University of California, Los Angeles. "The men in those positions are often reliant on past experience and stereotypes -- Oh, that didn't work before so let's not risk it again."
The success of "Barbie" belongs to hundreds of people, both men and women. Ynon Kreiz, the chief executive of Mattel, allowed Ms. Gerwig to satirize his company and No. 1 toy. Toby Emmerich, a former chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, gave "Barbie" a green light. (Mr. Emmerich stepped down last year. His successors, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, shepherded "Barbie" through postproduction and release.)
Josh Goldstine, Warner's president of worldwide movie marketing, backed "Barbie" with a thundering promotional campaign.
But it was women who, especially early on, pushed "Barbie" ahead in the face of skepticism. "If ever there was an example of why Hollywood needs more women in positions of power, this was it," Ms. Ramón said.
Those women include Robbie Brenner, a "Barbie" producer and the head of Mattel Films -- the executive "who rescued 'Barbie' from development hell," in the words of Vulture, the culture and entertainment news site. After arriving at Mattel in 2018, Ms. Brenner, who was nominated for an Academy Award for producing "Dallas Buyers Club" (2013), teamed with Ms. Robbie, who came onto the project as a producer in addition to lead actress. Ms. Robbie knew Ms. Gerwig, and convinced her to write the script. Later, Ms. Gerwig decided to direct "Barbie."
Courtenay Valenti, Warner's former president of production, played one of the most important roles. She has been credited with seeing promise in "Barbie" from the earliest stage -- recognizing that it was not (just) a commercial for a polarizing toy, but an idea that could reverberate through the culture. Ms. Valenti fought for Ms. Gerwig to have a budget big enough to execute on her vision. (Ms. Valenti left Warner Bros. in February to become the head of film, streaming and theatrical at Amazon Studios and MGM.)
"Barbie" ended up as the biggest box-office hit of Ms. Gerwig's career, by a moonshot, cementing her status as one of Hollywood's young "name" filmmakers -- directors who mainstream ticket buyers recognize as delivering singular work. (Jordan Peele is another.) Ms. Gerwig previously directed "Little Women" (2019) and "Lady Bird" (2017). She has been nominated for three Oscars.

Big Tech Rallies and Channels Its New Momentum Into A.I.: [Correction]

Full text: As the tech giants found their financial footing last quarter, they doubled down on artificial intelligence, which has been a boon to companies like Nvidia.
A year ago, the tech industry's prospects looked bleak. Google's profit dropped. Shares of Facebook's parent company, Meta, were in free fall. Business growth at Amazon had slowed to its lowest level in two decades.
But what looked like an industrywide bust appears to have been more of a correction. The most recent quarter was surprisingly strong for tech's biggest companies. Meta's and Google's ad businesses rebounded. Microsoft's cloud computing business continued to expand. So did Amazon's e-commerce business. Apple, with a 1 percent decline, was the only big tech company whose revenue dropped.
Still, the slump exposed a weakness: The world's largest tech companies hadn't developed a big new idea in years. Despite pouring money into self-driving cars, the metaverse and quantum computers, the businesses still relied on digital ad sales, iPhones and cloud computing.
Now the companies are hoping that artificial intelligence will be the answer to the problem and a way to refresh aging product lines that haven't changed all that much in recent years. They have plans to invest billions in generative A.I. technology, which powers chatbots like ChatGPT.
While making serious money from new A.I. products is still a ways off, a quick return to form has given the companies plenty of room to experiment.
In a call with investors on Thursday, Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said work on generative A.I. was still in early stages, but "I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know." Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, made similar comments on Thursday. And during recent calls with analysts, Google, Meta and Microsoft also said they would increase investments to support A.I. work.
For tech observers such as Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst who has covered the chip industry for 15 years, the surge in spending to support the development of A.I. is reminiscent of the investments in servers in the late 1990s and data centers in 2010. Generative A.I. is expected to deliver more than $ 2 trillion in economic benefits, according to McKinsey, the corporate consultancy, by increasing productivity across a host of businesses.
The A.I. investments could also lift cloud computing sales across tech. The number of customers using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, a tool to build on the generative A.I. models developed by its partner OpenAI, has increased this year to more than 11,000, from 250. Microsoft said A.I. would contribute two percentage points of growth to the Azure business in the current quarter.
"It's very early, but no one wants to be left behind," said Gavin Baker, managing partner at Atreides Management, a Boston investment firm with $ 3.5 billion under management.
Mr. Baker compared it to the early days of the commercial internet in the 1990s. "It was obvious it would change the world, so people kept investing," he said. "The same is happening with A.I."
Generative A.I. products are just starting to hit the market. Microsoft plans to charge $ 360 a year for Microsoft 365 Copilot, an A.I.-powered assistant for Word, Excel and PowerPoint. But the amount of new sales it generates won't be clear until sometime next year, according to analysts.
For the chip maker Nvidia, the A.I. boom has already arrived. In May, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by forecasting that it would generate $ 11 billion in sales in its second quarter, which ended July 30, exceeding analysts' expectations by more than $ 4 billion.
The big jump reflected surging demand for the graphics processing units, or GPUs, it designs to power A.I. technologies. Nvidia has no serious rivals in that market.
"It seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs," Elon Musk said during a Twitter Spaces in April while discussing his plans for an A.I. company.
Nvidia's data center business is projected to double sales this year, adding $ 15 billion. It is predicted to add $ 20 billion in new sales next year, according to Bernstein Research. And Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, making the company one of a handful with a total value over $ 1 trillion.
Nvidia anticipated the A.I. boom. For years, Jensen Huang, the company's chief executive, had talked about how GPUs would power A.I. technologies. He was so convinced of this that he told analysts in 2017 that the company was "all in" on a single chip design.
"It's all going to work out, or it's going to work out terribly," Mr. Huang said.
Other semiconductor companies are trying to claim a piece of the A.I. expansion. Broadcom has had some early success by working on custom A.I. chips for Google, and AMD is introducing a GPU in a bid to loosen Nvidia's grip on the most important corner of the market.
If all the investment in A.I. fails to generate the financial boom that companies and investors hope, the tech companies that have splurged on GPUs and A.I. systems should be able to bear the costs and stomach the disappointment, Mr. Rasgon said. The recent quarter has demonstrated that their existing businesses are far from falling apart.
"If they guessed wrong, it's not an enormous hit," Mr. Rasgon said. "It would be a problem, but they can absorb it."

Judge Limits Scope of Trial Vs. Google: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The ruling did not affect some central parts of the antitrust cases about Google search, which are scheduled to go to trial next month.
A federal judge said this week that the Justice Department and a group of states could not move forward with some claims in antitrust complaints against Google, narrowing the scope of what is set to be the most significant federal monopoly trial against a tech giant in decades.
In the decision, which was unsealed on Friday, Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed four claims in the lawsuits and allowed government lawyers to move forward with three.
Judge Mehta wrote that a trial was warranted to assess whether Google's exclusivity deals for web browsers and preloading its services on Android devices illegally helped the internet company maintain a monopoly. But he said the government had not "demonstrated the requisite anticompetitive effect" to prove that Google broke the law in other ways, such as by boosting its own products in search results over those of specialized sites, like Amazon and Yelp.
The decision sets the stage for the first major tech monopoly trial since the federal government took Microsoft to court in the 1990s, amid a renewed backlash over the power of tech giants. In recent years, American regulators have filed lawsuits and tried to block the acquisitions of companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as they have grown in reach and size.
Some efforts by regulators to challenge the tech giants have faltered. Twice this year, federal judges have declined to grant Federal Trade Commission requests to stop tech deals, allowing Meta to close the purchase of a virtual reality start-up and clearing the way for Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
But the Google trial, which is scheduled to begin on Sept. 12, stands out as the most direct government attempt in years to confront one of the world's biggest tech companies about longtime business practices. The trial is expected to last almost 10 weeks and to scrutinize not only how Google conducts business but its relationships with other major companies, such as Apple and Samsung, which have largely been shrouded in secrecy.
Bill Baer, a former Justice Department antitrust official, said the cases were as significant as the landmark litigation against Microsoft.
The outcome "will set an important precedent about whether these dominant tech platforms are engaging in behavior that limits competition and disadvantages consumers," he said.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the company appreciated Judge Mehta's "careful consideration and decision to dismiss claims regarding the design of Google Search."
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
The department filed an antitrust case against Google under President Donald J. Trump in 2020. It argues that the Silicon Valley company exploits its power over online search and the ads that appear in search results. The lawsuit was ultimately combined for trial with a separate case about Google search that was filed that same year by the attorneys general of 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.
The Justice Department has separately filed another antitrust case against Google, focused on the company's software for placing ads across the web, which is headed to trial as soon as next year.
In his ruling, Judge Mehta allowed the core of the Justice Department's case to stand. But he dismissed three of the agency's claims regarding Google's management of the Android operating system, its relationships to phone makers that use Android and its Google Assistant service. He also threw out a central claim brought by the states, which accused Google of providing top billing in its search results to its own products.
Judge Mehta acknowledged in his opinion that Google was extremely popular and noted the bar that government lawyers must clear to prove that it had broken antitrust rules.
It is not illegal for Google to have a monopoly alone, he wrote, adding, "A company with monopoly power acts unlawfully only when its conduct stifles competition."
At trial, both sides are set to argue over whether the company's multibillion-dollar agreements to be the default search engine on various devices and browsers are anticompetitive, which could have significant consequences for its core business. Google's search engine collected $ 162 billion in advertising revenue last year.
Google has argued that these pacts with companies like Apple and Samsung are simple distribution deals that are common in business, and that the government has tried to penalize Google because of its popularity.
The agreements have been a linchpin in Google's efforts to be easily accessible to large audiences. The company retains an estimated 94 percent of search engine traffic on mobile devices, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.

Ever-Shrinking Pac-12 Loses Oregon and Washington to the Big Ten: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Big Ten booms to 18 schools with the move, powered by TV money, and the once-great Pac-12 dwindles to four after three more schools leave for the Big 12.
Two weeks ago, George Kliavkoff, the commissioner of the Pac-12 Conference, stood on a Las Vegas nightclub stage and -- after a video montage celebrating the league's rich history of star quarterbacks that runs to the present -- confidently proclaimed a bright future.
A new media rights deal would be announced "in the near future," he said at the conference's football media day. The impending agreement would lock in 10 schools and pave the way for expansion, eliminating the uncertainty that had hovered over the Pac-12 since the University of Southern California and U.C.L.A. had bolted for the Big Ten last summer.
Kliavkoff waved off concerns about the Big 12 poaching his schools.
"The truth is we have bigger fish to fry," Kliavkoff said.
By the end of Friday, the Pac-12 was cooked.
A week after Colorado jumped to the Big 12, two of the conference's remaining cornerstones, Oregon and Washington, refused to agree to a proposed television contract they deemed insufficient and instead headed to the Big Ten. Later, Arizona leapt to the Big 12, taking Arizona State and Utah with them.
By nightfall, all that was left of the Pac-12 were Stanford, California, Washington State, Oregon State and the memories of a century-old alliance.
"The old question -- how long would it take TV money to destroy college football? Maybe we're here. Maybe we're here," Washington State football Coach Jake Dickert told reporters after his team's practice on Thursday, when the rumblings of a collapse gathered momentum. "To think even remotely, five years ago, the Pac-12 would be in this position, it's unthinkable to think that we're here today."
It might have been unthinkable just a few days ago. There was little interest in the Big Ten in expansion -- until earlier this week, when it looked as if Arizona was itching to leave. And if Oregon and Washington, so unhappy with a Pac-12 media deal that centered on Apple TV, were coming hat in hand, willing to take a reduced offer ...
The Big Ten cobbled together a proposal, the Northwest schools nodded yes, and after a quick meeting of the Big Ten's council of presidents and chancellors on Friday evening, the conference announced that a year from now, it would comprise 18 teams.
The Pac-12 has billed itself as the Conference of Champions, which is hardly hyperbole. Stanford, U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. have each won at least twice as many national championships as any other school. Cal and Oregon rank among the top 15.
But the increasingly big business of college sports is driven, more than ever, by football's television lucre. Everything else is just details.
Schools in the Big Ten, like Ohio State and Michigan, and those in the Southeastern Conference, like Georgia and Louisiana State, reap enough money solely from football television rights -- upwards of $ 50 million -- to cover the entire athletic budget at a school like Florida Atlantic, which reached the Final Four this year in men's basketball.
Hundreds of millions more from television rights are distributed to the top conferences from the six College Football Playoff bowls.
Those windfalls, though, are mostly plowed back into football in the form of ballooning staffs, ever more opulent facilities and amenities that service the athletes, who do not share the revenue directly but who take on a greater burden of conference realignment with coast-to-coast travel.
That travel burden will be shared by athletes in the non-revenue sports, like tennis players at Arizona taking trips to Central Florida and West Virginia, and lacrosse players at Oregon going to Rutgers and Penn State.
The Pac-12's demise, as quickly as it arrived, was years in the making.
A little more than a decade ago, the conference's commissioner, Larry Scott, was hailed as a visionary -- a college sports outsider who landed a 12-year, $ 2.7 billion media deal after adding Colorado and Utah that more than tripled the conference's rights fees and placed it ahead of every other conference.
But Scott's insistence on launching the Pac-12 Network without ESPN or Fox as a partner turned into a colossal failure because the conference had no leverage with cable distributors. Thus, many of them refused to meet the Pac-12's asking price and left the network with far fewer viewers -- and far less revenue -- than other conference networks.
Scott was forced out and replaced by Kliavkoff, a former MGM executive, two years ago. But by then, the conference's revenue gap, and U.C.L.A.'s $ 100 million budget shortfall, made the Los Angeles schools an inviting target for the Big Ten, whose pursuit was done hand-in-hand with Fox, its business partner.
The Pac-12, whose media rights deal expires after the 2023 season, immediately began negotiations for a new agreement after U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. announced their departures last summer. But the Big 12 jumped ahead, reaching an early extension with Fox in October that would generate an average payout of $ 31.7 million per school.
That deal, considerably less than those of the Big Ten and the SEC, convinced the Pac-12 to downgrade its expectations. Kliavkoff told the University of California Regents, when he was encouraging them to block U.C.L.A.'s move to the Big Ten, that the Pac-12 was lowering its estimates by 10 percent.
Even worse for the Pac-12, its list of potential partners had dwindled by then. By November, Fox had agreements with the Big Ten (as did CBS and NBC) and the Big 12, and ESPN had the SEC and A.C.C. Meanwhile, cord cutting had roiled the cable industry, even cooling ESPN's voracious appetite for college football.
It was around then that Amazon and Apple became serious bidders.
But Kliavkoff's inability to close a deal -- expectations of January gave way to April, which gave way to June -- tested the patience and the confidence that the terms, which were a tightly held secret, would be satisfactory.
"Today's news is incredibly disappointing for student-athletes, fans, alumni and staff of the Pac-12," the conference said late Friday in a statement. "We remain focused on securing the best possible future for each of our member universities."
Ultimately, the Apple deal that was laid out this week guaranteed schools more than $ 20 million with revenue sharing from subscriptions that could push each school's cut into the $ 30 million range, and perhaps higher, according to a person familiar with the proposal.
Though streaming appears to be the future, there were concerns about committing so wholeheartedly to a medium that older fans may not understand. And would recruits even see the product?
The proposal's structure mirrored Apple's 10-year, $ 250-million deal with Major League Soccer, which is required to reinvest some of that money in its broadcasts, but whose luring of Lionel Messi could leave the league in a strong position to reap additional revenue from subscription sales.
Of course, there is an international appeal of soccer -- and Messi -- that might drive Apple TV subscriptions around the world in a way that Oregon State football just can't match.

Shares Slip to End a Rare Losing Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks fell Friday to close out a rare losing week for Wall Street following mixed reports on the U.S. job market and two of the market's most influential stocks.
The S&P 500 sank 23.86, or 0.5 percent, to 4,478.03. It was the fourth straight drop for Wall Street's main measure of health after it set a 16-month high at the start of the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average also drifted between gains and losses through the day before ending with a loss. It dropped 150.27 points, or 0.4 percent, to 35,065.62, and the Nasdaq composite gave up 50.48, or 0.4 percent, to 13,909.24.
Treasury yields tumbled in the bond market after a highly anticipated U.S. jobs report said hiring was a touch weaker last month than economists expected, though wages for workers rose more than forecast.
The job market is in a precarious place, where investors want a reading that's neither too hot nor too cold. On one hand, investors want it to remain strong enough to keep the economy out of a long-predicted recession. On the other, they don't want wage growth in particular to be so strong that the Federal Reserve sees it putting upward pressure on inflation.
Friday's reading offered no slam dunks for either side, but analysts said it may suggest a job market that's moderating.
"Over the last year the labor market has shifted from one where everyone wins to one where there are plenty of areas of weakness," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. "Wage growth was stronger than expected, but coupled with a shorter workweek you get lower incomes. Fed officials will see what they want to see, but it's pretty clear that manufacturing is struggling and services is slowing."
If the job market keeps moderating, it could allow inflation to continue to cool from its peak reached last summer. That in turn would bolster Wall Street's hopes that the Federal Reserve won't hike interest rates any more.
High rates work to grind down inflation by slowing the overall economy and hurting prices for investments. The Fed has already pulled its federal funds rate to its highest level in more than two decades, up from virtually zero early last year.
Critics, though, say it's far from assured that inflation will easily drop back down to the Fed's target and that the economy will avoid a painful recession. That's why they say the 19.5 percent surge for the S&P 500 through this year's first seven months was too much, too fast. This week was just the third losing week for the S&P 500 in the last 12.
Big Tech stocks in particular led Wall Street's charge this year, with expectations for strong continued growth leading to tremendous gains in their stock prices. Two of them offered a mixed picture of their results after trading ended Thursday.
Amazon jumped 8.3 percent in its first trading after it reported a much bigger profit for the spring than expected. The company said growth for its important cloud-computing business stabilized during the quarter, and its revenue also topped analysts' forecasts.
Apple, though, slumped 4.8 percent despite reporting stronger profit than expected. Its revenue only just barely topped analysts' estimates, and its forecast for revenue in the current quarter didn't blow past expectations.
Its stock had already cruised 47 percent higher for the year through Thursday, with its total value topping $ 3 trillion, meaning high expectations were built into its price.
Because it is the biggest stock on Wall Street by market value, Apple's movements pack extra punch on the S&P 500 and other indexes. It was the single biggest weight on the S&P 500 Friday by far.
Like Amazon and Apple, most companies in the S&P 500 have been reporting stronger profits for the spring than analysts expected. That's usually the case, but expectations were particularly low coming into this reporting season. Analysts are still calling for the worst drop in profit declines for S&P 500 companies in nearly three years.
Booking Holdings jumped 7.9 percent for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after it blew past analysts' forecasts for the spring. It said customers are looking to book leisure travel, and the strong demand is continuing into the current quarter. Its brands include Booking.com and Priceline.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.04 percent from 4.18 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.77 percent from 4.89 percent.

Sales Down, But Apple Lifts Profit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The iPhone maker's recent quarter benefited from strong sales in its App Store and other services businesses.
The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world's most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $ 81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $ 19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple's financial results were the latest indication that tech's biggest companies have found their footing after last year's downturn. Last week, Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.
The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $ 5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $ 6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple's share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.
Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $ 39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world's second-largest economy.
"We've done a really good job with affordability programs around the world," said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. "The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing."
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company's services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $ 21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $ 8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $ 3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won't go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
"While I'm pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market," said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, during the call with analysts. "It's a huge opportunity for us."
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company's supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming "incrementally incremental."

A Reminder of the Right Kind of Melodrama: [Review]

Full text: Sigourney Weaver stars in an Australian family thriller full of stormy emotions and strangely beautiful terrain.
The title of the new Amazon offering "The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart," with its echo of V.C. Andrews's Gothic novels of family calamity, is a case of truth in advertising. The seven-episode Australian mini-series, which is based on the novel by Holly Ringland and premiered Thursday on Prime Video, is an unapologetic melodrama -- a family saga in which lies and secrets proliferate beyond all reason, putting parents and children, friends and bystanders, through unnaturally intense storms of emotion.
That it's also entertaining, moving and vividly atmospheric is a pleasant surprise in a time when melodrama tends toward the banal (some variety of soap opera) or the scolding (some variety of humorless social critique). "Lost Flowers" is a reminder that when it is handled with skill, sophistication and a measure of restraint, melodrama can be as satisfying as any other style of storytelling.
The story involves a complicated web of relationships centering on Thornhill, a flower farm that doubles as a refuge for troubled women, who are called "flowers." Some of the women, though not all of them, are escaping abusive men. The farm is run by a forbidding matriarch, June (Sigourney Weaver), with the help of her Indigenous lover, Twig (Leah Purcell), and their adopted daughter, Candy (Frankie Adams).
June is one pole of a story in which the keeping of shameful family secrets is the foundation of tragedy. The other pole is Alice, who is a child when we first see her (played by Alyla Browne) and knows nothing about June, her grandmother. Savage events unite them early on so that they can spend the rest of the series being drawn together and, as Alice works her way through June's lies, torn apart again.
Most of the first half of "Lost Flowers" is tied to the point of view of this young Alice, and the director and cinematographer, Glendyn Ivin and Sam Chiplin, give these episodes the seductive texture of an ominous, doom-tinged fairy tale. Using the strangely beautiful landscape of the New South Wales coast, they create an ambience that reflects Alice's childlike, wavering apprehension of the unreasoning violence that regularly bursts into her life.
They are helped immensely by Browne, who gives a terrific performance even though Alice spends several episodes mostly mute while recovering from trauma. Sadness, rebelliousness and a puckish sense of humor are there in her eyes. Though she shares the screen with Weaver and with the Australian star Asher Keddie, who plays a sympathetic but self-righteous local librarian, Browne draws you right to her.
Midway through, the series jumps ahead more than a decade, and Alice, now a young woman played by Alycia Debnam-Carey, finds herself in another magical setting -- this time a national park where a volcanic crater provides a haven for wildflowers.
The change of scenery is symbolic -- away from the protection of the farm, Alice is free both to find herself and to start repeating harmful family patterns when it comes to men. And the writing, led by the series's showrunner, Sarah Lambert, dries out a little along with the landscape. These episodes feel more like something we've seen before, though a bit of the earlier enchantment lingers in a plot strand involving Twig's long road trip in search of Alice.
What carries you through, finally -- as you might expect -- is Weaver. "Lost Flowers" doesn't play to her traditional strengths -- the taciturn, bottled-up June doesn't provide much of a canvas for Weaver's regal-yet-feral intelligence or her deadly sense of humor. She can get more out of sheer presence and stubborn charisma, however, than most performers do from busily acting, and in the later episodes she takes over, carrying off some wonderful moments as June slows down and opens up. Weaver's work in series has been sparse and unpredictable; getting to spend seven episodes with her is the icing on the melodrama.

This Weekend I Have ...: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Our critic recommends an offbeat Australian comedy, an endearing art show and the essential lawyer show "L.A. Law," which is now streaming.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I want a wry comedy.
'Fisk'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
Kitty Flanagan cocreated and stars in this Australian comedy about a lawyer whose life collapses, so she finds herself working in a dinky suburban law firm. "Fisk" has a fun and offbeat style, not quite as strange as "Stath Lets Flats" but set in a similarly askew world populated by enchanting oddballs. It's also the rare comedy to operate largely as a procedural, with new clients each episode. If you wish you could mash up "Boston Legal" and "The Office," with an emphasis on Dwight and Angela, try this. Two seasons have aired in Australia, but so far only the first six-episode season is available in the United States.
... a few hours, and my walls are a little bare.
'Home Is Where the Art Is'
When to watch: Now, on Pluto and the Roku Channel.
In each episode of this chill, endearing British series, three artists compete to create custom work for grateful buyers. The artists scope out a couple's home, trying to determine their tastes and interests, and then each creates a pitch; two artists move ahead and make pieces, and then one is declared the winner. "Home" covers a wide range of artistic disciplines, and because the stakes are pretty low -- most pieces cost around $ 350 -- the vibe is congenial, not cutthroat. If you like "Portrait Artist of the Year" or "The Great Pottery Throw Down," try this.
... many, many hours, and I like a banging gavel.
'L.A. Law'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
Journey back in time to an era when television looked as if it were filmed on an electronic potato, when episodes of network dramas were 49 minutes long and seasons usually 22 episodes, when saxophones were king and David E. Kelley was an unknown. "L.A. Law" premiered in 1986, ushering in a new kind of prime-time lawyer show and defining the early careers of many of its stars. While the show's age is often apparent, many of the issues its characters argue about -- racist policing, shabby outcomes for victims of sexual assault, gender equity -- are still plenty timely.
Completists, take note: Not every single episode is available yet, though Amazon says they are coming. But if you can tolerate a little bit of swiss-cheesing for the time being, this is an essential show.

Sharpest Drop in Months on Wall Street: [Correction]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/sharpest-drop-months-on-wall-street/docview/2844978624/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street tumbled to its worst drop in months on Wednesday as its torrid rally that critics called overdone lost more momentum.
The S&P 500 sank 1.4 percent for its sharpest tumble since April. It was the second straight loss for the index after it hit a 16-month high last week.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 348 points, or 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.2 percent.
Prices were mixed in the bond market after Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating of the U.S. government. The repeated standoffs in Congress about whether to allow a default on the U.S. debt were just some of the reasons for Fitch's cut. The downgrade strikes at the core of the global financial system because U.S. Treasurys are considered some of the safest possible investments.
Fitch's move follows a similar one by Standard & Poor's in 2011. That downgrade coincided with a European debt crisis and helped lead stocks and bonds around the world to swing violently. So far, the most recent move has caused less turmoil across markets.
While the downgrade highlights how much debt the U.S. government has and the big challenges it faces in how to pay for Social Security, Medicare and other expenses, none of that is news for investors.
"Fitch's downgrade is much ado about nothing," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
"Yes, it's good to call out the fiscal situation," he said, "but when a country only issues debt in its own currency, the credit rating is irrelevant. Every investment fund I've looked at specifies that U.S. Treasury securities are allowed investments, regardless of what a credit rating agency might think."
The big issues for Wall Street remain whether the economy can avoid a long-predicted recession, as hoped, and what's happening with corporate profits. Reports on both of those questions came in mixed on Wednesday.
That offered fodder for critics who say investors were too quick to buy the belief that a soft landing was surely ahead for the economy. They've been saying Wall Street rallied too much, too quickly this year. Analysts said some of Wednesday's selling could be investors locking in profits made during the S&P 500's 19.5 percent run for the year through July.
One report suggested that hiring in the private sector remained much stronger than economists had expected, even if it slowed from the prior month.
A job market that remains solid could keep a lid on worries about a possible recession. But investors also fear a too-strong reading, which could persuade the Federal Reserve that too much upward pressure still exists on inflation.
The Fed has already yanked its federal funds rate higher at tremendous speed in hopes of undercutting inflation. High rates do that by slowing the economy bluntly, but that risks causing a recession and hurts prices of investments along the way.
Inflation has been cooling since last summer's peak, and the rising hope on Wall Street had been that the Fed wouldn't hike rates anymore and could even begin cutting them next year.
Wednesday's stronger-than-expected jobs report from ADP could be a signal of what Friday's more comprehensive report from the U.S. government will say. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has highlighted Friday's numbers as a big influence on the central bank's next move in September.
Higher rates tend to hurt technology and other high-growth stocks in particular, and Big Tech stocks helped drag the market lower. Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon all fell more than 2.5 percent and were some of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.
Most companies this reporting season, though, have been topping profit expectations. That's usually the case, and expectations were quite low coming into this reporting season. Analysts were forecasting a third straight quarter of weaker earnings per share for S&P 500 companies.
On the winning side of Wall Street was CVS Health, which rose 3.3 percent after it reported a milder drop in results than expected. Humana climbed 5.6 percent after it topped expectations for the latest quarter.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 63.34 to 4,513.39. The Dow dropped 348.16 to 35,282.52, and the Nasdaq sank 310.47 to 13,973.45.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were broadly lower across Europe and Asia.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose to 4.07 percent from 4.04 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to 4.89 percent from 4.91 percent as its price rose.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, three dancers claim that touring with the Grammy winner meant working in an "overtly sexual atmosphere" that subjected them to harassment.
Three of Lizzo's former dancers filed a lawsuit against her on Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, accusing the Grammy-winning singer and the captain of her dance team of creating a hostile work environment while performing concerts on her Special Tour this year.
The lawsuit, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times by the plaintiffs' law firm, said the dancers had been "exposed to an overtly sexual atmosphere that permeated their workplace," which included "outings where nudity and sexuality were a focal point," it said. The suit was first reported by NBC.
The defendants include Lizzo, using her full name Melissa Jefferson instead of her stage name; her production company, Big Grrrl Big Touring Inc.; and Shirlene Quigley, the tour's dance captain. It does not specify whether the singer was aware of the plaintiffs' allegations linked to Ms. Quigley.
The suit alleges that Lizzo was involved in several episodes that lawyers for the three dancers said amounted to sexual harassment and weight shaming, among other allegations.
Ms. Quigley was also accused of making sexually explicit comments to the dancers, and the lawsuit accuses her of engaging in religious harassment. Ms. Quigley "made it her mission to preach" Christianity to the dancers, the lawsuit says, and appeared to be fixated on one plaintiff's virginity.
On one occasion while at a nightclub in Amsterdam, the lawsuit says, Lizzo began inviting employees to touch nude performers and handle dildos and bananas used in their performances.
Out of fear of retaliation, a dancer eventually "acquiesced" to touching the breast of a nude female performer despite repeatedly expressing no interest in doing so, the suit says.
Representatives for Lizzo and her production company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
Two of the plaintiffs, Arianna Davis and Crystal Williams, began performing with Lizzo after competing on her reality television show on Amazon Prime, "Watch Out for the Big Grrrls," in 2021. The show was an opportunity to give plus-size dancers representation, Lizzo said at the time. Ms. Davis and Ms. Williams were fired in the spring of 2023, the lawsuit says.
Separately, a third plaintiff, Noelle Rodriguez, was hired in May 2021 to perform in Lizzo's "Rumors" music video and remained on as part of her dance team. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Rodriguez resigned shortly after Ms. Davis and Ms. Williams had been fired.
Some of the allegations seemed to take aim at Lizzo's reputation for championing body positivity and inclusivity.
"The stunning nature of how Lizzo and her management team treated their performers seems to go against everything Lizzo stands for publicly," a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Ron Zambrano, said in a statement on Tuesday. Privately, he said, Lizzo "weight-shames her dancers and demeans them in ways that are not only illegal but absolutely demoralizing."
Some of Lizzo's statements to the dancers gave Ms. Davis, who was diagnosed with a binge eating disorder, the impression that she had to "explain her weight gain and disclose intimate personal details about her life in order to keep her job," the suit says.
Since her breakout hit "Truth Hurts" dominated charts in 2019, Lizzo has popularized "feel-good music" and self-love and has celebrated diversity in all forms by churning out empowerment anthems, introducing a size-inclusive shapewear line and racking up millions of views on social media.
She won this year's Grammy for record of the year for "About Damn Time."
Diana Reddy, an assistant professor at the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, said that allegations that fall outside legally protected categories could undermine Lizzo's body-positive message and "could certainly encourage a settlement."
Proving a hostile work environment in the unconventional entertainment industry is difficult, she said, so the plaintiffs' lawyers could be hoping for a settlement. "Employment discrimination plaintiffs don't fare particularly well in court," Ms. Reddy said.

Fund-Raising for Kennedy's Campaign Draws From a Most Unusual Coalition: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A super PAC backing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid for the Democratic nomination received $ 5 million from a major Republican donor who has supported Donald J. Trump in the past.
As he cut into steak frites at the recent fund-raiser he hosted for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, the financier Omeed Malik surveyed the crowd.
What he saw on that July evening was unusual, he said: Environmentalists and admirers of Mr. Kennedy's family were mingling at a restaurant in Sag Harbor, N.Y., alongside Hollywood figures, hippies and right-wing conservatives.
"It was a complete hodgepodge of characters that I have never seen at a political event," recalled Mr. Malik, an investor and merchant banker based in Palm Beach, Fla. "Because everyone is attracted to him for a different reason."
Fueled by an unusual combination of views -- passionate environmentalism, for example, alongside a deep distrust of the pharmaceutical industry and public health orthodoxy -- Mr. Kennedy's campaign has stood out for its curious coalition of Democrats, Republicans and independents of varying backgrounds.
Financial filings this week from two super PACs supporting him, which together have raised nearly $ 10.5 million, seemed to underscore this theme. The pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 received the bulk of its money from two megadonors: one who has contributed tens of millions to Republican causes, and another who has backed both Democrats and Republicans.
Timothy Mellon, a Wyoming Republican who contributed $ 53 million in stock to a Texas fund paying for construction of a new border wall, gave that super PAC $ 5 million. Gavin de Becker, a security executive who describes himself as a Democrat and consulted for the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos during Mr. Bezos's text message scandal, donated $ 4.5 million.
"The fact that Kennedy gets so much bipartisan support tells me two things," Mr. Mellon, previously a top donor to former President Donald J. Trump, said in a statement issued by American Values 2024. "That he's the one candidate who can unite the country and root out corruption, and that he's the one Democrat who can win the general election."
In 2019 and 2020, Mr. Mellon gave $ 70 million combined to super PACs pushing for Republican control of the House and Senate and to one supporting Mr. Trump, records show.
The support from Republicans is likely to heighten suspicions about Mr. Kennedy's candidacy among Democrats who see him as a pawn in an effort to undermine President Biden. Dozens of venture capitalists, tech executives, real-estate builders and investors with varying political alliances also contributed to the Kennedy-aligned PACs.
Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of Overstock.com -- and one of the most prominent supporters of the effort to overturn the 2020 election -- gave $ 100,000 in Bitcoin to Common Sense, another PAC supporting Mr. Kennedy.
Abby Rockefeller, a daughter of the investment banker David Rockefeller who runs a cannabis farm in upstate New York, gave $ 100,000 to the American Values 2024 PAC. She said in a statement that she always voted for Democrats.
Common Sense reported a total fund-raising haul of about $ 711,000 in the three-month period ending in June.
Mr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, the scion of a storied American political dynasty and a hero of the so-called medical freedom movement -- which has seeded public skepticism about vaccines and other public health measures -- is unlikely to prevail in his quest for the Democratic nomination.
More than five months before the Iowa caucuses, he is trailing far behind Mr. Biden. He has the support of just 13 percent of registered voters compared with Mr. Biden's 64 percent, according to a recent New York Times/Siena poll.
And his financial support is likely to pale in comparison with the powerhouse of fund-raising and institutional support behind the incumbent president.
But the fact that some of deep-pocketed supporters include some who favored Mr. Trump in the past suggest that those numbers may have room to grow.
"I don't think he has the influential tech leaders," said Charles Phillips, a venture capitalist who co-founded a nonpartisan PAC to support candidates with strategies for economic growth in Black communities. Mr. Kennedy, he added, "won't get broad support. Most of the tech guys supporting him are really Republicans."
Mr. Mellon, the grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, also gave $ 5 million last quarter to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the House of Representatives, and $ 1 million to Fair Courts America, a committee backed by other major Republican donors that has supported conservative candidates for state supreme court seats.
Some of Mr. Kennedy's smaller-scale supporters said their admiration was driven by Mr. Kennedy's unfiltered quality as well as his willingness to take on legacy institutions like the mainstream news media (which he says has censored him), the banking system (which he believes takes advantage of consumers), the medical establishment (he has said that big government has been co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry), and the government's response to Covid-19, which he has said was both overreaching and ineffective.
Some are willing to set aside his more extreme views -- including his vaccine skepticism and his conspiracy theories about anti-depressants and "Deep State" corruption -- because they admire what they see as his integrity.
The Sag Harbor dinner last month drew more than 30 attendees who each pledged $ 6,600 to Mr. Kennedy's campaign, the maximum amount that can be contributed by individuals to a campaign for a primary and a general-election bid combined, according to Mr. Malik. During the evening, Mr. Kennedy took questions on subjects including Russia's war in Ukraine and cryptocurrency.
In June, Common Sense PAC hosted a fund-raiser in San Francisco with two tech investors, David Sacks -- a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Republican donor who has supported Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida -- and Chamath Palihapitiya, a former senior executive at Facebook.

A Restaurant Staple Aims for Home Chefs: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent Friday morning, the cookbook author Molly Baz put the finishing touch on a new recipe for shingled tomato toast with sesame mayo. Reaching into a wooden salt cellar, she grabbed a three-finger pinch of salt and showered her dish.
Not just any salt -- Diamond Crystal kosher salt.
"It's just the only way," Ms. Baz said. "It's probably the most-used salt in all professional kitchens."
In FX's "The Bear," brick-red boxes of Diamond Crystal are visible throughout the restaurant's kitchen. Sydney, the chef de cuisine, instructs a chef de partie to salt T-bone steaks "like a sidewalk" with it.
Ina Garten has called the salt "perfect." It's used in recipe testing at America's Test Kitchen and Bon Appétit. When rumors swirled in 2019 that the salt would be discontinued, Francis Lam, the editor in chief of the cookbook publisher Clarkson Potter, bought 10 boxes.
Yet, it's never been easy for home cooks to get their hands on a box. Weighing three pounds and standing nine inches tall, the large box was designed for the demands of restaurants, not home kitchens. It doesn't fit nicely on a supermarket shelf because it was never meant to be sold there, and so it's often out of reach on the top shelf or stuffed on the bottom. Availability has been fickle.
After decades focused on supplying the food-service industry, Diamond Crystal has decided to pass the salt to home cooks by giving the heritage brand founded in 1886 a glow up. A redesigned box began replacing the old design quietly last fall. And in June, Diamond Crystal, with its more modern packaging, hit shelves at national retailers like Trader Joe's for the first time, to great fervor.
Before 2020, the salt had modest retail distribution, mostly in the Northeast, said Sonya Roberts, the president of salt business at Cargill, the agribusiness conglomerate that owns Diamond Crystal. But when restaurants closed during the pandemic, demand grew. "The Amazon numbers of the big red box were off the charts," she said.
Rachita Vasan, an advertising strategist in Portland, Ore., thrived on takeout until the pandemic nudged her into the kitchen. She started following food writers on social media and soon got the message: "Don't use table salt." Ms. Vasan, 29, started buying Diamond Crystal.
The hollow, lightweight crystals produced by the company's proprietary method are brittle and crushable, making it an ideal salt for seasoning to taste because it quickly dissolves in food.
Recipe developers favor Diamond Crystal over its main competitor, Morton coarse kosher salt, which is denser and nearly twice as salty. (This is the reason some recipes specify using Diamond Crystal; the two brands are not interchangeable.) But when it comes to salt, most people think of umbrellas, not diamonds. More than 90 percent of kosher salt buyers choose Morton, according to market research by Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
To help change that, Cargill, a 160-year-old Midwestern company, recruited Enlisted Design, a 15-year-old design firm in Oakland, Calif.
In a presentation, Enlisted Design represented Diamond Crystal's new target demographic -- "the aspiring home chef" -- with two avatars: "the academic" (a dude with a goatee) and "the entertainer" (a gal with an Afro and septum piercing). "The traditionalist" (a grandma in an apron) is a secondary target.
In a list of negative qualities, Enlisted Design said the old box looked outdated and noted that "affordability stirs questions about quality."
"It's the bulk and commodity mentality that drove this design, right?" said Miri Chan, Enlisted Design's vice president of branding and visual design. "It's very industrial looking."
When the agency presented a new one-pound package in variously shaped tins and boxes to 1,600 survey participants, they indicated they would pay between $ 5 and $ 7 for it.
This effectively moves the commodity salt -- which became known as koshering salt because it was used in generous portions to prepare meat in accordance with Jewish dietary law -- to a premium price point reserved for finishing salts that are meant to be used in small quantities, such as Maldon sea salt flakes.
According to Enlisted Design's case study, Cargill aims to increase the annual revenue from Diamond Crystal from $ 3 million to $ 50 million.
With crisp tomato-red borders and lettering with sharp serifs, the redesigned box now comes in three sizes: three pounds, 26 ounces and one pound, which has a window on the side so that new customers can see the product.
Sandra Krasovec, a packaging design professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, applauded the removal of heavy colors and outdated typography from the Diamond Crystal box, and its alignment with current packaging design trends: "calmer colors, geometric patterns, simplicity, minimalism."
The new box is labeled Diamond Crystal Salt Co., though the word "kosher" remains prominent in the design. "People are still looking for it," Ms. Chan said.
Executives at Cargill said consumers are often confused by what "kosher" means -- whether it refers to the type of salt, or if it's a religious distinction. (For Diamond Crystal, it's both.) The redesign emphasizes the grain type and texture, rather than its religious uses; the updated box also describes the salt as "flakes," a word used on the Maldon box. A Star of David, which has appeared in different forms on the box over time, is not on the new version. In a presentation to Cargill, Enlisted Design suggested that religious cues can limit "consumer range."
"Personally, I don't care what kind of box it comes in, as long as everyone cooking the food I eat knows how to find it," said Alana Newhouse, the author of "The 100 Most Jewish Foods."
While the makeover has landed Diamond Crystal national distribution at retailers like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, the salt inside the boxes is unchanged. The three-pound box is $ 12.99 on Amazon (compared with $ 8 five years ago) $ 8.99 at Trader Joe's, $ 10.29 at Whole Foods and $ 6.99 (before shipping) at the online restaurant supplier WebstaurantStore.
"Seeing the redesigned Diamond box in the supermarket was like running into an old friend who had too much work done. 'Is that you?"' said Carla Lalli Music, a cookbook author.
The new look threw off Ms. Vasan, the advertising strategist. She saw the salt in Trader Joe's and thought, "This is probably wrong," she said.
She went elsewhere to search for "the regular one."

Market Sobers, Pulling Back From Highs: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/market-sobers-pulling-back-highs/docview/2844475340/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street took a step back from its big rally so far this year, and most stocks fell Tuesday following a mixed set of earnings reports from U.S. companies.
The S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent, coming off its fifth straight winning month. The Nasdaq composite sank 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average squeezed out a gain of 0.2 percent even though most of the stocks within it weakened.
Travel-related stocks helped drag the market lower after they gave up some of their big gains from earlier in the year. Norwegian Cruise Line lost 12.1 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the spring than expected. Expectations have been high for it and rivals after its stock soared 80 percent for the year through Monday.
JetBlue Airways sank 8.3 percent to roughly halve its nearly 20 percent gain for the year through July, despite reporting better profit than expected for the latest quarter. It cut its forecast for results for the full year, partly because of the cancellation of a partnership with American Airlines
Worries have been broadly rising that expectations have built too high for the entire stock market after the S&P 500 surged more than 19 percent so far this year. Stocks had leaped to a 16-month high on hopes that inflation was cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. That in turn could allow the economy to avoid a long-expected recession.
While inflation has indeed come down since the summer and the economy has remained remarkably resilient, critics say it's no guarantee inflation will continue to cool at the same rate. They say stock prices have risen too far, too quickly.
Among other stocks that struggled with high expectations Tuesday was Molson Coors Beverage. It fell 4.7 percent after reporting weaker revenue for the spring than expected, even though its profit topped expectations.
Most companies so far this reporting season have beaten forecasts, but that's usually the case. And expectations were low coming into this season, with analysts calling for the worst decline in S&P 500 earnings per share in three years.
Among the winners on Wall Street Tuesday was Caterpillar. It rose 8.9 percent after blowing past analysts' forecasts for earnings during the spring. It was the stock pushing up the most on the Dow, where Caterpillar can have more of an impact than on the S&P 500 because of its big stock price.
Arista Networks jumped 19.7 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after it also beat expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter.
Reports on the economy Tuesday came in mixed. The number of job openings advertised across the country dipped slightly in June, when economists were expecting a rise. But the job market broadly remained solid, propping up the rest of the economy and keeping it out of a recession so far.
One report on the manufacturing industry from the Institute for Supply Management said it contracted at a slightly worse pace in July than economists expected, but not as badly as it did in June. A separate report from S&P Global also said manufacturing was continuing to decline.
"However, producers are clearly shrugging off recession fears and planning for better times ahead," said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Other profit reports scheduled for later in the week could have more of an impact. Amazon and Apple are scheduled to report on Thursday, and because they're two of the biggest stocks by market value, their movements pack more punch on the S&P 500 than other companies'. Both have also soared this year, along with other big tech stocks.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.04 percent from 3.97 percent late Monday.

Another Winning Month for the Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/another-winning-month-market/docview/2844002420/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed out its latest winning month with another tick higher on Monday.
The S&P 500 added 0.1 percent to cap its fifth straight month of gains. That is its longest winning streak in nearly two years, and the index is at a 16-month high after rallying on hopes cooling inflation will mean the economy can avoid a long-predicted recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2 percent.
To be sure, critics have been saying Wall Street's seemingly growing consensus for a soft landing for the economy has come too quickly. Several reports this week could poke holes in the theory that inflation will keep coming down enough for the Federal Reserve to not only stop raising interest rates but begin cutting them by early next year.
Big names in the market, such as Rob Arnott at Research Affiliates, are warning not to be "overly hasty in popping the champagne corks." Mr. Arnott sees the possibility of inflation rebounding again later this year, even though it's cooled considerably recently.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell himself has pointed to Friday's upcoming report on the overall job market as an important datapoint. Growth needs to be strong enough to keep a lid on worries about a possible recession. But a reading that's too hot could also mean upward pressure on inflation, which could push the Fed to get more aggressive about rates.
High rates undercut inflation by slowing the overall economy and dragging on prices for stocks and other investments. The Fed has already raised its main rate to its highest level in more than two decades, a jolting shock after the rate began last year at virtually zero.
Two of Wall Street's most influential stocks are also set to report their earnings for the spring. Amazon and Apple are both scheduled to release their latest quarterly results on Thursday. Because they're two of the biggest stocks on Wall Street, their stock movements pack much more punch for the S&P 500 and other indexes.
Both stocks have soared this year, in part on expectations for strong continued growth, and they'll need to deliver to justify the big moves. Both Apple and Amazon are up more than 50 percent this year.
Roughly halfway through the earnings reporting season, more companies than usual have topped analysts' profit expectations, according to FactSet. Companies also seem to be more optimistic about their upcoming results, giving better-than-expected forecasts more often than usual, according to strategists at Bank of America.
"While economic uncertainty remains, we believe the profit cycle is inflecting higher," the strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
ON Semiconductor rose 2.5 percent for one of the larger gains in the S&P 500 after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. The company, known as onsemi, also gave a forecast for profit in the current quarter that topped analysts' expectations.
On the losing end was Tempur Sealy International. The mattress company said it discovered a cybersecurity incident last week, which pushed it to shut down some of its technology systems. It has resumed operations after what it called a temporary interruption and is working to determine the full impact. Its stock fell 3 percent.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields slipped after a report suggested manufacturing in the Chicago region is weakening a bit more than economists expected. Manufacturing has been one of the hardest-hit areas in the economy by high interest rates, which work with a notoriously long lag effect.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 3.95 percent from 3.9 percent late Friday.

Heat Is Costing the U.S. Economy Billions in Lost Productivity

As much of the United States swelters under record heat, Amazon drivers and warehouse workers have gone on strike in part to protest working conditions that can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
On triple-digit days in Orlando, Florida, utility crews are postponing checks for gas leaks, since digging outdoors dressed in heavy safety gear could endanger their lives. Even in Michigan, on the nation’s northern border, construction crews are working shortened days because of heat.
Now that climate change has raised Earth’s temperatures to the highest levels in recorded history, with projections showing that they will only climb higher, new research shows the impact of heat on workers is spreading across the economy and lowering productivity.
Extreme heat is regularly affecting workers beyond expected industries such as agriculture and construction. Sizzling temperatures are causing problems for those who work in factories, warehouses and restaurants and also for employees of airlines and telecommunications firms, delivery services and energy companies. Even home health aides are running into trouble.
“We’ve known for a very long time that human beings are very sensitive to temperature, and that their performance declines dramatically when exposed to heat, but what we haven’t known until very recently is whether and how those lab responses meaningfully extrapolate to the real-world economy,” said R. Jisung Park, an environmental and labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania. “And what we are learning is that hotter temperatures appear to muck up the gears of the economy in many more ways than we would have expected.”
A study published in June on the effects of temperature on productivity concludes that although extreme heat harms agriculture, its impact is greater on industrial and other sectors of the economy, in part because they are more labor-intensive. It finds that heat increases absenteeism and reduces work hours, and concludes that as the planet continues to warm, those losses will increase.
The cost is high. In 2021, more than 2.5 billion hours of labor in the U.S. agriculture, construction, manufacturing and service sectors were lost to heat exposure, according to data compiled by The Lancet. Another report found that in 2020, the loss of labor as a result of heat exposure cost the economy about $100 billion, a figure projected to grow to $500 billion annually by 2050.
Other research found that as the mercury reaches 90 degrees, productivity slumps by about 25%, and when it goes past 100 degrees, productivity drops off by 70%.
And the effects are unequally distributed: In poor counties, workers lose as much as 5% of their pay with each hot day, researchers have found. In wealthy counties, the loss is less than 1%.
Of the many economic costs of climate change — dying crops, spiking insurance rates, flooded properties — the loss of productivity caused by heat is emerging as one of the biggest, experts say.
“We know that the impacts of climate change are costing the economy,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center and a former global executive for environmental and social risk at Bank of America. “The losses associated with people being hot at work, and the slowdowns and mistakes people make as a result are a huge part.”
Still, there are no national regulations to protect workers from extreme heat. In 2021, the Biden administration announced that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would propose the first rule designed to protect workers from heat exposure. But two years later, the agency still has not released a draft of the proposed regulation.
Seven states have some form of labor protections dealing with heat, but there has been a push to roll them back in some places. In June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law that eliminated rules set by municipalities that mandated water breaks for construction workers, even though Texas leads all states in terms of lost productivity linked to heat, according to an analysis of federal data conducted by Vivid Economics.
Business groups are opposed to a national standard, saying it would be too expensive because it would probably require rest, water and shade breaks and possibly the installation of air conditioning.
“OSHA should take care not to impose further regulatory burdens that make it more difficult for small businesses to grow their businesses and create jobs,” David Addington, vice president of the National Federation of Independent Business, wrote in response to OSHA’s plan to write a regulation.
Marc Freedman, vice president of employment policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, “I don’t think anyone is dismissing the hazard of overexposure to heat.” But, he said, “is an OSHA standard the right way to do it? A lot of employers are already taking measures, and the question will be: What more do they have to do?”
The National Beef slaughterhouse in Dodge City, Kansas, where temperatures are expected to hover above 100 degrees for the next week, is cooled by fans, not air conditioning.
Workers wear heavy protective aprons and helmets and use water vats and hoses heated to 180 degrees to sanitize their equipment. It has always been hot work.
But this year is different, said one worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. The heat inside the slaughterhouse is intense, drenching employees in sweat and making it hard to get through a shift, the worker said.
National Beef did not respond to emails or telephone calls requesting comment.
Martin Rosas, a union representative for meatpacking and food processing workers in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, said sweltering conditions present a risk for food contamination. After workers skin a hide, they need to ensure that debris doesn’t get on the meat or carcass. “But when it’s extremely hot, and their safety glasses fog up, their vision is impaired and they are exhausted, they can’t even see what they’re doing,” Rosas said.
Almost 200 employees out of roughly 2,500 have quit at the Dodge City National Beef plant since May, Rosas said. That’s about 10% higher than usual for that time period, he said.
But even some workers in air-conditioned settings are getting too hot. McDonald’s workers in Los Angeles walked off the job this summer as the air-conditioned kitchens were overwhelmed by the sweltering heat outside.
“There is an air conditioner in every part of the store, but the thermostat in the kitchen still showed it was over 100 degrees,” said Maria Rodriguez, who has worked at the same McDonald's on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles for 20 years but walked out July 21, sacrificing a day of pay. “It’s been hot before, but never like this summer. I felt terrible — like I could pass out or faint at any moment.”
Nicole Enearu, owner of the store, said in a statement, “We understand that there’s an uncomfortable heat wave in LA, which is why we’re even more focused on ensuring the safety of our employees inside our restaurants. Our air conditioning is functioning properly at this location.”
Tony Hedgepeth, a home health aide in Richmond, Virginia, cares for a client whose home thermostat is typically set at about 82 degrees. Last week, the temperature inside was near 94 degrees.
Any heat is a challenge in Hedgepeth’s job. “Bathing, cooking, lifting and moving him, cleaning him,” he said. “It’s all physical. It’s a lot of sweat.”
Warehouse workers across the country are also feeling the heat. Sersie Cobb, a forklift driver who stocks boxes of pasta in a warehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, said the stifling heat can make it difficult to breathe. “Sometimes I get dizzy and start seeing dots,” Cobb said. “My vision starts to go black. I stop work immediately when that happens. Two times this summer I’ve had heart palpitations from the heat, and left work early to go to the ER.”
In Southern California, a group of 84 striking Amazon delivery workers say that one of their priorities is getting the company to make it safe to work in extreme heat. Last month, unionized UPS workers won a victory when the company agreed to install air conditioning in delivery trucks.
“Heat has played a tremendous role — it was one of the major issues in the negotiations,” said Carthy Boston, a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters representing UPS drivers in Washington, D.C. “Those trucks are hotboxes.”
Many factories were built decades ago for a different climate and are not air-conditioned. A study on the effects of extreme temperatures on the productivity of auto plants in the United States found that a week with six or more days of heat exceeding 90 degrees cuts production by an average of 8%.
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Navistar is installing a $19 million air conditioning system at its IC Bus factory, which produces many of America’s school buses. Temperatures on the floor can reach 99 degrees. Currently, the plant is only cooled by overhead fans that swirl high above the assembly line.
Shane Anderson, the company’s interim manager, said air conditioning is expected to cost about $183 per hour, or between $275,000 and $500,000 per year — but the company believes it will boost worker productivity.
Other employers are also adapting.
Brad Maurer, vice president of Leidal and Hart, which builds stadiums, hospitals and factories in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, said managers now bring in pallets of bottled water, which they didn’t used to do, at a cost to the company of a few thousand dollars per month.
Rising heat around Detroit recently caused his employees to stop working three hours early on a Ford Motors facility for several days in a row — a pattern emerging throughout his company’s work sites.
“It means costs go up, production goes down, we may not meet schedules, and guys and women don’t get paychecks,” Maurer said.
Labor experts say that as employers adapt to the new reality of the changing climate, they will have to pay one way or the other.
“The truth is that the changes required probably will be very costly, and they will get passed on to employers and consumers,” said David Michaels, who served as assistant secretary of labor at OSHA during the Obama administration and is now a professor at the George Washington School of Public Health. “But if we don’t want these workers to get killed, we will have to pay that cost.”

Julian Barry, Who Made Lenny Bruce Into 'Lenny,' Is Dead at 92: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Barry's scripts for a hit Broadway play and later a Hollywood movie about that rule-breaking comic helped give Mr. Bruce a lasting place in pop culture lore.
Julian Barry, whose scripts for a Broadway play and a Hollywood movie about Lenny Bruce, both titled "Lenny," became definitive portraits of the comedian as a truth teller who drove himself mad in a righteous struggle against American hypocrisy, was found dead on Tuesday morning at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 92.
His daughter Julia Barry said he had died overnight in his sleep. He had been receiving medical treatment for congestive heart failure and, in recent weeks, for late-stage kidney disease.
Like Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon, Mr. Bruce died young (he was 40) and became a figure of continually renewed pop-culture lore. His comedy career and his criminal prosecutions on drug and obscenity charges inspired museum exhibitions, one-man theatrical performances and biographies. From 2017 until this year, a fictionalized version of Mr. Bruce was a recurring character on the Amazon Prime television show "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
Mr. Barry's play, which opened on Broadway in 1971, five years after Mr. Bruce's death, proved that Mr. Bruce could draw an audience posthumously. The 1974 movie version, which starred Dustin Hoffman in the title role, has endured as a classic of the Lenny Bruce mini-genre. It earned six Academy Award nominations, including for best picture, best actor and best adapted screenplay. (Mr. Barry lost to Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for "The Godfather Part II.")
In both scripts, Mr. Barry paid homage to Mr. Bruce by including lengthy passages of his stand-up comedic material. His Lenny Bruce is crude but winningly so -- more forgiving human frailty than mocking it, and skillful in using earthy common sense to attack the prejudices of his day.
Clive Barnes of The New York Times called the play a "dynamite shtick" of theater, and reflected on the irony that Mr. Bruce had been arrested after using language in nightclubs that by 1971 seemed unexceptional when declaimed from a Broadway stage. "The last laugh," he concluded, "is with Mr. Bruce."
The Broadway star of "Lenny," Cliff Gorman, won the 1972 Tony Award for lead actor in a play. As Mr. Gorman told The Times in an interview after the play opened, his performance roused Mr. Bruce's mother, Sally Marr, to visit his dressing room and address him as a "genius."
Mr. Barry's script compared Mr. Bruce to Aristophanes and Jonathan Swift. Some people rolled their eyes.
"The story Julian Barry has extracted from Bruce's life tends to sanctify and, in the end, even to solemnize Bruce rather than to explore his obsessions," another Times theater critic, Mel Gussow, wrote in a 1972 review, when Sandy Baron replaced Mr. Gorman.
But Mr. Barry found a powerful fan in Bob Fosse. After directing the movie version of the Broadway musical "Cabaret" (1972), for which he won the Academy Award for best director, Mr. Fosse decided that he wanted "Lenny" to be his next film project. He hired Mr. Barry to write the script.
"In the play, I mythologized Lenny Bruce," Mr. Barry told Rolling Stone in 1974. In contrast, he said, the movie offered "a cold, objective approach."
Mr. Barry was perhaps referring to the film's depiction of Mr. Bruce's decline -- ranting onstage about his arrests, shooting heroin, speechifying pathetically in court and finally dying of a morphine overdose naked on his bathroom floor in Los Angeles.
Yet in "Lenny," filmed in arty black and white, Mr. Bruce's flaws are redeemed. He cheats on his wife, but he shows himself to be faithful to her when she needs him most. His idealism about racial slurs -- that by using them people can sap them of their malign power -- goes unquestioned. His enemies in the legal system do not explain their defense of conservative social mores.
Mr. Barry saw Mr. Bruce as a tragic hero.
"The whole beauty of Lenny," he told Rolling Stone, "is his message: We're all the same schmuck."
Julian Barry Mendelsohn Jr. was born on Dec. 24, 1930, in the Bronx and grew up in the Riverdale neighborhood. His father struggled as a salesman during the Depression but eventually rose to become an executive at the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company. His mother, Grace (Fein) Mendelsohn, donated time and money to Jewish causes and the theater.
Julian began acting as a teenager while attending Horace Mann, a day school in Riverdale, where, he wrote in his memoir, "My Night With Orson" (2011), he was a "townie" -- not as privileged as wealthier fellow students who lived in uptown Manhattan. Believing it would aid a future career in show business -- and following the advice of Philip Burton, a British director who taught at a summer acting camp that Julian attended -- he modified his name to sound less Jewish while still just a teenager.
He was briefly an undergraduate at Syracuse University and Emerson College in Massachusetts. After serving in the Army and fighting in Korea in his early 20s, he established a career as a Broadway stage manager. He then took a risk at the age of 35, turning down steady work to focus on writing.
Mr. Barry found success in television writing scripts in the 1960s for popular shows like "Mission: Impossible." His first screenplay to be filmed was "Rhinoceros" (1974), an adaptation of Eugène Ionesco's play, starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.
Mr. Barry's four marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Julia, from his third marriage, to the film producer Laura Ziskin, he is survived by his longtime partner, Samantha Harper Macy; two daughters, Sally and Jennifer Barry, from his second marriage, to Patricia Foley; a son, Michael, also from that marriage; five grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
In his autobiography, Mr. Barry described years of meeting stars and starlets. He and Frank Sinatra spent hours telling old stories and imagining a movie they might make together.
Summing up his life in the mid-1980s, he wrote, "I was still bumming a ride on my Academy nomination."
Yet project after project of his did not get made, lost in the Hollywood purgatory known as "development."
To some extent, Mr. Barry wrote, it was his own fault for becoming too hip for his own good. He grew his hair long, and he name-dropped in the offhand style of a "Hollywood Phony," he wrote. Discussing a script of his with Robert Redford and the director Sydney Pollack in Mr. Redford's hotel room, he suddenly lit up a joint. He was later told that the two men did not like him.
"I had to live up to my reputation," Mr. Barry recalled, "as the man who wrote about Lenny Bruce."

Scouting Out The Next Wave Of Robot Workers: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The long-anticipated automation revolution has begun. Robots are ready to operate forklifts and do laundry. It's not as scary as it sounds.
Digit drew a crowd, even here, in a convention center full of robot aficionados.
A humanoid warehouse worker, Digit walked upright on goatlike legs and grabbed bins off a shelf with muscular arms made from aerospace-grade aluminum. It then placed the boxes on an assembly line and walked back to the shelf to search for more. The crowd, which had assembled at ProMat, the premier trade show for the manufacturing and supply chain industry, held up phones and watched, a little quiet, wondering if at some point the robot would teeter and fall. It did not.
Digit, made by Oregon-based Agility Robotics, is the kind of technology that people have worried about for generations: a machine with the strength and adroitness to rival our own, and the ability to take our jobs, or much worse. Then ChatGPT came online, and suddenly the fear was of something smarter rather than stronger -- malevolent bots rather than metallic brutes.
The automaton is still coming. It might not be ready to take over the Amazon warehouse yet, but the long-anticipated robot revolution has begun, accelerated in large part by the pandemic and the thunderous growth of e-commerce. Machines like Digit are ready to take over a vast swath of physical labor, from operating forklifts to doing the laundry.
Ron Kyslinger thinks this is a good thing. Mr. Kyslinger, an engineer who has spearheaded automation for some of the largest retailers in the world, including Amazon and Walmart, is passionate about the potential of robots to improve the quality of life for workers. Robots free humans from boredom, repetition, physical strain and productivity limits that can put their jobs at risk, he believes. He also believes that Americans have a prejudice against automation because of movies like "The Terminator," inhibiting them from adapting to technology in ways both beneficial and inevitable.
Mr. Kyslinger, 56, is currently a consultant for companies hoping to increase automation, and his services are in high demand. Known for his ability to see the big picture not just in a warehouse full of whirring machines but across the global landscape of automation, he is blunt and methodical, and can be somewhat robotic himself in his personal manner. He is often hired to diagnose problems and tell a board or chief executive how it really is.
And how it really is right now, in Mr. Kyslinger's opinion, is that the world is on the brink of enormous changes when it comes to the presence of robots at work.
"I don't think people really understand where we are," he told me. "We're just scratching the surface."
Use of robots by big brands, retailers and movers of goods accelerated significantly after 2019. According to the Association for Advancing Automation, robot orders in North America jumped 42 percent during the pandemic after essentially being flat over the previous five years.
The shift has taken place largely out of sight, inside an archipelago of windowless warehouses across the Southeast and Midwest, helping companies to avoid inflaming the taboo against replacing human workers with machines. Some are reluctant to even discuss automation.
Americans have long felt ambivalent toward automation. The country that invented such job-killers as the dishwasher and the combine also produced the likes of Philip K. Dick and James Cameron, artists whose dystopian visions helped breed lasting anxiety toward robots.
Over the last few years, significant resources have been thrown at making robots profitable -- and this is paying off. More companies are competing to solve the problems that have traditionally come with automation, and many are succeeding.
"People are finally making money," said Samuel Reeves, chief executive of FORT Robotics, a Philadelphia start-up focused on robot safety. "You've got legit work being done by mobile autonomous robots. And that's only in the past two or three years."
Interest skyrocketed during the pandemic and helped create relatively low-cost automation systems that companies can install very quickly, said Ash Sharma, managing director of Interact Analysis, which surveys trends in automation.
"We've seen billions of dollars flying into this sector," he said.
Yet the use of robots in most countries remains relatively low, suggesting that a true reckoning with their social impact lies ahead.
The United States ranked ninth in robot density in 2021, down from seventh in 2020, according to the International Federation of Robotics. By contrast, in East Asia, where the aging of populations has long bred fears of worker shortages, robots have been embraced.
The United States has its own problems with aging workers, however, especially in heavy industries like manufacturing, where baby boomers form an outsize part of the work force.
"The pandemic took somewhere between one and a half to three million people out of work," said Joseph Campbell, senior marketing manager for Universal Robots. "A lot of boomers who were planning to work past 65 said 62 is good enough. It's scary."
If a transition to a robotic work force is underway, managing it is likely to fall to a small group of industry veterans such as Mr. Kyslinger. Almost 20 years ago, he was one of a small number of robot boosters who built the paradigm, and to see it today through his eyes is to see where it may be headed next.
He has his concerns -- about people, not robots.
In it for 'what's best for humanity'
At ProMat, which took place over four days in March inside Chicago's McCormick Place convention center, Digit was the undisputed star. The scene looked, for the most part, like a kid-friendly science fiction movie, a robot bazaar where the machines move slowly, say excuse me and execute limited tasks like picking up objects and dropping them.
However, some robots sat inside plexiglass cages. "You don't want to go in there," Mr. Kyslinger said, pointing at one. "That thing will knock you on your butt."
ProMat's 51,000 attendees -- a glad-handing throng of well-groomed, middle-aged white male faces attached to monogrammed backpacks and fancy sneakers -- ambled from one exhibit to the next like visitors at a zoo. The crowd included buyers from major retailers and consumer goods companies, as well as venture capitalists and engineers.
At one booth for a robot "picker," I told one of the few women seemingly within miles that I was writing an article about a guy named Ron. "Oh, really," she said, looking fatigued. "There are a lot of Rons here."
Mr. Kyslinger floated through this milieu like a celebrity entering a restaurant, barely able to move without being accosted. "Welcome to Ron's world," one attendee whispered to me above the whine of micro-motors. "Ron's the O.G. of automation," another said. Mr. Kyslinger blushed at the attention.
"I don't love talking about me," he said a bit gruffly. He had agreed to share his passion for and concerns about automation in the interest of "what's best for humanity."
Mr. Kyslinger, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and was a curveball-throwing right-hander for the University of Pittsburgh, majored in computer science in college. Practice was at 5 a.m., so he got up at 3:30 and went to the computer lab.
After graduating in 1989, he went into the automotive world, where, starting as a controls engineer, he spent 23 years working for Chrysler, Ford and Honda. Car companies were among the first to embrace automation, replacing humans with crude, often dangerous robots on assembly lines.
In the 1980s, robots were a rare example of the U.S. car industry's using technology to think ahead. But in some ways, industry experts believe, they set robotics back.
"Everything we sold was to take labor out," said Mr. Campbell of Universal Robots. "Everything was to replace a worker. That was the impression, and at that point it was the truth."
For Mr. Kyslinger, who today lives near Myrtle Beach, S.C., working for a Japanese car company was a formative experience. He admired what he saw as Japanese culture's disciplined approach to complex problems and wrote a master's thesis on the different working environments at Honda and Ford.
In 2011, Mr. Kyslinger moved to an industry trying even more aggressively to automate industrial workspaces: food distribution. At C&S Wholesale Grocers, the nation's largest grocery distributor, he designed a warehouse in which robots traveling 30 miles per hour filled up pallets destined for supermarkets.
C&S is a little-known company that has a hand in transporting an outsized portion of the nation's food. ("If it belongs on a supermarket shelf, it's probably moving through a C&S warehouse right now," the New Hampshire-based company likes to say.) Under Mr. Kyslinger, C&S pioneered warehouses with so few human workers that they came close to the industry goal of "lights out," meaning the ability to operate in darkness, minus human eyes.
Today Mr. Kyslinger says lights out is "getting really close." As we walked the floor of Promat, he identified robots that were closing the gap with humans and in some cases outperforming them.
Squashing Q-Tips
On the whole, Mr. Kyslinger is not easily impressed. He called the robot trade show full of "bits and pieces of the future -- many parts make my brain hurt."
Nevertheless, somewhat begrudgingly, he pointed out some highlights: A robotic arm with a kind of gripper that approached the versatility of human fingers. A visual sensor that had made progress in discerning the glare on a plastic wrapper from an object it contained. A sorter that excelled at finding the ideal geometry inside a cardboard box for items of different shapes, whether "toothpaste, tuna fish or a teddy bear."
Mr. Kyslinger seemed more interested in explaining what robots can't do. As a former computer programmer, he was decidedly unfazed by ChatGPT, the chatbot powered by artificial intelligence.
"People are looking for it to be the Holy Grail," he said, "but it's only as good as the people who programmed it."
At another booth, we watched a "cobot" -- short for collaborative robot -- as it placed items inside a droid-like "autonomous mobile robot" zipping to and fro. Cobots are supposed to be harmless, but this machine's Japanese manufacturer, Fanuc, a longtime provider of robotic arms to carmakers, had put it inside a cage anyway.
Its writhing octopus-like appendages were hypnotic, but as soon as we started watching it, one of its "end effectors" (robot-speak for hands) failed to grip a box of Q-Tips and dropped it on the floor, where the autonomous mobile robot ran over it.
"See?" Mr. Kyslinger said. The cobot was shut down so an attendant could enter the cage and remove the now-flattened Q-Tips. Mr. Kyslinger called this not a defect but an "edge case," the kind of routine mistake that makes human intervention inevitable. It showed why getting to "lights out" in e-commerce will be a struggle.
"They probably taught the robot how to do this thousands of times in their lab," he said. "Then they bring it out here and it still misses."
We walked on, with Mr. Kyslinger being greeted at every turn. At one booth he stopped in his tracks. By now we had passed robotic lift trucks stacking boxes, robot sentry dogs with thermal and acoustic sensors, and robots unloading trailers. (At Automate, another industry event, we watched a Fanuc robotic arm twirl around 2,200-pound objects as if they were pizzas.) None of those moments, however, really made Mr. Kyslinger's pupils widen.
"That catches my eye," he suddenly said. It was a Shelby Cobra, made in 1967 and retrofitted for racing. A car.
'Fear of our own creation'
One of Mr. Kyslinger's many consulting clients wandering the ProMat floor was Samuel Reeves, a roboticist from Philadelphia. Mr. Reeves, now 40, began working on a company he called Humanistic Robotics in the mid-2000s, shortly after he graduated from college. It was devoted to land mine removal, the kind of extreme task that robots have long been assigned. Humanistic Robots used a construction vehicle to build a 10,000-pound minesweeping robot that could move on its own.
"And we were immediately terrified of it," Mr. Reeves said. He then founded FORT Robotics, "born of our fear of our own creation." He expressed the same kind of terror and regret that artificial intelligence creators have been voicing.
FORT Robotics is a "robotic-controlled platform," according to Mr. Reeves, and one of only a few companies focused on preventing robots from mauling workers, which Mr. Reeves called "a disaster waiting to happen."
"In the last generation of automation, people were just really trying to get machines out there that worked," Mr. Reeves said. "There have to be huge innovations to improve safety so that machines can run autonomously and faster around humans -- and at a lower price point." He added that "safety-rated scanners are incredibly expensive -- like $ 10,000 a pop."
Mr. Kyslinger echoed Mr. Reeves's concerns.
"I've seen robots go horribly wrong," he told me. In one warehouse owned by a company he advised, a robot essentially clobbered a worker, breaking several bones. A technician had accidentally disabled its safety features.
"Human error causes problems, not robot error," Mr. Kyslinger said, noting that airplane crashes have declined sharply since autopilot was introduced. "The robot does what it's told to do -- no more, no less."
"People think of 'The Terminator,"' he added, "but that stuff can't happen when you have safety protocols." Such protocols can include "bifurcating" a robot's safety controls so that two humans would have to agree to the sort of change that would put workers near the robot at risk.
Safety concerns have made cobots one of the fastest-growing segments of industrial automation. A cobot "can hit you, but it can't hurt you," Mr. Kyslinger said. "It knows you're there. It senses you're there and stops."
Robots show up
In 2018, before the pandemic unleashed a torrent of pressure on companies to automate, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology commissioned a task force on "The Work of the Future."
The task force concluded that "no compelling evidence suggests that technological advances are driving us toward a jobless future." On the contrary, it anticipated "more job openings than workers to fill them." Nevertheless, it argued, "the implications of robotics and automation for workers will not be benign."
"The pandemic laid bare vulnerabilities that have come from hollowing out U.S. manufacturing capabilities," said one of the task force's co-chairs, Elisabeth Reynolds, an M.I.T. lecturer who went on to serve as a special assistant for manufacturing and economic development on the National Economic Council. "Automation is going to help us make the transition to an advanced manufacturing center, while helping with a long-term shortage of workers."
Another co-chair, Prof. David Mindell, agreed, calling the recent changes potentially positive for workers but only if the widespread incorporation of robots leads to the creation of "new industries and new kinds of jobs."
"Sixty percent of the jobs in the Department of Labor database did not exist in 1940," Mr. Mindell said over Zoom. "You know, web designer, massage therapist, dog walker, aerodynamic simulations engineer. We have to make sure that we're continuing to create those kinds of jobs."
At ProMat, Mr. Kyslinger and I eventually came to Digit, the humanoid warehouse worker. We watched Digit work itself into a crouch so it could pick up a bin near the floor.
"You don't want people bending over to lift from down there," Mr. Kyslinger said. "That's where injuries occur, in their backs, in their necks."
Still, the machine was moving slowly -- slower than most humans. Mr. Kyslinger studied its movements, seemingly unimpressed. "A lot of algorithms go into that," he said. "Humans do those things without even thinking."
But, he added, to be an improvement over humans, machines don't need to be faster.
"Robots show up every day," he said.

Digit drew a crowd, even here, in a convention center full of robot aficionados.
A humanoid warehouse worker, Digit walked upright on goatlike legs and grabbed bins off a shelf with muscular arms made from aerospace-grade aluminum. It then placed the boxes on an assembly line and walked back to the shelf to search for more. The crowd, which had assembled at ProMat, the premier trade show for the manufacturing and supply chain industry, held up phones and watched, a little quiet, wondering if at some point the robot would teeter and fall. It did not.
Digit, made by Oregon-based Agility Robotics, is the kind of technology that people have worried about for generations: a machine with the strength and adroitness to rival our own, and the ability to take our jobs, or much worse. Then ChatGPT came online, and suddenly the fear was of something smarter rather than stronger — malevolent bots rather than metallic brutes.
The automaton is still coming. It might not be ready to take over the Amazon warehouse yet, but the long-anticipated robot revolution has begun, accelerated in large part by the pandemic and the thunderous growth of e-commerce. Machines like Digit are ready to take over a vast swath of physical labor, from operating forklifts to doing the laundry.
Ron Kyslinger thinks this is a good thing. Kyslinger, an engineer who has spearheaded automation for some of the largest retailers in the world, including Amazon and Walmart, is passionate about the potential of robots to improve the quality of life for workers. Robots free humans from boredom, repetition, physical strain and productivity limits that can put their jobs at risk, he believes. He also believes that Americans have a prejudice against automation because of movies like “The Terminator,” inhibiting them from adapting to technology in ways both beneficial and inevitable.
Kyslinger, 56, is currently a consultant for companies hoping to increase automation, and his services are in high demand. Known for his ability to see the big picture not just in a warehouse full of whirring machines but across the global landscape of automation, he is blunt and methodical, and can be somewhat robotic himself in his personal manner. He is often hired to diagnose problems and tell a board or CEO how it really is.
And how it really is right now, in Kyslinger’s opinion, is that the world is on the brink of enormous changes when it comes to the presence of robots at work.
“I don’t think people really understand where we are,” he told me. “We’re just scratching the surface.”
Use of robots by big brands, retailers and movers of goods accelerated significantly after 2019. According to the Association for Advancing Automation, robot orders in North America jumped 42% during the pandemic after essentially being flat over the previous five years.
The shift has taken place largely out of sight, inside an archipelago of windowless warehouses across the Southeast and Midwest, helping companies to avoid inflaming the taboo against replacing human workers with machines. Some are reluctant to even discuss automation.
Americans have long felt ambivalent toward automation. The country that invented such job-killers as the dishwasher and the combine also produced the likes of Philip K. Dick and James Cameron, artists whose dystopian visions helped breed lasting anxiety toward robots.
Over the last few years, significant resources have been thrown at making robots profitable — and this is paying off. More companies are competing to solve the problems that have traditionally come with automation, and many are succeeding.
“People are finally making money,” said Samuel Reeves, CEO of FORT Robotics, a Philadelphia startup focused on robot safety. “You’ve got legit work being done by mobile autonomous robots. And that’s only in the past two or three years.”
Interest skyrocketed during the pandemic and helped create relatively low-cost automation systems that companies can install very quickly, said Ash Sharma, managing director of Interact Analysis, which surveys trends in automation.
“We’ve seen billions of dollars flying into this sector,” he said.
Yet the use of robots in most countries remains relatively low, suggesting that a true reckoning with their social impact lies ahead.
The United States ranked ninth in robot density in 2021, down from seventh in 2020, according to the International Federation of Robotics. By contrast, in East Asia, where the aging of populations has long bred fears of worker shortages, robots have been embraced.
The United States has its own problems with aging workers, however, especially in heavy industries like manufacturing, where baby boomers form an outsize part of the workforce.
“The pandemic took somewhere between 1 1/2 to 3 million people out of work,” said Joseph Campbell, senior marketing manager for Universal Robots. “A lot of boomers who were planning to work past 65 said 62 is good enough. It’s scary.”
If a transition to a robotic workforce is underway, managing it is likely to fall to a small group of industry veterans such as Kyslinger. Almost 20 years ago, he was one of a small number of robot boosters who built the paradigm, and to see it today through his eyes is to see where it may be headed next.
He has his concerns — about people, not robots.
‘What’s Best for Humanity’
At ProMat, which took place over four days in March inside Chicago’s McCormick Place convention center, Digit was the undisputed star. The scene looked, for the most part, like a kid-friendly science fiction movie, a robot bazaar where the machines move slowly, say excuse me and execute limited tasks like picking up objects and dropping them.
However, some robots sat inside plexiglass cages. “You don’t want to go in there,” Kyslinger said, pointing at one. “That thing will knock you on your butt.”
ProMat’s 51,000 attendees — a glad-handing throng of well-groomed, middle-aged white male faces attached to monogrammed backpacks and fancy sneakers — ambled from one exhibit to the next like visitors at a zoo. The crowd included buyers from major retailers and consumer goods companies, as well as venture capitalists and engineers.
At one booth for a robot “picker,” I told one of the few women seemingly within miles that I was writing an article about a guy named Ron. “Oh, really,” she said, looking fatigued. “There are a lot of Rons here.”
Kyslinger floated through this milieu like a celebrity entering a restaurant, barely able to move without being accosted. “Welcome to Ron’s world,” one attendee whispered to me above the whine of micro-motors. “Ron’s the OG of automation,” another said. Kyslinger blushed at the attention.
“I don’t love talking about me,” he said a bit gruffly. He had agreed to share his passion for and concerns about automation in the interest of “what’s best for humanity.”
Kyslinger, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and was a curveball-throwing right-hander for the University of Pittsburgh, majored in computer science in college. Practice was at 5 a.m., so he got up at 3:30 and went to the computer lab.
After graduating in 1989, he went into the automotive world, where, starting as a controls engineer, he spent 23 years working for Chrysler, Ford and Honda. Car companies were among the first to embrace automation, replacing humans with crude, often dangerous robots on assembly lines.
In the 1980s, robots were a rare example of the U.S. car industry’s using technology to think ahead. But in some ways, industry experts believe, they set robotics back.
“Everything we sold was to take labor out,” said Campbell of Universal Robots. “Everything was to replace a worker. That was the impression, and at that point it was the truth.”
For Kyslinger, who today lives near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, working for a Japanese car company was a formative experience. He admired what he saw as Japanese culture’s disciplined approach to complex problems and wrote a master’s thesis on the different working environments at Honda and Ford.
In 2011, Kyslinger moved to an industry trying even more aggressively to automate industrial workspaces: food distribution. At C&S Wholesale Grocers, the nation’s largest grocery distributor, he designed a warehouse in which robots traveling 30 mph filled up pallets destined for supermarkets.
C&S is a little-known company that has a hand in transporting an outsized portion of the nation’s food. (“If it belongs on a supermarket shelf, it’s probably moving through a C&S warehouse right now,” the New Hampshire-based company likes to say.) Under Kyslinger, C&S pioneered warehouses with so few human workers that they came close to the industry goal of “lights out,” meaning the ability to operate in darkness, minus human eyes.
Today Kyslinger says lights out is “getting really close.” As we walked the floor of ProMat, he identified robots that were closing the gap with humans and in some cases outperforming them.
Squashing Q-Tips
On the whole, Kyslinger is not easily impressed. He called the robot trade show full of “bits and pieces of the future — many parts make my brain hurt.”
Nevertheless, somewhat begrudgingly, he pointed out some highlights: A robotic arm with a kind of gripper that approached the versatility of human fingers. A visual sensor that had made progress in discerning the glare on a plastic wrapper from an object it contained. A sorter that excelled at finding the ideal geometry inside a cardboard box for items of different shapes, whether “toothpaste, tuna fish or a teddy bear.”
Kyslinger seemed more interested in explaining what robots can’t do. As a former computer programmer, he was decidedly unfazed by ChatGPT, the chatbot powered by artificial intelligence.
“People are looking for it to be the Holy Grail,” he said, “but it’s only as good as the people who programmed it.”
At another booth, we watched a “cobot” — short for collaborative robot — as it placed items inside a droid-like “autonomous mobile robot” zipping to and fro. Cobots are supposed to be harmless, but this machine’s Japanese manufacturer, Fanuc, a longtime provider of robotic arms to carmakers, had put it inside a cage anyway.
Its writhing octopus-like appendages were hypnotic, but as soon as we started watching it, one of its “end effectors” (robot-speak for hands) failed to grip a box of Q-Tips and dropped it on the floor, where the autonomous mobile robot ran over it.
“See?” Kyslinger said. The cobot was shut down so an attendant could enter the cage and remove the now-flattened Q-Tips. Kyslinger called this not a defect but an “edge case,” the kind of routine mistake that makes human intervention inevitable. It showed why getting to “lights out” in e-commerce will be a struggle.
“They probably taught the robot how to do this thousands of times in their lab,” he said. “Then they bring it out here and it still misses.”
We walked on, with Kyslinger being greeted at every turn. At one booth he stopped in his tracks. By now we had passed robotic lift trucks stacking boxes, robot sentry dogs with thermal and acoustic sensors, and robots unloading trailers. (At Automate, another industry event, we watched a Fanuc robotic arm twirl around 2,200-pound objects as if they were pizzas.) None of those moments, however, really made Kyslinger’s pupils widen.
“That catches my eye,” he said. It was a Shelby Cobra, made in 1967 and retrofitted for racing. A car.
‘Fear of Our Own Creation’
One of Kyslinger’s many consulting clients wandering the ProMat floor was Samuel Reeves, a roboticist from Philadelphia. Reeves, now 40, began working on a company he called Humanistic Robotics in the mid-2000s, shortly after he graduated from college. It was devoted to land mine removal, the kind of extreme task that robots have long been assigned. Humanistic Robots used a construction vehicle to build a 10,000-pound minesweeping robot that could move on its own.
“And we were immediately terrified of it,” Reeves said. He then founded FORT Robotics, “born of our fear of our own creation.” He expressed the same kind of terror and regret that artificial intelligence creators have been voicing.

Quixotic Quest to Turn X Into an 'Everything App': [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mr. Musk, the owner of Twitter, is the latest Silicon Valley mogul to pursue an all-in-one app, the kind that has thrived in Asia but not elsewhere.
Four years ago, a billionaire tech executive leading one of the world's pre-eminent social platforms laid out a vision to transform it into an app that could do it all. In an online manifesto, he wrote that the app would not only be central to written communications but have audio, video, payments, commerce and more.
The idea was akin to that of an "everything app" espoused recently by Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter. But the dream belonged to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In a 2019 blog post, Mr. Zuckerberg outlined how he would turn WhatsApp into an app that could be a platform for many "kinds of private services."
In Silicon Valley, the pursuit of an everything app has come up time and again as tech leaders have strained to expand their digital empires. Mr. Zuckerberg tried it. So did Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber. Evan Spiegel, the head of Snap, said he wanted to go for it, too.
Yet those efforts fell short, with the tech executives unable to replicate the magic that has abounded in Asia with "super apps" like China's WeChat, Japan's Line and South Korea's KakaoTalk. U.S. tech giants have instead run into cultural differences, regulatory scrutiny and a splintered financial system that has made the quest to build such apps more difficult.
And now Mr. Musk, who this week changed Twitter's name to X, the moniker for his everything app, is chasing the same goal -- and is likely to face the same challenges.
In the United States, people are "accustomed to single-service apps, which makes moving to a multiservice app a bit disorienting," said Dan Prud'homme, an assistant professor of business at Florida International University. "To some extent, U.S. customers don't like feeling that they are too beholden to a single firm for their everyday needs."
Mr. Musk has been enamored with an everything app since at least last year. Weeks before closing his $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October, he tweeted that his purchase would be "an accelerant to creating X, the everything app."
On Monday, he tweeted about Twitter's rebranding to X, writing: "In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird."
Yet Mr. Musk has said little publicly about what his everything app would look like, how it would function or why people would want to use it. In November, Twitter filed paperwork with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to become a payments processor, and employees have been building a payments service.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
His plan faces many doubters. He has "taken a wrecking ball to Twitter" and undermined how people use the platform, said Chris Messina, a tech entrepreneur and the creator of the hashtag. "It seems as if he's going to build a grab bag of different functions and ram it through the user base."
Much of the desire to create an everything app is rooted in Asia, where such apps have flourished for more than a decade. In Japan, people use Line, the country's dominant messaging platform, to store vaccination cards and shop for clothes. In South Korea, people turn to KakaoTalk, which started as a messaging service, to send money and request taxi rides.
None have been as successful as Tencent's WeChat, a messaging, social media and payments app used by more than one billion people, mostly in China. WeChat dominates the mobile internet and is a one-stop shop to read news, talk with friends, order pizza or pay the landlord.
Many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have long considered WeChat the gold standard for mobile apps.
"If you go to China, you see how much easier everything is, and you say, 'I wish I had that for myself,"' said Ted Livingston, the founder of the messaging platform Kik, which is backed by Tencent. "WeChat is effectively the operating system of daily life in China."
In 2013, Snap's Mr. Spiegel also referred to Tencent as a model when it came to making money. In an interview last year with Axios, he spoke glowingly of Tencent's continued success with WeChat and said Snap was also building a "Snapchat super app." Tencent has invested in Snap, most recently in 2017.
In 2019, following Uber's initial public offering, Mr. Khosrowshahi echoed the super app mantra. He said he saw his ride-hailing app as the "Amazon of transportation" and wanted it to be the "operating system for your everyday life in a city."
That same year, Mr. Zuckerberg stated similar ambitions for WhatsApp. Mr. Zuckerberg has since added payment and commerce features to Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, though none have become an everything app.
That may come down to different regulatory and cultural environments, Mr. Messina, the entrepreneur, said. U.S. tech giants have come under heightened antitrust scrutiny from regulators around the world, but Chinese tech companies that have Beijing's blessing have flourished, even amid a crackdown on tech power.
In November, Mr. Musk was asked at a companywide meeting at Twitter about his everything app idea, two people who attended the event said. An employee noted that there were fundamental differences between Twitter and Tencent, the people said.
Mr. Musk responded that the questioner didn't know what he was talking about, before asking for the next question, the two attendees said.
Mr. Musk has not held back on his predictions for X. "If done right," he said in a recent podcast interview, X could become "half of the global financial system."
Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's chief executive, has also appeared enthusiastic about X.
"X is the future state of unlimited interactivity -- centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking -- creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities," she tweeted on Sunday. "Powered by A.I., X will connect us all in ways we're just beginning to imagine."

Profit Reports Fuel a Wall Street Rally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street's rally got back on track Friday following more encouraging profit reports and the latest signal that inflation is loosening its chokehold on the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to its highest close in more than 15 months. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 176 points, or 0.5 percent after breaking a 13-day winning streak the day before. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.9 percent as Big Tech stocks led the market.
Stocks have been rising recently on hopes high inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to stop hiking interest rates. That in turn could allow the economy to continue growing and avoid a long-predicted recession. The S&P 500 closed out its third straight winning week and its ninth in the last 11.
A report on Friday bolstered those hopes, saying the inflation measure the Fed prefers to use slowed last month by a touch more than expected. Perhaps just as importantly, data also showed that total compensation for workers rose less than expected during the spring. While that's discouraging for workers looking for bigger raises, investors see it adding less upward pressure on inflation.
The hope among traders is that the slowdown in inflation means the Federal Reserve's hike to interest rates on Wednesday will be the final one of this cycle. The federal funds rate has leaped to a level between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, up from virtually zero early last year. High interest rates work to lower inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Critics, though, say the stock market's rally may have gone too far, too fast. The full effects of the Fed's rate hikes have yet to make their way fully through the system. Other parts of the economy could still crack under the pressure, like the three U.S. bank failures this spring that shook confidence. Plus, inflation remains above the Fed's target level, and the central bank could have to keep the brakes on the economy a while to get it down to target.
"Don't underestimate central bank commitment to 2 percent inflation," Bank of America economists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
Still, hopes for a halt to rate hikes helped technology stocks and others seen as big beneficiaries from easier rates to rally and lead the market Friday.
Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose at least 1.4 percent and were the three strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.
Companies also continued to deliver stronger profits for the spring than analysts expected. Roughly halfway through the earnings season, more companies than usual are topping profit forecasts, according to FactSet.
Intel rose 6.6 percent after reporting a profit for the latest quarter, when analysts were expecting a loss.
Food giant Mondelez International climbed 3.7 percent after reporting stronger results for the spring than expected. The company behind Oreo and Ritz also raised its forecasts for financial results for the full year.
On the losing end was Exxon Mobil. It fell 1.2 percent and was the heaviest single weight on the S&P 500. It reported weaker profit for the spring than expected, though its revenue topped forecasts.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 44.82 points to 4,582.23. The Dow added 176.57 to 35,459.29, and the Nasdaq jumped 265.55 to 14,316.66.
In stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 percent after the Bank of Japan made moves that could allow longer-term interest rates to rise. Stocks rose in China and were modestly higher across Europe.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.95 percent from 4.00 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.

Elon Musk’s Quixotic Quest to Turn X Into an ‘Everything App’

LOS ANGELES — Four years ago, a billionaire tech executive leading one of the world’s preeminent social platforms laid out a vision to transform it into an app that could do it all. In an online manifesto, he wrote that the app would not only be central to written communications but have audio, video, payments, commerce and more.
The idea was akin to that of an “everything app” espoused recently by Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter. But the dream belonged to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In a 2019 blog post, Zuckerberg outlined how he would turn WhatsApp into an app that could be a platform for many “kinds of private services.”
In Silicon Valley, the pursuit of an everything app has come up time and again as tech leaders have strained to expand their digital empires. Zuckerberg tried it. So did Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber. Evan Spiegel, the head of Snap, said he wanted to go for it, too.
Yet those efforts fell short, with the tech executives unable to replicate the magic that has abounded in Asia with “super apps” like China’s WeChat, Japan’s Line and South Korea’s KakaoTalk. U.S. tech giants have instead run into cultural differences, regulatory scrutiny and a splintered financial system that has made the quest to build such apps more difficult.
And now Musk, who this week changed Twitter’s name to X, the moniker for his everything app, is chasing the same goal — and is likely to face the same challenges.
In the United States, people are “accustomed to single-service apps, which makes moving to a multiservice app a bit disorienting,” said Dan Prud’homme, an assistant professor of business at Florida International University. “To some extent, U.S. customers don’t like feeling that they are too beholden to a single firm for their everyday needs.”
Musk has been enamored with an everything app since at least last year. Weeks before closing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October, he tweeted that his purchase would be “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.”
On Monday, he tweeted about Twitter’s rebranding to X, writing: “In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird.”
Yet Musk has said little publicly about what his everything app would look like, how it would function or why people would want to use it. In November, Twitter filed paperwork with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to become a payments processor, and employees have been building a payments service.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
His plan faces many doubters. He has “taken a wrecking ball to Twitter” and undermined how people use the platform, said Chris Messina, a tech entrepreneur and the creator of the hashtag. “It seems as if he’s going to build a grab bag of different functions and ram it through the user base.”
Much of the desire to create an everything app is rooted in Asia, where such apps have flourished for more than a decade. In Japan, people use Line, the country’s dominant messaging platform, to store vaccination cards and shop for clothes. In South Korea, people turn to KakaoTalk, which started as a messaging service, to send money and request taxi rides.
None have been as successful as Tencent’s WeChat, a messaging, social media and payments app used by more than 1 billion people, mostly in China. WeChat dominates the mobile internet and is a one-stop shop to read news, talk with friends, order pizza or pay the landlord.
Many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have long considered WeChat the gold standard for mobile apps.
“If you go to China, you see how much easier everything is, and you say, ‘I wish I had that for myself,’” said Ted Livingston, the founder of the messaging platform Kik, which is backed by Tencent. “WeChat is effectively the operating system of daily life in China.”
In 2013, Snap’s Spiegel also referred to Tencent as a model when it came to making money. In an interview last year with Axios, he spoke glowingly of Tencent’s continued success with WeChat and said Snap was also building a “Snapchat super app.” Tencent has invested in Snap, most recently in 2017.
In 2019, following Uber’s initial public offering, Khosrowshahi echoed the super app mantra. He said he saw his ride-hailing app as the “Amazon of transportation” and wanted it to be the “operating system for your everyday life in a city.”
That same year, Zuckerberg stated similar ambitions for WhatsApp. Zuckerberg has since added payment and commerce features to Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, although none have become an everything app.
That may come down to different regulatory and cultural environments, Messina said. U.S. tech giants have come under heightened antitrust scrutiny from regulators around the world, but Chinese tech companies that have Beijing’s blessing have flourished, even amid a crackdown on tech power.
In November, Musk was asked at a companywide meeting at Twitter about his everything app idea, two people who attended the event said. An employee noted that there were fundamental differences between Twitter and Tencent, the people said.
Musk responded that the questioner didn’t know what he was talking about, before asking for the next question, the two attendees said.
Musk has not held back on his predictions for X. “If done right,” he said in a recent podcast interview, X could become “half of the global financial system.”
Linda Yaccarino, Twitter’s CEO, has also appeared enthusiastic about X.
“X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities," she tweeted on Sunday. “Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.”

U.S. Economy Grows As Recession Again Fails to Materialize: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The reading on gross domestic product was bolstered by consumer spending, showing that recession forecasts early in the year were premature, at least.
The economic recovery gained momentum in the spring as buoyant consumer spending and resurgent business investment helped, once again, to keep a recession at bay.
Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That was up from a 2 percent growth rate in the first three months of the year and far stronger than forecasters expected a few months ago.
Consumers led the way, as they have throughout the recovery from the severe but short-lived pandemic recession in 2020. Spending rose at a 1.6 percent rate, slower than in the first quarter but still solid. Much of that growth came from spending on services, as consumers shelled out for vacation travel, restaurant meals and Taylor Swift tickets.
Consumers didn't carry all the weight, however. Business investment rebounded in the second quarter after slumping in the first three months of the year, and increased spending by state and local governments contributed to growth.
"If you're looking for a working definition of 'resilient,' look no further than the American economy," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. "This is absolutely rock-solid."
The persistent strength of the economy has surprised economists, many of whom thought that high inflation -- and the Federal Reserve's efforts to stamp it out through aggressive interest-rate increases -- would lead to a recession, or at least a clear slowdown in the first half of the year. For a while, it looked as if they were going to be right: Tech companies were laying off tens of thousands of workers, the housing market was in a deep slump and a series of bank failures set up fears of a financial crisis.
Instead, layoffs were mostly contained to a handful of industries, the banking crisis did not spread and even the housing market has begun to stabilize. The job market stayed strong, giving Americans money to spend: Personal income, after taxes and adjusted for inflation, rose at a 2.5 percent rate in the second quarter.
"The things we were all freaked out about earlier this year all went away," said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America.
Inflation has also slowed significantly. Consumer prices rose at a 2.6 percent rate in the second quarter, down from 4.1 percent in the first quarter and from more than 7 percent in the first half of last year. That has eased pressure on the Fed to keep raising rates, leading some forecasters to question whether a recession is such a sure thing after all. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Wednesday that the central bank's staff economists no longer expected a recession to begin this year.
White House officials pointed to the report as evidence that President Biden's economic policies, including investments in infrastructure and green energy, were paying off. In a blog post on Thursday, the president's Council of Economic Advisers noted that investment in manufacturing facilities had contributed more than a third of a percentage point to overall G.D.P. growth, the most in more than four decades.
Mr. Biden, in a statement, said the data was evidence of "Bidenomics in action."
Weiler, a manufacturer of paving and forestry equipment, recently opened a 120,000-square-foot building at its Knoxville, Iowa, headquarters. The company will use only about a quarter of the space right away, said Patrick Weiler, its president and chief executive. But he is betting on continued growth.
"We just think we've got a pretty good future, and it seemed like a logical investment," he said.
Demand has been strong coming out of the pandemic, Mr. Weiler said. Now that supply-chain disruptions are being resolved -- for a while, the company had trouble getting the engines that power its equipment -- he can meet that demand. Federal infrastructure spending, he added, should help keep sales strong even if private demand slows.
"There's very good end-user confidence because they see a lot of work coming," Mr. Weiler said.
Still, many economists say consumers are likely to pull back their spending in the second half of the year, putting a drag on the recovery. Savings built up earlier in the pandemic are dwindling. Credit card balances are rising. And although unemployment remains low, job growth and wage growth have slowed.
"All those tailwinds and buffers that were supporting consumption are not as strong anymore," said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. "It feels to me like this hard landing has been delayed rather than canceled."

Full text: 'Luxe, Calme, Volupté'
Through Aug. 11. Candice Madey, 1 Rivington Street, Manhattan; 917-415-8655, candicemadey.com
For many young artists in the cash-poor, art-rich East Village of the 1970s and very early 1980s, bathtub-in-kitchen tenement apartments were also studios. You get an immediate sense of forced spatial economy in "Luxe, Calme, Volupté," a salon-style group show of some 70 works from that time and place, each small enough to have been done on a kitchen table.
The show is a piquant tasting menu of a moment when realist art was suddenly in high flood after a long Minimalist/Conceptualist-induced drought. For a sense of new possibilities explored, or revisited, check out a 1981 Times Square cityscape by Jane Dickson, or Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt's 1986 altar boy valentine, or a sculpted pair of spike heels (real spikes!) by the great Greer Lankton, or a companionable 1988 trifecta in the form of Gail Thacker's photograph of Mark Morrisroe photographing Rafael Sánchez.
More than anything, this is a portrait show, of artists' lovers and friends, almost all artists themselves. Together they define a brief, bright community occupying a gentrifying bit of turf, and a dolorous passage in time: Several of the artists represented here would die of AIDS, with Richard Brintzenhofe, Luis Frangella, Peter Hujar, Nicolas Moufarrege and the experimental photographer Darrel Ellis among the early losses. (The Madey show has been organized by Antonio Sergio Bessa and Allen Frame, curators of the Darrel Ellis retrospective now at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.) Happily, illusions of "luxe, calme and volupté" were still possible when much of what's here was made. HOLLAND COTTER
'Reclamation'
Through Aug. 11. Sean Kelly Gallery, 475 10th Avenue, Manhattan; 212-239-1181, skny.com.
For the concluding exhibition of NXTHVN's graduating fellowship cohort, the artists in this program founded in 2019 by the painter Titus Kaphar and two partners in New Haven, Conn., have produced work that is visually arresting, materially inventive, and takes real risks.
In the group show, "Reclamation," Donald Guevara has fashioned collages of human limbs, animal appendages and bits of popular iconography mounted amid a rabble of multicolored shards titled "Glitches" (2023). His installation, which reads as a stop-motion blur of activity, brings to mind Sylvia Plath's line from "Elm": "a wind of such violence will tolerate no bystanding." Another highlight is Anindita Dutta's assemblages that combine black boots and shoes in which the heels are replaced by cruelly curved horns paired with sumptuous leather, cloth and feather textiles. Her series "Sex, Sexuality, and Society" (2023) finds that sweet seam between the phallic and the feminine, making it obvious that clothing really is talismanic conjuring in disguise.
Edgar Serrano's paintings flirt with horror, but with a light, comical touch. The red-eyed ghoul shrieking underneath a Stahlhelm military helmet in "Doctor Hardcore" (2023) seems both silly and disturbing. Lastly, in the downstairs gallery, Ashanté Kindle's circular paintings of hairstyling strips and acrylic on wood panel expound on her fascination with Black people's hair. Her previous work was mostly obsidian, but now has added variegated pigmentation and objects such as hair bows and beads that give the paintings more visual voltage. The entire exhibition is like this work: sensuality embedded in intellectual curiosity. SEPH RODNEY
Rachel Rossin
Through Aug. 11. Magenta Plains, 149 Canal Street, Manhattan; 917-388-2464, magentaplains.com.
The ground floor gallery at Magenta Plains is configured as a chapel -- but of what faith? The New York artist Rachel Rossin is as much a programmer as a painter, and her exhibition embroiders the boundaries around "the human" with knowing reverence. On a round LED screen mounted to the ceiling, the video "The Maw Of" pans and zooms through 3-D renderings of disembodied nerves and skeletons, glowing networks, and the orange and blue blobs of bodies viewed in infrared. It's a celestial tondo of the posthuman, a portal to the angels or their digital avatars. It turns the room red.
On the curved back wall hang five portraits of "mechs" -- robotic suits of anime armor. Their purplish, blurred silhouettes seem printed on top of the ridges of milky paint depicting pale, layered figures and puddling abstractions. In "Just like Velveteen Rabbit, Mech Standing," the largest and center panel, the mech's beatific pose echoes an obscure, winged shape sketched into the pulsing lavender shadows in butter yellow and grass. Several, such as "SCRY. 1 Corinthians 13:12.," a picture in minty pastels where the mech's pilot's face punches through the haze, incorporate line drawings of dragons labeled Bad or Good in a naïve hand; others feature angels. The apostle Paul had heaven in mind when he wrote, in 1 Corinthians, that "now we see as through a glass darkly"; Rossin's cyborg icons hold out that true vision might require a higher power, a congestion of human and machine.

Full text: The digital revolution promised amazing new opportunities -- and it delivered. Digital platforms promoted social interaction, democratized information and gave us hundreds of new ways to have fun.
But digital innovation has had a dark side. Giant digital platforms have provided new avenues of proliferation for the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, human trafficking, drug trafficking and bullying and have promoted eating disorders, addictive behaviors and teen suicide. Parents like Kristin Bride, whose teenage son killed himself after being mercilessly cyberbullied, have shared heartbreaking stories with Congress and the public about the potentially deadly consequences.
Nobody elected Big Tech executives to govern anything, let alone the entire digital world. If democracy means anything, it means that leaders on both sides of the aisle must take responsibility for protecting the freedom of the American people from the ever-changing whims of these powerful companies and their unaccountable C.E.O.s. Today we're stepping up to that challenge with a bipartisan bill to treat Big Tech the way we treat other industries.
A few Big Tech companies generate a majority of the world's internet traffic and essentially control nearly every aspect of Americans' digital lives. Platforms are protected from legal liability in many of their decisions, so they operate without accountability. Big Tech companies have far too much unrestrained power over our economy, our society and our democracy. These massive businesses post eye-popping profits while they suppress competition. Google uses its search engine to give preference to its own products, like Google Hotels and Google Flights, giving it an unfair leg up on competitors. Amazon sucks up information from small businesses that offer products for sale on its platform, then uses that information to run its own competing businesses. Apple forces entrepreneurs (and thereby consumers) to pay crushing commissions to use its App Store. A few Big Tech companies stifle all competition before it poses any serious threat.
Big Tech companies also prey on ordinary users. They vacuum up our personal data, often with little care for whether their practices are responsible or even legal. Some Big Tech platforms mislead us when we try to limit the data we share, and they regularly fall prey to massive data leaks that leave us vulnerable to criminal activity, foreign interference and disinformation. Adversaries in China and other countries often store or process our data. And if we want to know how our data is being used or why our posts are being taken down, good luck getting an answer. We're usually in the dark about where our data goes or how it is used.
Enough is enough. It's time to rein in Big Tech. And we can't do it with a law that only nibbles around the edges of the problem. Piecemeal efforts to stop abusive and dangerous practices have failed. Congress is too slow, it lacks the tech expertise, and the army of Big Tech lobbyists can pick off individual efforts easier than shooting fish in a barrel. Meaningful change -- the change worth engaging every member of Congress to fight for -- is structural.
For more than a century, Congress has established regulatory agencies to preserve innovation while minimizing harm presented by emerging industries. In 1887 the Interstate Commerce Commission took on railroads. In 1914 the Federal Trade Commission took on unfair methods of competition and later unfair and deceptive acts and practices. In 1934 the Federal Communications Commission took on radio (and then television). In 1975 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took on nuclear power, and in 1977 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took on electric generation and transmission. We need a nimble, adaptable, new agency with expertise, resources and authority to do the same for Big Tech.
Our Digital Consumer Protection Commission Act would create an independent, bipartisan regulator charged with licensing and policing the nation's biggest tech companies -- like Meta, Google and Amazon -- to prevent online harm, promote free speech and competition, guard Americans' privacy and protect national security. The new watchdog would focus on the unique threats posed by tech giants while strengthening the tools available to the federal agencies and state attorneys general who have authority to regulate Big Tech.
Our legislation would guarantee common-sense safeguards for everyone who uses tech platforms. Families would have the right to protect their children from sexual exploitation, cyberbullying and deadly drugs. Certain digital platforms have promoted the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, suicidal ideation and eating disorders or done precious little to combat these evils; our bill would require Big Tech to mitigate such harms and allow families to seek redress if they do not.
Americans deserve to know how their data is collected and used and to control who can see it. They deserve the freedom to opt out of targeted advertising. And they deserve the right to go online without, say, some A.I. tool's algorithm denying them a loan based on their race or politics. If our legislation is enacted, platforms would face consequences for suppressing speech in violation of their own terms of service. The commission would have the flexibility and agility to develop more expertise and respond to new risks, like those posed by generative A.I.
Our bill would set clear rules for tech companies and impose real consequences for companies that break the law. For the giant companies, anticompetitive practices -- like exploiting market dominance, tying the sale of one product to another, charging customers different prices for the same product and preventing employees from working for competitors -- would be prohibited. The bill would set a high bar for mergers and acquisitions by dominant Big Tech platforms and make it possible to block and reverse harmful deals.
Reining in tech giants will be hard, but it's a fight worth fighting. If we win, Americans finally will have the tools they need to combat many online evils harming their children and ruining lives. And small businesses will have a fighting chance to innovate and compete in a world dominated by tech monopolies.
No company, no industry and no C.E.O. should be above the law. These reforms will ensure that the next generation of great American tech companies will operate responsibly while remaining on the cutting edge of innovation.
It's time for Congress to act.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the eight-minute mark of the final of the CAN 18 soccer tournament, the players on the Mauritania team score three times in rapid succession.
The balls hitting the goalkeeper's small net sound like the blasts of a cannon. Boom. Boom. Boom. The last two happen so quickly that many in the crowd miss them.
"Did they score?" the Ivory Coast fan squished next to me asks, looking stunned. "Yes, twice," a Mauritanian fan on my other side responds gleefully.
It doesn't take long to understand that the annual soccer tournament of Paris's 18th arrondissement is different: The stadium is a small, caged turf court in the middle of the Goutte d'Or -- the dense, working-class landing spot for each new wave of immigrants to the city, a place where African wax stores and tailors for boubous compete with boulangeries and bistros among the crowded streets.
The tournament was one of many around Paris inspired by the 2019 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, or Coupe d'Afrique des nations in French, the continental competition typically held every two years. The events have become so popular that the finals of one in Créteil, a southeastern suburb of Paris, were broadcast on Amazon Prime last summer.
In the Goutte d'Or, Mamoudou Camara's principal aim wasn't to shine a positive light on immigration and community spirit in his neighborhood, which is tucked behind the Gare du Nord -- Europe's busiest train station -- and is among the city's most impoverished, gritty and diverse areas. He was just thinking a tournament might help his friends survive the hot nights during Ramadan. He raised the idea on Snapchat, and by the end of that evening in summer 2019, six teams had registered. A day later, there were six more.
Instead of holding the event in a far-off stadium, Camara and his friends decided to host it in their childhood nest, the mini court in the center of the urban park where they spent their summer nights and weekends, battling over a ball and rounds of Coca-Cola or Fanta. (The loser paid.)
It offers a very different atmosphere than the marble statues and the manicured flower beds of the Tuileries and Luxembourg gardens. On game nights, the park, Square Léon, is buzzing with older men crowded around checker tables, little kids clambering up playground equipment and older women in West African dresses selling bags of homemade doughnuts and slushy ginger drinks that both tickle and soothe the throat.
Just before the final match starts, a tambour player beats out rhythms.
"In our neighborhood, we have all nationalities," said Camara, 26. "We are proud to say we are multicultural."
Around 30 percent of the 21,000 residents in this neighborhood were immigrants or foreigners in 2019, according to France's national statistics institute.
Sixteen teams registered this year, the event's fourth edition, to play 31 games over three weeks. On this June night, we are down to the finals. The Ivory Coast, a veteran team that won the inaugural tournament in 2019, is back in its orange and green jerseys, trying to reclaim the title. Challenging them is Mauritania -- a team packed with young players, many of them semiprofessionals, wearing yellow and brown. The jerseys were created by a celebrated local designer who collaborates with Nike, and who has been invited to the presidential palace.
It is just one sign of how the tournament has matured. This year, the neighborhood city hall provides a small grandstand on one side of the court. Everywhere else, spectators stand, claiming their spots a good hour before the game begins.
By the time the referee blows his whistle, we are standing eight rows thick.
The court measures just 25 meters by 16.5 meters -- about 82 feet by 54 feet -- roughly one-seventeenth of FIFA's recommended field size. It is framed by a low concrete wall, topped by a tall chain link fence.
The confined area makes for an intense game of precision, tight tricks, bursts of speed and a blasting ball that echoes against the walls and crashes into the fence every few minutes.
This is soccer by inches, with a team losing and gaining the ball within seconds.
Camara and other organizers devised the rules: five players per team on the court; no offside; corner kicks are thrown in; any foul after the fifth within a half results in a penalty kick; and games last 30 minutes to an hour, depending on their importance.
Two people livestream matches, and another camera is rolling for the referee to review plays.
The first year, all players had to be locals, but the rules have since loosened, allowing players from elsewhere to participate. But those who grew up competing on the court quickly reveal themselves by using the side walls to their advantage, bouncing passes around defenders to their teammates and back to themselves.
Martin Riedler, who three years ago formed the tournament's French team, compared it to a boxing ring.
"You have to be on your toes the whole time, which makes the experience so intense," said Riedler, who attended Santa Clara University in California on a soccer scholarship. He has packed his team with elite players who can hit the cross bar from the halfway line of a full field, but who also find the arena overwhelming. "You know you won't sleep at night after a game."
Players slam each other to the turf, then pick one another up. They continually battle against the wall, so close that a spectator might graze them through the fence. They offer up-close renditions of spectacular maneuvers, flicking the ball over their opponents' heads and spinning it around their feet. That is one of the beauties of a small court, the referee Bengaly Souré tells me. It's a compression chamber of technical plays.
"There's no space, but they create space," he said.
When a player jumps and kicks the ball into the net midair, Souré turns to the fence and expresses his admiration.
The crowd is part of the fun. Spectators shout their observations over the sounds of African beats, booming from loudspeakers. It is agreed that the player wearing No. 7 for Mauritania -- who plays for a team in Italy -- is a dangerous force. And though the Ivory Coast falls increasingly behind, the game could turn at any moment.
"I've seen a team that's losing 4-1 make a comeback," said Makenzy Kapaya, a 37-year-old artist who grew up in the Goutte d'Or but later relocated to a less cramped apartment elsewhere. Like many in the crowd, he has returned to watch the games and to reunite with childhood friends.
"If you have problems, people will help you here, no matter what your origins," Kapaya said.
The Goutte d'Or, a dense, working-class area, often makes news for unflattering reasons -- drugs, prostitution, violence. The library closed for months three years ago because employees said they had been repeatedly threatened by dealers selling near its doors. Following the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Nahel Merzouk this summer and the subsequent protests across the country, the local police station was attacked.
Éric Lejoindre, the mayor of the 18th arrondissement, pointed out that local volunteers had been quietly helping with homework, cooking and housing for years. A group of therapists in the Goutte d'Or hold regular listening sessions, setting out chairs in an abandoned lot for passers-by to unload their burdens.
For all its problems, the neighborhood has huge heart, Lejoindre said.
"Locals know it, but sometimes we need it to emerge in a spectacular fashion," he said. "For me, CAN is one of those moments when the neighborhood can revel in being a bit exceptional."
After halftime, the Ivory Coast players rally, bringing the score to 9-7. But then Mauritania yanks the plug from their energy and dreams. As the sky dims into an inky night, and spectators hold up their phones as lanterns, Mauritania scores again. And again. And again. Boom, boom, boom. The players start to do little dances after each goal.
When Souré blows his whistle for full time, a crowd surges onto the tiny court to embrace the young Mauritanian team in a squealing cyclone of joy.
Camara, who will take a few weeks off before beginning preparations for next year's event, said he was continually surprised by how much joy the little tournament had brought to the neighborhood. At a time when anti-immigration sentiments are growing and identity politics are flaring in France, he said he considered it a unifying event. "We thought we were just starting something for fun," he said, "but we created something bigger."
Red and white fireworks burst above the little park in the heart of the Goutte d'Or. The celebration will continue for hours.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The animated sci-fi comedy, now on Hulu as a reboot of a reboot of a reboot, is the same show as ever. For fans, that will be enough.
"Information wants to be free" may be a dubious maxim, but it has a more obviously true corollary: Intellectual property wants to be exploited.
I.P. does not want to be free, however, which is why the animated sci-fi comedy "Futurama" returns on Monday, after a 10-year absence, on the subscription streaming service Hulu. (The first new episode makes reference to Fulu, the fourth most popular streamer in the year 3023.) The show had a meandering, glitchy history from 1999 to 2013: It premiered on Fox, was canceled, got rebooted as a collection of direct-to-DVD movies, was resurrected as a series on Comedy Central and then was canceled again. The current season is variously labeled the eighth or (by Hulu) the 11th.
Whatever number you give it, the new "Futurama" is very much the old "Futurama," almost aggressively so. The voice cast is intact, veteran producers return, and the first two episodes were written by Patric M. Verrone and Eric Horsted, two of the most frequent writers from the show's earlier days. It's an impressive testimony to loyalty. Also back, in a testimony to sunk cost, is one of the show's glories: its jazzy, stuttering, elaborately animated opening sequence.
More centrally, it is the same show in form and texture. The crew of the space-faring delivery service Planet Express, and its headquarters in 31st-century New New York, are unchanged. Shaggy, knockabout stories situated midway between space opera and workplace comedy are still the vehicle for a steady stream of topical humor, wordplay and jokes that range from subtle to shameless. (Personal favorite in the new season: "Impassable Burger." Think about it.)
It's the formula that Matt Groening, who created "Futurama" and developed it with David X. Cohen, had already perfected in "The Simpsons"; Philip J. Fry (Billy West), the dopey delivery-boy hero of "Futurama," is a younger and more guileless Homer Simpson. If "Futurama" were a person, you could imagine it saying "Doh" when it returns after 10 years and "The Simpsons," the show in whose shadow it has always resided, is still around.
"Futurama" ended sweetly in 2013, with Fry and his one-eyed alien inamorata, Leela (Katey Sagal), who had spent a lifetime together while the rest of the world was frozen in place -- the fallout from one of the harebrained schemes of Professor Farnsworth (also West) -- about to be zapped back in time to do it all again. The new season picks up in the next moment, with both fictional time and the actual show rebooted. The problematic robot Bender (John DiMaggio) hopefully proclaims, "The important thing is, whatever happened, it'll never, ever happen again."
Casual self-mockery is the theme of the opener, a commentary on binge-watching with digs at Hulu, "Black Mirror" and the checkered history of "Futurama." (Personal favorite fake television show title: "Better Call Cthulhu," or maybe "Alien vs. Predator vs. Bluey.") As the season goes on -- six episodes were made available -- it becomes increasingly clear that the show is going to have no qualms about mining its own past and iconography, returning to old plot lines and reviving a panoply of characters. (Personal favorite reappearance: the Méliès man in the moon.)
This insularity is a legitimate critical concern, though its effects will be specific. If you haven't watched the show before, you won't know what you're missing, but you probably will be aware that you're missing something and that this is a problem. If you're already a fan, you'll be perfectly happy. If enough fans are drawn to subscribe to Hulu, then party on.
A greater concern is that a little of the zip has gone out of the writing and the overall comic conceptualism. Episodes aimed at big, easy targets like Bitcoin and Amazon feel routine, no matter how many opportunities they provide for making connections to the show's past. And what seems like a significant increase in the screen time devoted to the characters' various family units gives the stories a dusting of sentimentality that wasn't there before.
A lot of things have happened in the world in the 10 years that "Futurama" was away; one is that adult animation for TV kept developing. "Rick and Morty" demonstrated how self-referential, jokey humor could be taken to a high pitch of intensity and inventiveness, and "Bojack Horseman" showed that animated funny-animal comedy could be unexpectedly complex and moving. As enjoyable as it may continue to be, "Futurama" sits in a time warp where those shows haven't happened yet.

Where Are the Latinos in Hollywood?: [Op-Ed]

Author: Dávila, Arlene

Publication info: Dávila, Arlene.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Corporate America's treatment of Latinx people as a homogeneous monolithic group, instead of the diverse demographic it is, has for decades perpetuated stereotypes of Latino authenticity. These stereotypes have disproportionately depicted Latinos on TV and in movies as Spanish speakers that hailed from Latin America and shared a particular Latin "look."
In Hollywood, this narrative has reinforced the notion that we are a niche market that is separate from the mainstream, which could be served through the importation of programming that is cheaper to produce in Latin America over programming that is produced in the United States.
That's why it was exciting to see Jenna Ortega and Pedro Pascal make Emmy history this month. For the first time two Latino actors were nominated in the lead acting category in the same year, for the hit shows "Wednesday" and "The Last of Us."
Though Latinx people make up 19 percent of the U.S. population, they account for less than 5 percent of actors cast in speaking roles in the nation's top-grossing films. Additionally, representation in the media industry as a whole stands at a mere 12 percent, with the majority of positions being service oriented, like cleaning services and security. These numbers have remained stagnant for decades, which is outrageous when you consider that they make up nearly half the population of Los Angeles County.
Why has the media industry been so unwilling to acknowledge and address this growing demographic of potential viewers and consumers?
Latinx creatives have told me that many executives in Hollywood don't understand why they are outraged by how few Latinx people appear in films and television shows. After all, there is already a variety of streaming offerings from Latin America and Spain. But there is a profound difference between these markets.
We wouldn't mistake the experience of Indigenous Mexicans living in Mexico for the experience of a fifth-generation Chicana. This is why many in the industry are identifying as Latinx -- a term that signals gender inclusivity and recognition of our racial and ethnic diversity -- to call attention to a pattern of exclusion of Latinx writers and creators that are representing the U.S. experience.
The globalization of Spanish language media has only widened the existing gaps between the robust development of movies and shows produced in Latin America and the limited opportunities for Latinx writers, directors and showrunners in the United States. In recent decades, Latin American media companies have benefited from investments from American streaming conglomerates like Netflix, the lower costs of producing and importing programming in Latin America and investments by governments in the region that support their film industries.
While streaming platforms offer a wealth of series and films from Spain and Latin America, there is a lack of representation of stories written by Latinx people that reflect their experiences. While actors and writers from Latin America have had the opportunity to expand their résumés with credits from global serials produced by platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Max, Latinx actors and audiences have fewer roles to choose from. The leads cast in series like "Wednesday" and the "Last of Us" are rare exceptions.
Research shows that in the United States, Latinx actors are often cast in the roles of lower-class characters, criminals or immigrants. The gap is wider still for Afro-Latinos. In shows produced in Latin America, the majority of actors cast as leads and heroines are blond and white, while darker-skinned actors are often relegated to secondary roles, housekeepers or criminals, if they are represented at all. Additionally, Latinx writers face extra barriers when entering a shrinking industry, as highlighted by the writers' strike.
The few productions that have been written or created by Latinx people and have represented our communities in real and personal ways have been canceled after a few seasons. When shows like "Gentefied," "Vida" and the "Gordita Chronicles" were shut down despite positive reviews, writers and fans alike were left wondering why. In the age of streaming, algorithm-driven decisions make it difficult to determine what counts as success with transparency, especially when algorithms are biased against new content.
Latinx audiences remain avid consumers of films, TV and other media, even if they don't see themselves reflected. Some may question why media conglomerates should change and invest in original content and programming or cast Latinx actors and writers when the cheaper importation-based model is so profitable and seemingly successful. Yet they should evolve because those formulas have historically left Latinx audiences mostly untapped. There are generations of talented scriptwriters, producers and filmmakers who have been underutilized and countless rich stories and ideas that have yet to be told. Film and TV that represent the experience of Latinx communities in the United States enrich the media ecosystem by offering a more accurate representation of American demographics.
Additionally, we must address the negative impacts of the media's import-heavy formula for Latinx audiences, which limits opportunities and perpetuates the perception of Latinx people as foreigners rather than fellow Americans deserving equal visibility on television and movie screens.
It's worth noting that Latinx people are not the only group excluded by the globalization of streaming. That Ms. Ortega and Mr. Pascal received recognition raises the question of whether we have reached a crucial turning point. It's worth considering how we can leverage the current SAG-AFTRA and W.G.A. strikes to also address issues of representation and investment in productions that will provide working opportunities for Latinx actors, writers and showrunners alongside matters of pay equity for media workers.
Finally, it is time to consider the global appeal of entertainment featuring Latinx actors. I want to see more roles for actors like Ariana DeBose, the first Afro-Latina to win an Oscar, for a supporting role in "West Side Story," and productions by filmmakers and MacArthur "genius grant" awardees Alex Rivera and Cristina Ibarra, among many other outstanding Latinx creatives.
I often wonder what it would look like if Hollywood dared to recognize that Latinx talent is not an exception.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The directors of "Earth Mama" and "A Thousand and One" compare notes on complex portraits of Black motherhood that reject '90s stereotypes.
"Earth Mama" opens with a fake-out: a young Black woman named Gia (Tia Nomore) happily tickling a cooing newborn. But as the camera pulls away, a more ambivalent reality is exposed. The baby belongs to an older couple visiting the mall portrait studio to take their family photo, while Gia, very much pregnant, wistfully gazes after them.
Appearing early in Savanah Leaf's new big-screen drama, "Earth Mama," Gia's longing and loneliness result from her struggle to regain custody of her two older kids, now in foster care, and to prevent her next child from suffering their fate. Leaf poignantly explores the impediments facing such mothers -- limited and highly supervised visits with their children, low-paying jobs, bigoted social workers and all-consuming parenting classes -- and their determination to reunite with their children.
The result is a complex portrait of Black motherhood and an unflinching condemnation of child protective services because of its disproportionate punitive impact on Black families. It's a system that scholar Dorothy Roberts describes as "family policing." According to a recent study, 53 percent of all Black youngsters will experience a child-welfare investigation before they reach 18, almost twice that of their white counterparts.
In New York City, these racial disparities are even worse. A racial equity audit conducted in 2020 by the Administration for Children's Services found that Black families are seven times as likely as white families to be accused of child maltreatment and 13 times as likely to have their children removed.
The filmmaker A.V. Rockwell does not cite these staggering statistics in her "A Thousand and One" (now available on Amazon Prime). Instead, she reveals, in breathtaking fashion, the devastating impact that the New York child welfare system had on Inez (Teyana Taylor) and her partner, Lucky (Will Catlett), through their desperate act to interrupt this cycle for their son, Terry.
While both films premiered at Sundance this year, with "A Thousand and One" winning its Grand Jury Prize, they have two more things in common: they empathize with Black mothers separated from their children without overly romanticizing their own protagonists. And unlike the much older and similarly themed "Losing Isaiah," (1995) starring Halle Berry, they do so without pathologizing their choices, bad or good, and by arguing that the most viable safety nets for Black children are the communities from which they come.
In a video interview with Leaf, a former Olympic volleyball player born in London and raised in the Bay Area, and Rockwell, who first gained attention for directing Alicia Keys's musical short "The Gospel" and grew up in Queens, the two young Black women filmmakers shared their mutual appreciation for each other's work, discussed how they rejected older movie stereotypes about Black mothers without overcorrecting, and explained why in their feature debuts they felt that first-time actors were the perfect leads for their imperfect characters. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Do you know each other?
A.V. ROCKWELL We have these parallel paths. Savanah was at the "A Thousand and One" premiere at Sundance, which was exciting. I didn't have the privilege to see her film there, but I've seen it since, and it's quite stunning, my lady.
SAVANAH LEAF Thank you, thank you. I've also seen A.V.'s work since we've both been doing music videos and commercials for years. I didn't know her through the whole journey of this film, but I did see the big buildup to this moment and its progression over the years throughout all of her work. I'm proud of and excited for A.V.
The settings seem like love letters to the different places you grew up, New York City and Northern California.
ROCKWELL Before I knew what the story would be, I knew I wanted to do my farewell-to-New York story, something that acknowledged what it meant to come of age in New York as a young woman. Inez is not young young, but being a young mother forces you to grow up. And then it is also about New York as a rough and tough city similar to Inez's roughness and toughness, coming of age as a more palatable and accessible city. So I was working through the heartbreak of seeing how gentrification was changing areas like Harlem that were predominantly Black. New York is the villain in many ways.
LEAF This film is very nostalgic for me. I recall what it was like to be in the Bay Area in the mid-2000s, and there was a real sense of community then. Gia works at Photo Magic, which was based on a real portrait studio where everybody went to take these happy family photos in front of escapist backdrops. It was always so beautiful but also so painful because everyone was showing their version of a happy family.
The Bay is also surrounded by the Redwood forest. It's a place that people in the Bay, including Gia, go to as an escape. I thought a lot about those trees and how strong they are, and how they communicate with one another beneath the ground. Those roots represent her inner life, her connection to a lineage of Black women, and the trauma she inherited and, at times, wants to break away from. I find beauty, power and strength in that lineage.
Let's talk about Inez and Gia. How did you craft these flawed yet layered characters?
ROCKWELL The lack of perfection was important to me. I think a lot of times, because we've been represented so stereotypically in film and TV, we can overcorrect. This movie starts in the early '90s, and when I think of so many Black classics that came out at that time that also represented the urban experience, you just really didn't get the full breadth of who we were as women, or often the complicated sides of us were given no context. So I wanted to give back to the women of that time. Inez is a character that desperately wants to be loved. I don't think Black women need to be perfect, to be educated, come from the best background, to be loved. You're deserving of love anyway.
LEAF I've seen many Black women portrayed in films that I don't resonate with, especially with how they deal with pain and persist. So, through Gia and how she is resilient and handles all the stresses of her life, I wanted to create a film that resonated with me. I understand there's a whole history of Black mothers in cinema, but I don't think I was trying to counter that directly. I just wanted to make something as truthful and honest, to me, as possible.
ROCKWELL I think honesty is a great and important word.
Let's talk about those powerful performances. The rapper Tia Nomore and singer Teyana Taylor are also making their film debuts. How did you know they would be your Gia and Inez, respectively?
LEAF At first, I was thinking about a person that would have to be in every scene, so I was looking for an experienced actor who was perfectly Bay Area and a recent mom to play Gia. But, when we met Tia, she had had a baby a year prior, was still breastfeeding, and knew the physicality of going into labor. So although she had never acted before, she was a performer, and because she was born and raised in Oakland, she knew a lot of the people in the film, which was wild. There was already a sense of community before we even started filming.
ROCKWELL Teyana authentically represented the New York City woman I was looking for. I wrote this character in a very nuanced way, and even from her first reading, I thought she could pick up on the character's psychology. And because she has a performance background, I saw her bringing her creativity to how she interpreted it. Teyana has her own story to tell, so she could pour into this character in the right way and have compassion for her because, like me, she knew who this woman was in the real world and didn't look down on her.
Why did you decide to confront the foster care system?
LEAF When researching the foster-care system, you realize how broken it is on every level. How are mothers supposed to attend all the required classes, have a job, sometimes pay the foster family to take care of their children, and make their visitation hours? What does that make children feel like? What does it make parents feel like? And is that good for anybody? I wanted to depict this cycle, which is almost impossible to escape. I'm talking about children in the foster-care system who grow up and have their own children.
ROCKWELL A big part of Inez's journey is about what it means to be a woman in this community, let alone one that has gone through foster care. She's there protecting Terry from the same experience she had, but who's there protecting her? I think what drew me to the foster-care system was seeing how people who spent their childhoods in foster care were impacted as adults when the system failed them. So much of this film is about the meaning of home and the power of family. All those things are what people in foster care want more than anything. And so, this is a story about our community and displacement and the desperate longing for a sense of home.
Your characters respond to that threat of people by making controversial choices. Without giving too much away, how do you want the audience to react to their difficult decisions?
LEAF The woman that opens my film directly speaks to that when she says, "You can't walk in my shoes, but you can walk beside me." What interested me was getting the audience to a point where they feel for this Black mother who does something very real and relatable but is also difficult to watch. It is something people are very quick to judge if they just see it straight off the bat. So, bringing the audience on this journey and allowing them to walk beside her was really important. And hopefully, when that turning point happens, they still see her working hard to be the best mother she can be.
ROCKWELL It's very difficult not to talk about the end, but Inez's decision when she embarks on this journey with Terry is the ultimate act of love. She's trying to give the same love to this child that she wishes somebody gave her when she was his age. If people can understand that, they can understand the heart of what we were trying to get to in the first place, which is this conversation around foster care and the way it can leave people truly broken. In a way, I think it's beautiful that Inez is desperately trying to break a cycle. She knows the power of love as an action. It is not just a feeling or hope for another human being, but really taking matters into your own hands when you need to give somebody the life you wish you had.

Scoping Out People Is Part of His Plan: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Marc Rebillet, who became known during pandemic lockdowns for livestreaming improvised songs featuring electronic loops, takes his grooves to the streets.
In the spring of 2020, Marc Rebillet's improvised, solo funk shows, livestreamed on YouTube and Facebook from his apartment, became a lockdown sensation. Wearing a bathrobe and boxers, Mr. Rebillet posted a phone number and asked callers to suggest a word or theme that he'd use to write anthemic songs on the fly, belting them out in a power baritone. The tunes were danceable, subversive and hilariously raunchy.
Mr. Rebillet, 34, whose nickname, "Loop Daddy," refers to the electronic live-looping technique he uses in his compositions, now has more than 2 million subscribers on YouTube and has parlayed his online popularity into a more established career. He embarked on a sold-out national tour, hosts a show on Amazon Music's Twitch channel (Jack Black was a recent guest) and is the subject of a new documentary.
Since April, he's been performing pop-up concerts on city sidewalks for "We Outside," his newest livestream series. Mr. Rebillet welcomes the bits of chaos that passers-by bring. He has sampled a youth marching band and the howl of a dog named Cheeto. He was recently delighted when a man rolled into the crowd in a wheelchair, then leaped up to dance.
Mr. Rebillet is now planning a thoroughly un-chaotic studio album, one "that's layered and well thought-out, produced, composed, intentionally done," he said. He lives alone in Manhattan's Seaport neighborhood.
BODY WEIGHT These days, I'll get up probably around 6 or 7 a.m. I will usually do a workout in my apartment. I do this body-weight exercise program that I've been doing for like 10 years. It's called "You Are Your Own Gym." It's based originally on a book written by this guy Mark Lauren. He turned it into an app ages ago that I must have found while I was living in Paris. I was very scrawny at the time. Over the course of a few years, this program has become a very regular, every-other-day part of my life.
UNICYCLE MAN I'll get on my electric unicycle. (It's a pretty dorky name -- I tend to just call it a "wheel" because it's not nearly as silly.) I've got a few of them. You put the pedals down and you stand on it facing forward. They go like 45 miles an hour. It's like a little car. I go and get my little fruit bowl. There's a place up near Fulton Street called Healthy Green Juice Bar, and they will fix me a bowl of fresh fruit with a scoop of peanut butter. It's a perfect little breakfast: a little bit of protein, a bunch of fruit.
PEOPLE-WATCHING I might go to City Hall Park and eat my little fruit bowl, watch people start to move around and get the day started. And then I'll come back and start making preparations to get my car to my apartment and load it up with all of my equipment so that I can drive to some random place in the city, unpack it all, set up and play a show for strangers for a couple of hours.
POWER BUSKING What I usually try and do is find a location, like a street corner or a triangle or some plaza, the day before or a couple of days before. And this past Saturday, I really had nothing. And so I just decided to get in my car a little earlier than I normally would and drive and just land on the first place that my instinct led me and where a parking space became available -- that's kind of an important factor -- and then just do it there.
So, amazingly, I was driving around Union Square, and someone pulled out right as I was coming up behind them. I parked and got set up. And it was a really, really awesome show. A marching band showed up. It was the Brooklyn United, they're an all-Black marching band, kids who are basically raising money for the organization.
We were just playing the show, and it was pretty crowded at that point. And we hear in the distance, "ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta." Some people in the back clued me in that it was a marching band. I was like, "Get over here!" And people made way and they came right in. You can see it online. They came right on in and just killed it. I sampled them and made a beat with the drum sounds. That's the kind of stuff you just can't plan. I mean, I guess I could have planned it, but it wouldn't have been nearly as fun if I had.
AFTER PARTY About 5 p.m., I'll go and get a drink with my friends who hang around and help me pack my stuff back into my car. We'll go get a drink in the area, smoke a joint, sort of just bask in the afterglow and talk about fun moments and chew the fat. Then after that, I just can't go on anymore, so I get in my car and leave.
HOME/ANTI-PERSON At that point I'm just done, and I really just disappear. I stop answering texts and everything and I basically just sit around and watch YouTube. It's sad. It's like I become this anti-person that just sits. And I want an absence of stimuli -- nothing, just nothing. I'm not even looking at what I'm watching, really, I'm just existing. Of course, I'll call my mom. I always call my mom after the show. And she really wants to know how it went.
VAPE AND ICE CREAM Generally, I'll order something really, really greasy. I tend to have this feeling after these shows that, "OK, I've worked really hard and now I can do things that are not good for me." So, I'll usually get a bunch of ice cream and then I'll also get a nicotine vape. I'll just suck it down until basically I'm like a Roman emperor. I'm like: My belly's full, I've got grapes, I'm passed out on the couch just "uhhhhh." And then, I wake up in the morning and do my little workout like nothing ever happened.
NEAT FREAK Probably midnight, 1 a.m., I draw the blinds, I'll brush my teeth, put my stuff away, because I like to wake up in the morning to a clean kitchen. Everything put away, everything nice, in its place, so I can go to sleep like a little angel and not have to worry about anything the next morning. And also to not look upon the horrifying condition, the state of me the night before, you know.

Quiet Day Still Leads to Winning Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed out another winning week with a quiet Friday, as stocks found some stability after sliding the day before.
The S&P 500 edged up by 1.47, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,536.34 to cap its eighth winning week in the last 10. The Dow Jones industrial average added 2.51 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 35,227.69, its 10th gain in a row. The Nasdaq composite slipped 30.50, or 0.2 percent, to 14,032.81 a day after tumbling to its worst loss in more than four months.
Roper Technologies rallied 3.7 percent for one of the larger gains in the S&P 500 after it reported better profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. The company, which looks to dominate niche tech markets, also raised its financial forecasts for the full year.
The earnings reporting season is gaining momentum, and a majority of companies are reporting better results than expected. They're doing so by a bit less than usual, though, according to FactSet.
On the losing side of Wall Street was American Express, which fell 3.9 percent. It reported stronger profit for the spring than expected, but its revenue fell short of forecasts.
Comerica swung from an initial gain to a loss of 4.1 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. The regional bank also reported a decline in average customer deposits, though it said the levels stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Deposits have been under heavy scrutiny since several banks failed in March after customers suddenly yanked out their cash.
The stock market has generally been on a tear this year as the economy has defied predictions for a recession. It's so far powered through much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation, and the hope is that it may outlast the Federal Reserve's rate-hike campaign.
The Fed is widely expected to raise its federal funds rate on Wednesday to its highest level since 2001. But the hope is that will be the final increase of the cycle because inflation has been cooling since last summer. The federal funds rate started last year at virtually zero.
To be sure, the 18.1 percent jump for the S&P 500 this year also has critics saying the rally has come too far, too fast. The risk of recession remains because inflation and interest rates remain high.
When Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, speaks on Wednesday after the central bank's decision on rates, economists at Deutsche Bank say he "is likely to emphasize that further evidence is needed to have confidence inflation will be tamed."
Besides the Fed meeting, next week will also feature earnings reports from three of the "Magnificent Seven" companies behind the majority of the S&P 500's gains this year. Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft will report their earnings, and expectations are high after they all soared more than 35 percent so far this year.
Another one of the seven, Tesla, slumped sharply on Thursday despite reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected on fears about upcoming growth. It helped drag the S&P 500 to a loss and the Nasdaq composite to a drop of 2.1 percent.
The top stocks have become so big and their movements have become so influential over the market that Nasdaq is rebalancing its Nasdaq 100 index before trading begins Monday.
The seven stocks, which also include Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, are collectively trading with stock prices that are 44 times higher than their earnings per share over the last 12 months, according to Savita Subramanian, equity strategist at Bank of America.
That's an expensive level compared with history, but the other stocks in the S&P 500 are trading at a more reasonable-looking 17 times earnings. The stock market's gains have broadened out a bit, and Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research report that she expects that to continue.
In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.83 percent from 3.86 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.85 percent from 4.84 percent.
In markets abroad, stocks were mixed across Europe and Asia.
Taiwan's Taiex fell 0.8 percent after TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of computer chips, said it expects its sales to fall 10 percent this year as demand wanes. It also said it would not meet a 2024 target for starting production at a factory under construction in Arizona.

ESPN Is Said to Talk With Pro Sports Leagues About Taking Minority Stake in Network: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Disney-controlled channel is trying to find a way forward in the streaming age and has had discussions with the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and Major League Baseball.
ESPN has held talks with some of the most powerful leagues in professional sports, including the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, about taking a minority stake in its business.
The cable network, controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has had exploratory talks with the leagues as it tries to figure out its way forward in the streaming age, three people with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.
Disney declined to comment.
Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said in a CNBC interview last week that the company was "looking for strategic partners" that could help ESPN with either distribution or content. "But we want to stay in the sports business," said Mr. Iger, whose contract with Disney was recently extended through 2026.
Selling a stake in ESPN could give Disney a cash infusion as it faces pricey renewals with sports leagues including the N.B.A., which is sure to demand a premium for the rights to show its games in the coming years. Hearst, the owner of magazines like Cosmopolitan and information services like Fitch Group, owns a minority stake in ESPN.
ESPN -- long a profit center for Disney, which acquired the network in 1995 -- has come under pressure in recent years as viewers cut the cable cord in favor of streaming services. The cost of sports rights, meanwhile, has been driven up by newer entrants including Apple, Amazon and YouTube. Trying to outbid deep-pocketed tech companies is a daunting prospect for cable networks, whose businesses are in irreversible decline.
Disney executives have been emphatic that ESPN's future lies in streaming. Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the sports network was laying the groundwork to make its primary channel, which has long existed only on cable, available to streaming viewers. That would create a turning point for traditional TV distributors, which have staved off decline by offering live sports to cable subscribers.
CNBC earlier reported that professional sports leagues were in talks to take a stake in ESPN.
Disney has also faced pressure from a series of activist investors, including Trian Fund Management. The firm's founder, Nelson Peltz, who planned to push for Disney to improve its succession planning, called off a fight for a board seat this year. The firm has roughly 6.4 million shares in Disney, said a person familiar with the size of the holdings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon, Google and Meta are among the companies that announced the guidelines as they race to outdo each other with versions of artificial intelligence.
Seven leading A.I. companies in the United States have agreed to voluntary safeguards on the technology's development, the White House announced on Friday, pledging to manage the risks of the new tools even as they compete over the potential of artificial intelligence.
The seven companies -- Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI -- formally made their commitment to new standards for safety, security and trust at a meeting with President Biden at the White House on Friday afternoon.
"We must be cleareyed and vigilant about the threats emerging from emerging technologies that can pose -- don't have to but can pose -- to our democracy and our values," Mr. Biden said in brief remarks from the Roosevelt Room at the White House.
"This is a serious responsibility; we have to get it right," he said, flanked by the executives from the companies. "And there's enormous, enormous potential upside as well."
The announcement comes as the companies are racing to outdo each other with versions of A.I. that offer powerful new ways to create text, photos, music and video without human input. But the technological leaps have prompted fears about the spread of disinformation and dire warnings of a "risk of extinction" as artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and humanlike.
The voluntary safeguards are only an early, tentative step as Washington and governments across the world seek to put in place legal and regulatory frameworks for the development of artificial intelligence. The agreements include testing products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot A.I.-generated material.
But lawmakers have struggled to regulate social media and other technologies in ways that keep up with the rapidly evolving technology.
The White House offered no details of a forthcoming presidential executive order that aims to deal with another problem: how to control the ability of China and other competitors to get ahold of the new artificial intelligence programs, or the components used to develop them.
The order is expected to involve new restrictions on advanced semiconductors and restrictions on the export of the large language models. Those are hard to secure -- much of the software can fit, compressed, on a thumb drive.
An executive order could provoke more opposition from the industry than Friday's voluntary commitments, which experts said were already reflected in the practices of the companies involved. The promises will not restrain the plans of the A.I. companies nor hinder the development of their technologies. And as voluntary commitments, they will not be enforced by government regulators.
"We are pleased to make these voluntary commitments alongside others in the sector," Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, said in a statement. "They are an important first step in ensuring responsible guardrails are established for A.I. and they create a model for other governments to follow."
As part of the safeguards, the companies agreed to security testing, in part by independent experts; research on bias and privacy concerns; information sharing about risks with governments and other organizations; development of tools to fight societal challenges like climate change; and transparency measures to identify A.I.-generated material.
In a statement announcing the agreements, the Biden administration said the companies must ensure that "innovation doesn't come at the expense of Americans' rights and safety."
"Companies that are developing these emerging technologies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe," the administration said in a statement.
Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft and one of the executives attending the White House meeting, said his company endorsed the voluntary safeguards.
"By moving quickly, the White House's commitments create a foundation to help ensure the promise of A.I. stays ahead of its risks," Mr. Smith said.
Anna Makanju, the vice president of global affairs at OpenAI, described the announcement as "part of our ongoing collaboration with governments, civil society organizations and others around the world to advance AI governance."
For the companies, the standards described Friday serve two purposes: as an effort to forestall, or shape, legislative and regulatory moves with self-policing, and a signal that they are dealing with the new technology thoughtfully and proactively.
But the rules on which they agreed are largely the lowest common denominator, and can be interpreted by every company differently. For example, the firms committed to strict cybersecurity measures around the data used to make the language models on which generative A.I. programs are developed. But there is no specificity about what that means, and the companies would have an interest in protecting their intellectual property anyway.
And even the most careful companies are vulnerable. Microsoft, one of the firms attending the White House event with Mr. Biden, scrambled last week to counter a Chinese government-organized hack on the private emails of American officials who were dealing with China. It now appears that China stole, or somehow obtained, a "private key" held by Microsoft that is the key to authenticating emails -- one of the company's most closely guarded pieces of code.
Given such risks, the agreement is unlikely to slow the efforts to pass legislation and impose regulation on the emerging technology.
Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, said that more needed to be done to protect against the dangers that artificial intelligence posed to society.
"The voluntary commitments announced today are not enforceable, which is why it's vital that Congress, together with the White House, promptly crafts legislation requiring transparency, privacy protections, and stepped-up research on the wide range of risks posed by generative A.I.," Mr. Barrett said in a statement.
European regulators are poised to adopt A.I. laws later this year, which has prompted many of the companies to encourage U.S. regulations. Several lawmakers have introduced bills that include licensing for A.I. companies to release their technologies, the creation of a federal agency to oversee the industry, and data privacy requirements. But members of Congress are far from agreement on rules.
Lawmakers have been grappling with how to address the ascent of A.I. technology, with some focused on risks to consumers and others acutely concerned about falling behind adversaries, particularly China, in the race for dominance in the field.
This week, the House committee on competition with China sent bipartisan letters to U.S.-based venture capital firms, demanding a reckoning over investments they had made in Chinese A.I. and semiconductor companies. For months, a variety of House and Senate panels have been questioning the A.I. industry's most influential entrepreneurs and critics to determine what sort of legislative guardrails and incentives Congress ought to be exploring.
Many of those witnesses, including Sam Altman of OpenAI, have implored lawmakers to regulate the A.I. industry, pointing out the potential for the new technology to cause undue harm. But that regulation has been slow to get underway in Congress, where many lawmakers still struggle to grasp what exactly A.I. technology is.
In an attempt to improve lawmakers' understanding, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, began a series of sessions this summer to hear from government officials and experts about the merits and dangers of artificial intelligence across a number of fields.

Full text: Our TV critic recommends a snappy new comedy, a grounded drama and an absurd spin on a postapocalyptic tale.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I love zingers.
'Praise Petey'
When to watch: Friday at 10 p.m., on Freeform.
Petey (voiced by Annie Murphy) is a New York fashion girlie whose long-lost father has left her an odd inheritance: the cult he founded and led. Now it's her turn at the helm, and she finds she likes being revered, even if the small-town vibes take a little getting used to. The show has the quick banter of "Harley Quinn" and the entertainment industry digs of "The Other Two"; it's more like "Solar Opposites" than any of the teen-centric shows on Freeform. Two episodes air each week.
... three hours, and I want a grounded drama.
'Pure'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
Marnie (Charly Clive) is like a lot of recent TV heroines: smart and depressed, a little stuck, living in London and struggling to find her way after college. She also suffers from intrusive and unwanted sexual thoughts -- a nonstop X-rated ticker in the back of her mind that leaves her feeling poisoned and isolated, especially before she learns this is a form of O.C.D. "Pure" is not a misery parade, though; the characters are funny and the show is bouncy and vibrant, serious but not self-serious. If you like "This Way Up," "Can't Cope, Won't Cope" or "Extraordinary," try this.
... a few hours, and I like when things are the same but different.
'Miracle Workers'
When to watch: Now, on Max (Seasons 1-3) and the TBS website (Season 4).
Season 1 of this inventive, absurd anthology comedy is set in a bureaucratic afterlife; Season 2 in the dark ages; Season 3 on the Oregon Trail and the current season in the "end times," a warped desert where humanity scrounges for existence following "the boom." But this is a snarky postapocalyptic world, one with all the same social anxieties we have now, like a New Yorker-cartoon version of "Mad Max." Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Buscemi return, now playing a warrior who's trying to settle down and the junkyard baron who gives him a job. "Miracle" is smart and surprisingly whimsical, a tricky blend but magical when done right. The show has the inglorious distinction of being the last live-action scripted show on TBS, so enjoy it while it lasts.

Supersizing Computers And Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new supercomputer, made by the Silicon Valley start-up Cerebras, was unveiled as the A.I. boom drives demand for chips and computing power.
Inside a cavernous room this week in a one-story building in Santa Clara, Calif., six-and-a-half-foot-tall machines whirred behind white cabinets. The machines made up a new supercomputer that had become operational just last month.
The supercomputer, which was unveiled on Thursday by Cerebras, a Silicon Valley start-up, was built with the company's specialized chips, which are designed to power artificial intelligence products. The chips stand out for their size -- like that of a dinner plate, or 56 times as large as a chip commonly used for A.I. Each Cerebras chip packs the computing power of hundreds of traditional chips.
Cerebras said it had built the supercomputer for G42, an A.I. company. G42 said it planned to use the supercomputer to create and power A.I. products for the Middle East.
"What we're showing here is that there is an opportunity to build a very large, dedicated A.I. supercomputer," said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras. He added that his start-up wanted "to show the world that this work can be done faster, it can be done with less energy, it can be done for lower cost."
Demand for computing power and A.I. chips has skyrocketed this year, fueled by a worldwide A.I. boom. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Google, as well as myriad start-ups, have rushed to roll out A.I. products in recent months after the A.I.-powered ChatGPT chatbot went viral for the eerily humanlike prose it could generate.
But making A.I. products typically requires significant amounts of computing power and specialized chips, leading to a ferocious hunt for more of those technologies. In May, Nvidia, the leading maker of chips used to power A.I. systems, said appetite for its products -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- was so strong that its quarterly sales would be more than 50 percent above Wall Street estimates. The forecast sent Nvidia's market value soaring above $ 1 trillion.
"For the first time, we're seeing a huge jump in the computer requirements" because of A.I. technologies, said Ronen Dar, a founder of Run:AI, a start-up in Tel Aviv that helps companies develop A.I. models. That has "created a huge demand" for specialized chips, he added, and companies have "rushed to secure access" to them.
To get their hands on enough A.I. chips, some of the biggest tech companies -- including Google, Amazon, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel -- have developed their own alternatives. Start-ups such as Cerebras, Graphcore, Groq and SambaNova have also joined the race, aiming to break into the market that Nvidia has dominated.
Chips are set to play such a key role in A.I. that they could change the balance of power among tech companies and even nations. The Biden administration, for one, has recently weighed restrictions on the sale of A.I. chips to China, with some American officials saying China's A.I. abilities could pose a national security threat to the United States by enhancing Beijing's military and security apparatus.
A.I. supercomputers have been built before, including by Nvidia. But it's rare for start-ups to create them.
Cerebras, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was founded in 2016 by Mr. Feldman and four other engineers, with the goal of building hardware that speeds up A.I. development. Over the years, the company has raised $ 740 million, including from Sam Altman, who leads the A.I. lab OpenAI, and venture capital firms such as Benchmark. Cerebras is valued at $ 4.1 billion.
Because the chips that are typically used to power A.I. are small -- often the size of a postage stamp -- it takes hundreds or even thousands of them to process a complicated A.I. model. In 2019, Cerebras took the wraps off what it claimed was the largest computer chip ever built, and Mr. Feldman has said its chips can train A.I. systems between 100 and 1,000 times as fast as existing hardware.
G42, the Abu Dhabi company, started working with Cerebras in 2021. It used a Cerebras system in April to train an Arabic version of ChatGPT.
In May, G42 asked Cerebras to build a network of supercomputers in different parts of the world. Talal Al Kaissi, the chief executive of G42 Cloud, a subsidiary of G42, said the cutting-edge technology would allow his company to make chatbots and to use A.I. to analyze genomic and preventive care data.
But the demand for GPUs was so high that it was hard to obtain enough to build a supercomputer. Cerebras's technology was both available and cost-effective, Mr. Al Kaissi said. So Cerebras used its chips to build the supercomputer for G42 in just 10 days, Mr. Feldman said.
"The time scale was reduced tremendously," Mr. Al Kaissi said.
Over the next year, Cerebras said, it plans to build two more supercomputers for G42 -- one in Texas and one in North Carolina -- and, after that, six more distributed across the world. It is calling this network Condor Galaxy.
Start-ups are nonetheless likely to find it difficult to compete against Nvidia, said Chris Manning, a computer scientist at Stanford whose research focuses on A.I. That's because people who build A.I. models are accustomed to using software that works on Nvidia's A.I. chips, he said.
Other start-ups have also tried entering the A.I. chips market, yet many have "effectively failed," Dr. Manning said.
But Mr. Feldman said he was hopeful. Many A.I. businesses do not want to be locked in only with Nvidia, he said, and there is global demand for other powerful chips like those from Cerebras.
"We hope this moves A.I. forward," he said.

Strange Feeling Pervades Jets' Camp: 'A Lot of Positivity Around Here': [Sports Desk]

Full text: Adding Rodgers, the star quarterback, to a team with young talent and a strong defense has players eyeing the Super Bowl. It is a big jump for a franchise that has missed the past 12 postseasons.
For a brief moment on Thursday, Aaron Rodgers and the Jets showed everyone what rejuvenation looks like.
After a rocky few opening series during a scrimmage on the Jets' first day of training camp, Rodgers fired the ball to the second-year wide receiver Garrett Wilson on a quick out route. Wilson hauled in the pass, briefly stumbled, then scampered up the sideline for a healthy gain, drawing cheers from his energized teammates.
It was the sort of offensive dynamism the Jets have sorely missed for years as the team has struggled to find a long-term answer at quarterback, the game's most important position. The addition of Brett Favre in 2008 failed to deliver a playoff appearance, and early-round draft picks after him brought mixed results.
But the arrival of Rodgers, a four-time most valuable player, brings heightened expectations this season -- and an unfamiliar level of excitement around a team whose name has been synonymous with ineptitude for more than a decade.
"There's a lot of positivity around here, which I think is a good thing," Rodgers said after practice.
Following a long negotiation, the Jets agreed to acquire Rodgers in a trade with the Green Bay Packers on April 24, adding a level of spectacle that has trailed the team. The league scheduled the Jets in five prime time matchups this season, up from one appearance in 2022, including a Week 1 contest against the Buffalo Bills on "Monday Night Football." Camera crews from "Hard Knocks," the HBO documentary series, will follow the team throughout the season, and the Jets will headline the N.F.L.'s first Black Friday game, on Amazon.
The attention is a far cry from expectations ahead of last season. The Jets got out to a surprising 6-3 start behind a highly ranked defense before shaky quarterback play derailed newfound hopes. Zach Wilson, the No. 2 overall pick in 2021, was benched in favor of the backup quarterback Mike White, and the team went 1-7 to close the season.
By adding Rodgers, the Jets sought to expedite an organizational rebuild. The team has nurtured young talent, including the reigning offensive and defensive rookies of the year, Garrett Wilson and cornerback Sauce Gardner.
"When you have so many great players on rookie deals, it's pretty exciting knowing you can do something, you've got a good window," Rodgers said. "It's not just a one-year thing where you can be competitive, which is fun."
As players reported to camp on Wednesday, some spoke of reaching the Super Bowl, a lofty goal for a franchise that last made the postseason in 2010.
"Bringing a guy like him into the building just excites everyone in general because the résumé he has, the character he is, the guy that he is, that brings a spark to everybody," said defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who said he had already pelted Rodgers with questions about the best defensive players he had ever faced.
But even with Rodgers's arrival, there is reason for any optimism to be qualified.
Rodgers, who turns 40 in December, is up against football's age clock: Few quarterbacks -- apart from Tom Brady -- have excelled at that stage of their careers. And after winning back-to-back M.V.P. awards in 2020 and 2021, Rodgers had the worst season of his career as a full-time starter, posting his second-highest interception total and his lowest quarterback rating since 2008.
Rodgers brings more than just a Hall of Fame résumé to the Jets. He drew criticism in 2021 for denouncing the league's Covid-19 vaccination policy after testing positive for the coronavirus. Despite claiming before the season that he had been "immunized" against the virus, Rodgers was fined for violating league Covid-19 protocols for unvaccinated players by attending a Halloween party.
The end of Rodgers's tenure in Green Bay was also marred by his spats with coaches and team management over roster and play-calling decisions, as well as his public criticism of the Packers' young receivers.
So far, he said, he is happy with his new team.
"There's a lot of fun things that have come along with this time in my life, and I'm just enjoying every minute of it," he said on Thursday.
For their part, the Jets appear to have tried to build the team in Rodgers's image. They have Garrett Wilson, the sort of explosive young wide receiver that Rodgers had complained about missing in Green Bay. They brought in some of Rodgers's friends and former Packers teammates, like the receivers Randall Cobb and Allen Lazard and offensive lineman Billy Turner, and they hired Nathaniel Hackett, Rodgers's offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2021, in the same role.
Lazard, who played five seasons with Rodgers in Green Bay and signed with the Jets in March, thinks he can help some of the team's younger receivers, acknowledging that "the Aaron Rodgers offense" can present a learning curve.
"When he's on the field, the whole playbook's open at any given time," Lazard said of Rodgers. "Even during Day 1 of practice, he might pull a signal, do something we've never talked about."
It certainly will not be what the Jets have been used to.

U.S. Seeks To Sharpen Tools to Stop Tech Mergers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The proposed road map for regulatory reviews, last updated in 2020, includes a focus on tech platforms for the first time.
The Biden administration's top antitrust officials unveiled tougher guidelines against tech mergers on Wednesday, signaling their deepening scrutiny of the industry despite recent court losses in their attempts to block tech deal-making.
Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Department of Justice, released draft guidelines for merger reviews that for the first time include a focus on digital platforms and how dominant companies can use their scale to harm future rivals.
The guidelines -- which generally provide a road map for whether regulators block or approve deals -- show the Biden administration's commitment to an aggressive antitrust agenda aimed at curtailing the power of companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon.
The guidelines, which aren't enforced by law, follow a losing streak in the courts. A ruling last week prevented the F.T.C. from delaying the closing of Microsoft's $ 69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard. In January, a court sided against the F.T.C. in its lawsuit to stop Meta's purchase of Within, a virtual reality app maker.
The forceful antitrust posture is a pillar of President Biden's agenda to stamp out economic inequality and encourage greater competition. "Promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses and entrepreneurs is a central part of Bidenomics," a senior administration official said in a call with reporters.
The new guidelines would apply to all deals across the economy. But they highlight obstacles to competition among digital platforms, including how an acquisition of a nascent rival may be intended to kill off future competition. Such deals, known as killer acquisitions, are prevalent in the tech industry and at the heart of an F.T.C. antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has accused Meta of buying Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to prevent future competition.
The F.T.C. and Justice Department also said they would look at how companies used their scale, including their large number of users, to ward off competition. These so-called network effects have helped companies like Meta and Google maintain their dominance in social media and internet search.
The agencies also laid out ways in which mergers involving "platform" businesses, the model used by Amazon's online store and Apple's App Store, could harm competition. An acquisition could hurt competition by giving a platform control over a significant stream of data, the draft guidelines said, echoing concerns that tech giants use their vast troves of information to squash rivals.
"As markets and commercial realities change, it is vital that we adapt our law enforcement tools to keep pace so that we can protect competition in a manner that reflects the intricacies of our modern economy," Mr. Kanter said in a statement. "Simply put, competition today looks different than it did 50 -- or even 15 -- years ago."
While they lack the force of law, the guidelines can influence how judges look at challenges to mergers and acquisitions. The effort to update the guidelines has been closely watched by businesses and corporate lawyers that navigate regulatory scrutiny of megadeals.
The guidelines were last updated in 2020. In 2021, Mr. Biden ordered the Justice Department and the F.T.C. to update them again as part of a broader effort to improve competition across the economy. The agencies will take public comment on the proposals and could make amendments before final guidelines are adopted.
"These guidelines contain critical updates while ensuring fidelity to the mandate Congress has given us and the legal precedent on the books," Ms. Khan said in a statement.
While the F.T.C. experienced the recent court losses, it has forced some companies, including the chip-maker Nvidia and the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, to abandon some large deals. The Justice Department blocked the publisher Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster, using an unusual argument that the merger would harm authors who sold the publication rights to their books.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actors' union and the organization that bargains on behalf of the studios traded statements underscoring how much work needs to be done to reach an agreement.
As tens of thousands of actors go into their fifth day of a strike versus the Hollywood studios, the two sides have shown no signs of returning to the bargaining table -- and are even exchanging barbed messages that underscore how far apart they are.
Late Monday, leadership of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, sent members a 12-page memo laying out its demands and the studios' counterproposals. They "remain far apart on the most critical issues that affect the very survival of our profession," the note said.
"We marched ahead because they intentionally dragged their feet," it continued.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that bargains on behalf of the studios, answered with a note to the news media arguing that the message from the union "deliberately distorts" the offers it had made.
"A strike is not the outcome we wanted," the alliance said. "For SAG-AFTRA to assert that we have not been responsive to the needs of its membership is disingenuous at best."
Thousands of Hollywood actors went on strike on Friday after failing to reach a new contract with the major studios, including old-line companies like Paramount, Universal and Disney and tech giants like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
The actors joined 11,500 screenwriters who went on strike 78 days ago, the first time both unions had walked out at the same time since 1960. The writers have not returned to the bargaining table with the studios since their negotiations collapsed in early May.
SAG-AFTRA's note said the two sides remained far apart on several key issues, including compensation, guardrails against artificial intelligence, and health care and pension costs.
The union's leadership said it had asked for 11 percent wage increases in the first year of a new contract; the studios came back with an offer of 5 percent, the union said.
When it comes to artificial intelligence, the union's leaders said they had argued for a number of provisions to protect them "when a 'digital replica' is made or our performance is changed using A.I."
They said the studio alliance "failed to address many vital concerns, leaving principal performers and background actors vulnerable to having most of their work replaced by digital replicas."
The studios said that the union's note to its members "fails to include the proposals offered verbally" during negotiations, and that its overall package was worth more than $ 1 billion in wage increases, improvements on residuals (a type of royalty) and health care contributions.
Regarding artificial intelligence, the studios said they had offered a "groundbreaking proposal, which protects performers' digital likenesses, including a requirement for performer's consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance."
Union leadership sent out a chart laying out each proposal and the studios' response. Over more than two dozen proposals, the studio response amounted to one word, according to the union: "Rejected."
"So who's making the T-Shirt that says 'Rejected'?" the actress Senta Moses posted on Twitter.
"This is why we're on strike," the union note said. "The A.M.P.T.P. thinks we will relent, but the will of our membership has never been stronger. We have the resolve and unity needed to defend our rights."

Full text: In a raunchy, rollicking post-pandemic (not that one) comedy from New Zealand, the men are gone but the women are as nasty to one another as ever.
Contains many spoilers for Season 1 of "Creamerie."
The New Zealand post-viral-apocalypse comedy "Creamerie" likes to begin an episode right where the previous one left off. So the show's second season, which premiered Saturday on Hulu, begins mid-cliffhanger: Its three heroines cowering and aghast as they watch their mean-girl nemesis French kiss the traitorous man they thought they loved. (One of them is his sister, another his widow. It's complicated.) Underscoring the action are the moans of the naked men in the background who are attached, like dairy cattle, to stainless steel tubes that are rhythmically collecting their semen.
Oh, did I forget to mention that the viral apocalypse in question only killed humans with Y chromosomes? "Creamerie" is in the science fiction subgenre of world-without-men shows; others include the new Netflix anime "Ooku: The Inner Chambers" and FX on Hulu's "Y: The Last Man" from 2021. These are actually, almost invariably, world-with-a-handful-of-men shows, since much of their pleasure comes from seeing what happens when the power balance is reversed.
"Creamerie" was created by the actresses who play the leads -- J.J. Fong, Perlina Lau and Ally Xue -- along with the writer and director Roseanne Liang. The four have been collaborators for a decade, making Web series about relatably snarky young women in urban New Zealand. What distinguishes "Creamerie" is how seamlessly it incorporates the raunchy, silly, casually comic vibe of those online shorts (along with their female point of view) into a sci-fi-series framework. It's a clever but unassuming show, which is why its package of laughs, sentiment, consciousness raising and low-budget Saturday-serial action has considerable appeal.
Fong, Lau and Xue play Jamie (determined, sorrowful, sexy), Pip (uptight, repressed, resourceful), and Alex (rebellious, profane, loyal), the proprietors of a dairy farm in rural New Zealand. (That they're in the milk business is a joke that pays off in full with the reveal of the semen farm at the end of Season 1.) Eight years before, a virus was thought to have killed all men and it continues to kill male embryos; the survival of the remaining half of the human race is presumed to depend on the leftover inventory of sperm banks, which is distributed by lottery to prospective mothers.
The fundamental question of these shows is how women would act if they were in charge, and the answer "Creamerie" offers is deflating but comically fertile: They would be really, really mean. The area around the farm is governed by Nordic-featured, yoga-toned, ecru-linen-wearing Amazons, led by Lane (the excellent Tandi Wright), an unholy cross of Gwyneth Paltrow and Martha Stewart who wields "wellness" as a tool of oppression. In the new world ruled by women, if you question authority, you are dispatched for a lobotomy -- it's called being permed -- and if you don't fit the right physical and racial mold, your place in society may be tending cows in the countryside.
Of course, Lane and her cohorts are keeping secret the existence of a few surviving men, one of whom, Bobby (Jay Ryan), shows up at the farm. His arrival turns Jamie, Pip and Alex into reluctant insurgents, sending them on an antic, highly messy journey of discovery, liberation and violent payback, one that continues through the second season against ever greater odds.
Liang, who has directed all 12 episodes of "Creamerie" and written them with several other writers, primarily Dan Musgrove, is best known for the rousing 2020 action-horror feature "Shadow in the Cloud." Starring Chloë Grace Moretz, a B-17 bomber and a toothy special-effects gremlin, the film played like an extended, well-choreographed "Twilight Zone" episode. Like "Creamerie," it wasn't that deep or self-serious, but the confidence and brio with which it was made gave weight to its mix of feminist and maternal motifs and to its emotional payoffs.
Something similar happens in the series: the jokes, the shambolic action and the matter-of-fact satire of gender, race and class alchemize into something funnier and more moving than you might expect. Fong, Lau and Xue aren't, individually, expert comic performers, but together they have a rapport and timing that expertly serve the material.
In Season 2 the scope of the story expands, moving into Auckland, where the national government is led by a gently woke prime minister (Isabella Austin) with pink-and-blue hair and a furry green hipster hat. The heroines continue to find improbable escapes from their increasingly perilous situations, falling out and making up with one another in classic buddy-comedy fashion. And they remain gloriously themselves, no matter how dire things get.
Waking up after being tranquilized, not knowing where she is or why, Pip frantically checks her hair, in a joke that reaches back to the characters Lau plays in the collective's online shorts. Against the notion of a female utopia, "Creamerie" stubbornly insists on the primary value of the individual.

Meta Unveils Its New A.I. With Pledge To Share It: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company said it would give outside programmers access to the latest version of its core artificial intelligence technology.
The largest companies in the tech industry have spent the year warning that development of artificial intelligence technology is outpacing their wildest expectations and that they need to limit who has access to it.
Mark Zuckerberg is doubling down on a different tack: He's giving it away.
Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, said on Tuesday that he planned to provide the code behind the company's latest and most advanced A.I. technology to developers and software enthusiasts around the world free of charge.
The decision, similar to one that Meta made in February, could help the company reel in competitors like Google and Microsoft. Those companies have moved more quickly to incorporate generative artificial intelligence -- the technology behind OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot -- into their products.
"When software is open, more people can scrutinize it to identify and fix potential issues," Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to his personal Facebook page.
The latest version of Meta's A.I. was created with 40 percent more data than what the company released just a few months ago and is believed to be considerably more powerful. And Meta is providing a detailed road map that shows how developers can work with the vast amount of data it has collected.
Researchers worry that generative A.I. can supercharge the amount of disinformation and spam on the internet, and presents dangers that even some of its creators do not entirely understand.
Meta is sticking to a long-held belief that allowing all sorts of programmers to tinker with technology is the best way to improve it. Until recently, most A.I. researchers agreed with that. But in the past year, companies like Google and OpenAI, a San Francisco start-up that is working closely with Microsoft, have set limits on who has access to their latest technology and placed controls around what can be done with it.
The companies say they are limiting access because of safety concerns, but critics say they are also trying to stifle competition. Meta argues that it is in everyone's best interest to share what it is working on.
"Meta has historically been a big proponent of open platforms, and it has really worked well for us as a company," said Ahmad Al-Dahle, vice president of generative A.I. at Meta, in an interview.
The move will make the software "open source," which is computer code that can be freely copied, modified and reused. The technology, called LLaMA 2, provides everything anyone would need to build online chatbots like ChatGPT. LLaMA 2 will be released under a commercial license, which means developers can build their own businesses using Meta's underlying A.I. to power them -- all for free.
By open-sourcing LLaMA 2, Meta can capitalize on improvements made by programmers from outside the company while -- Meta executives hope -- spurring A.I. experimentation.
Meta's open-source approach is not new. Companies often open-source technologies in an effort to catch up with rivals. Fifteen years ago, Google open-sourced its Android mobile operating system to better compete with Apple's iPhone. While the iPhone had an early lead, Android eventually became the dominant software used in smartphones.
But researchers argue that someone could deploy Meta's A.I. without the safeguards that tech giants like Google and Microsoft often use to suppress toxic content. Newly created open-source models could be used, for instance, to flood the internet with even more spam, financial scams and disinformation.
LLaMA 2, short for Large Language Model Meta AI, is what scientists call a large language model, or L.L.M. Chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard are built with large language models.
The models are systems that learn skills by analyzing enormous volumes of digital text, including Wikipedia articles, books, online forum conversations and chat logs. By pinpointing patterns in the text, these systems learn to generate text of their own, including term papers, poetry and computer code. They can even carry on a conversation.
Meta is teaming up with Microsoft to open-source LLaMA 2, which will run on Microsoft's Azure cloud services. LLaMA 2 will also be available through other providers, including Amazon Web Services and the company HuggingFace.
Dozens of Silicon Valley technologists signed a statement of support for the initiative, including the venture capitalist Reid Hoffman and executives from Nvidia, Palo Alto Networks, Zoom and Dropbox.
Meta is not the only company to push for open-source A.I. projects. The Technology Innovation Institute produced Falcon LLM and published the code freely this year. Mosaic ML also offers open-source software for training L.L.M.s.
Meta executives argue that their strategy is not as risky as many believe. They say that people can already generate large amounts of disinformation and hate speech without using A.I., and that such toxic material can be tightly restricted by Meta's social networks such as Facebook. They maintain that releasing the technology can eventually strengthen the ability of Meta and other companies to fight back against abuses of the software.
Meta did additional "Red Team" testing of LLaMA 2 before releasing it, Mr. Al-Dahle said. That is a term for testing software for potential misuse and figuring out ways to protect against such abuse. The company will also release a responsible-use guide containing best practices and guidelines for developers who wish to build programs using the code.
But these tests and guidelines apply to only one of the models that Meta is releasing, which will be trained and fine-tuned in a way that contains guardrails and inhibits misuse. Developers will also be able to use the code to create chatbots and programs without guardrails, a move that skeptics see as a risk.
In February, Meta released the first version of LLaMA to academics, government researchers and others. The company also allowed academics to download LLaMA after it had been trained on vast amounts of digital text. Scientists call this process "releasing the weights."
It was a notable move because analyzing all that digital data requires vast computing and financial resources. With the weights, anyone can build a chatbot far more cheaply and easily than from scratch.
Many in the tech industry believed Meta set a dangerous precedent, and after Meta shared its A.I. technology with a small group of academics in February, one of the researchers leaked the technology onto the public internet.
In a recent opinion piece in The Financial Times, Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global public policy, argued that it was "not sustainable to keep foundational technology in the hands of just a few large corporations," and that historically companies that released open source software had been served strategically as well.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what you all build!" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his post.

Full text: Meet Harriet Goldberg, a late bloomer who went from a career in social work to the queen of hold music with her 2011 song "My Time to Fly."
Harriet Goldberg is the composer of what may be one of the most heard songs in the world today.
This 74-year-old New Jersey native is, in her own words, a "late blooming, part-time musician," who has never played a live gig and is unknown to the music industry at large.
But every day since 2017, Goldberg's jazzy instrumental, "My Time to Fly," has been served up to countless callers who are put on hold by the customer service lines of businesses large and small. These include Capital One, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Costco, Nasdaq, the Kansas Unemployment Office, Sagami Railway in Japan, Dartmoor Prison in England, scores of hotels and restaurants and, yes, The New York Times.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Goldberg's journey from a career in social work to the queen of hold music is an unlikely one. It's the product of a passion that wasn't acted on until she was in her late 40s.
"When I was a kid, my family got a free piano," Goldberg said in a phone interview from her home in Boston. "My dad wrote songs and played jazz as a hobby. I studied a little classical but mainly played folk, rock and the Beatles -- the usual stuff for a child of the '60s."
She went on to earn a bachelor's degree in English from Boston University and a master's in social work, and in her late 30s became a stay-at-home mother.
"In my late 40s, my interest in jazz deepened, mainly standards and cabaret music," she said. "I started composing songs based on the songs I loved. I knew my limitations and wanted to find someone who could help me with my writing."
Looking for a mentor, Goldberg turned to an old friend, the saxophonist Billy Novick, a onetime Berklee College of Music student who has appeared on more than 250 recordings, film and television scores and performed with artists including David Bromberg, Maria Muldaur, Willie Dixon and J. Geils.
"Harriet and I knew each other for years and our collaboration started very organically," Novick said in a phone interview from his home in Lexington, Mass. "She would show me her compositions and I would make suggestions to modify chord structure, melody and the like."
After a few years, Goldberg had enough songs to record an album. The result was "Bring Back the Moonlight," from 2002, a 14-track collection of vocal tunes modeled on the lush classics she loved. Novick created arrangements, booked the studio and engineer, and found the musicians who played and sang on this and four more albums Goldberg self-released through 2021.
Aware there were better opportunities for Goldberg's compositions to be licensed as incidental music in film and television if they were instrumentals, Novick suggested she record wordless versions of her songs, most crucially, the title track to her 2011 album, "My Time to Fly." But before this tune took off on phones, Goldberg gained a foothold by entering a song from her debut disc, "Suddenly You Walked By," into a songwriting contest sponsored by Billboard magazine. Though she didn't win the top prize, she earned a membership with Taxi, a firm that helps composers place music in film and television. By 2008, Goldberg was working with another catalog service, Crucial Music, and began having her music featured in shows, including "Californication," "Hawaii 5-0" and "New Amsterdam."
In 2017, the time came for "My Time to Fly."
"We were working with Amazon, placing music in their films and television shows, when they asked us for music for Amazon Connect, a service that manages the call centers for tens of thousands of businesses worldwide, handling 10 million calls in a day," Tanvi Patel, the chief executive of Crucial Music, said in an interview, noting that jazz is one of the top genres for hold music.
Goldberg's instrumental is "very upbeat and it really swings," Patel added. "It sets a relaxed mood for what can be one of life's more trying situations."
Goldberg, however, didn't know anything about her place atop the on-hold hit parade until 2019, when she heard from her collaborator.
"I was on hold with Capital One Bank and heard something familiar," Novick said. "My first impression was I liked the sax player, but I honestly couldn't pin it down. I listened again, opened my Shazam app and found out it was one of the songs I recorded with Harriet."
While Goldberg's tune may be spinning more than any other at the moment, it isn't earning her untold riches. The licensing agreement with Amazon was a buyout, earning Harriet a "four-figure flat fee" for its use in perpetuity.
But the song has earned this late bloomer unexpected fandom -- and some money. Through its release on her own label, Goldberg is making a modest income from streams, downloads and occasional CD sales. She is also garnering positive messages from fans via email and her SoundCloud page. The song's popularity in Japan was even subject of a skit on "Tamori Club," a sort of Japanese "Saturday Night Live."
"I've gotten many wonderful emails from around the world about the song," she said. "The notoriety is very sweet, especially for a song that is thrust upon people as they are in what can turn into an unpleasant situation if it's too long a wait.
"It's especially funny," Goldberg added, "when I call my bank and get put on hold and it's my own music that I have to listen to."
Dane Vannatter, the cabaret singer featured on the vocal version of "My Time to Fly," sometimes performs it at club gigs.
"Before he sings it, he holds up his phone and plays the instrumental version," Goldberg said. "Then, he asks how many people have heard the tune. It's usually most of the audience though they never can quite place exactly where they heard it."

Harriet Goldberg is the composer of what may be one of the most heard songs in the world today.
This 74-year-old New Jersey native is, in her own words, a “late blooming, part-time musician,” who has never played a live gig and is unknown to the music industry at large.
But every day since 2017, Goldberg’s jazzy instrumental, “My Time to Fly,” has been served up to countless callers who are put on hold by the customer service lines of businesses large and small. These include Capital One, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Costco, Nasdaq, the Kansas Unemployment Office, Sagami Railway in Japan, Dartmoor Prison in England, scores of hotels and restaurants and, yes, The New York Times.
Goldberg’s journey from a career in social work to the queen of hold music is an unlikely one. It’s the product of a passion that wasn’t acted on until she was in her late 40s.
“When I was a kid, my family got a free piano,” Goldberg said in a phone interview from her home in Boston. “My dad wrote songs and played jazz as a hobby. I studied a little classical but mainly played folk, rock and the Beatles — the usual stuff for a child of the ’60s.”
She went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in English from Boston University and a master’s in social work, and in her late 30s became a stay-at-home mother.
“In my late 40s, my interest in jazz deepened, mainly standards and cabaret music,” she said. “I started composing songs based on the songs I loved. I knew my limitations and wanted to find someone who could help me with my writing.”
Looking for a mentor, Goldberg turned to an old friend, the saxophonist Billy Novick, a onetime Berklee College of Music student who has appeared on more than 250 recordings, film and television scores and performed with artists including David Bromberg, Maria Muldaur, Willie Dixon and J. Geils.
“Harriet and I knew each other for years and our collaboration started very organically,” Novick said in a phone interview from his home in Lexington, Massachusetts. “She would show me her compositions and I would make suggestions to modify chord structure, melody and the like.”
After a few years, Goldberg had enough songs to record an album. The result was “Bring Back the Moonlight,” from 2002, a 14-track collection of vocal tunes modeled on the lush classics she loved. Novick created arrangements, booked the studio and engineer, and found the musicians who played and sang on this and four more albums Goldberg self-released through 2021.
Aware there were better opportunities for Goldberg’s compositions to be licensed as incidental music in film and television if they were instrumentals, Novick suggested she record wordless versions of her songs, most crucially, the title track to her 2011 album, “My Time to Fly.” But before this tune took off on phones, Goldberg gained a foothold by entering a song from her debut disc, “Suddenly You Walked By,” into a songwriting contest sponsored by Billboard magazine. Though she didn’t win the top prize, she earned a membership with Taxi, a firm that helps composers place music in film and television. By 2008, Goldberg was working with another catalog service, Crucial Music, and began having her music featured in shows, including “Californication,” “Hawaii 5-0” and “New Amsterdam.”
In 2017, the time came for “My Time to Fly.”
“We were working with Amazon, placing music in their films and television shows, when they asked us for music for Amazon Connect, a service that manages the call centers for tens of thousands of businesses worldwide, handling 10 million calls in a day,” Tanvi Patel, the chief executive of Crucial Music, said in an interview, noting that jazz is one of the top genres for hold music.
Goldberg’s instrumental is “very upbeat and it really swings,” Patel added. “It sets a relaxed mood for what can be one of life’s more trying situations.”
Goldberg, however, didn’t know anything about her place atop the on-hold hit parade until 2019, when she heard from her collaborator.
“I was on hold with Capital One Bank and heard something familiar,” Novick said. “My first impression was I liked the sax player, but I honestly couldn’t pin it down. I listened again, opened my Shazam app and found out it was one of the songs I recorded with Harriet.”
While Goldberg’s tune may be spinning more than any other at the moment, it isn’t earning her untold riches. The licensing agreement with Amazon was a buyout, earning Harriet a “four-figure flat fee” for its use in perpetuity.
But the song has earned this late bloomer unexpected fandom — and some money. Through its release on her own label, Goldberg is making a modest income from streams, downloads and occasional CD sales. She is also garnering positive messages from fans via email and her SoundCloud page. The song’s popularity in Japan was even subject of a skit on “Tamori Club,” a sort of Japanese “Saturday Night Live.”
“I’ve gotten many wonderful emails from around the world about the song,” she said. “The notoriety is very sweet, especially for a song that is thrust upon people as they are in what can turn into an unpleasant situation if it’s too long a wait.
“It’s especially funny,” Goldberg added, “when I call my bank and get put on hold and it’s my own music that I have to listen to.”
Dane Vannatter, the cabaret singer featured on the vocal version of “My Time to Fly,” sometimes performs it at club gigs.
“Before he sings it, he holds up his phone and plays the instrumental version,” Goldberg said. “Then, he asks how many people have heard the tune. It’s usually most of the audience, though they never can quite place exactly where they heard it.”

As Another Grain Deal Deadline Nears, Russia Says It May Back Out, Again: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Russia has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the wartime export agreement, which has helped stabilize global grain prices and avert famines. The latest deadline to renew it is Monday.
The United Nations on Sunday awaited a response from Russia on renewing a deal that allows Ukraine to export its grain amid a wartime blockade, a necessity in helping keep global food prices stable.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, is a rare example of fruitful negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion. The deal was initially reached a year ago, allowing Ukraine to restart the export of millions of tons of grain that had languished for months.
But Russia has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the deal, which has been renewed only for short periods. The last day of the latest extension is Monday.
In a bid to answer one of Russia's key demands before this latest deadline, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, sent a letter to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last week with proposals that would "remove hurdles affecting financial transactions" through Russia's agricultural bank "and simultaneously allow for the continued flow of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea," according to a U.N. statement.
Two days later, Mr. Putin called the deal a "one-sided game," again threatening to pull out of it because of what he considered unmet conditions, Tass, Russia's state news agency, reported. "We may suspend our participation in this agreement. And if everyone reiterates that all promises given to us will be fulfilled -- let them fulfill these promises. And we will immediately join this agreement. Again," he said, according to Tass.
One cargo ship departed the Ukrainian port of Odesa on Sunday, bound for the Netherlands. The last shipment before that had been Thursday.
Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said Sunday in an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation" that it wasn't clear what Mr. Putin would decide.
"We are prepared for any scenario, and we're working closely with the Ukrainians on that," he said.
The invasion prompted the United States and European countries to tighten sanctions on Russia, effectively turning it into a pariah state. Some analysts have argued that Moscow is trying to use the grain deal as leverage to soften these sanctions.
Russia has complained that while the agreement has allowed Ukraine's food exports to reach markets, the Western sanctions have restricted the sale of Russia's agricultural products, and it has demanded that steps be taken to facilitate its own exports of grain and fertilizers. The Kremlin's other demands included restoring an ammonia pipeline that crosses Ukraine to facilitate exports, but Ukraine has refused to grant consent.
The deal was first brokered to alleviate a global food crisis exacerbated when Russia effectively blockaded Ukrainian ports at the start of its invasion. Ukraine is a major exporter of grain and other food crops, and global wheat prices soared. Although Ukraine's allies began accepting more shipments over land, there was little choice but to strike a deal with Russia to ease the crisis and allow Ukrainian farmers to continue producing.
Since the Black Sea Grain Initiative began, Ukraine has used it to export 32.8 million tons of grain and other foodstuffs, according to U.N. data, and the agreement has prevented hunger crises from worsening in some countries in the Middle East and Africa.
Under the deal, Ukrainian corn and wheat are the leading exports, with 90 percent of corn and 60 percent of wheat shipped to high- or middle-income countries. The volumes shipped to low-income countries are roughly the same as before the invasion, according to U.N. data.
But the volume of grain exported from the Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea has been slowing in recent weeks, according to U.N. data. The same thing happened weeks before the deal's previous expiration date, in May.
Under the terms of the deal, Ukraine's ships have been given safe passage to the port in Istanbul, where inspectors have checked them. Empty ships have also been checked in Istanbul en route to Ukraine's ports to verify that they are not carrying weapons or other goods banned under the agreement.
Here's what else is happening in the war:
Speaking to Russian state TV, Mr. Putin said in clips released on Sunday that Ukraine's monthlong counteroffensive -- which has so far captured a few miles of territory -- "has not had success," and that Russian forces were holding out throughout the front line. Mr. Putin added that Russia was even staging its own attacks in some areas. On Sunday afternoon, a Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said in a Telegram post that Russian forces have been conducting offensive operations near Kupiansk, a city in the Kharkiv region, and in parts of the Donetsk region.
In the clips from the state TV interview, which airs on Sunday evening in Russia, Mr. Putin also said that the recent decision by the United States to send cluster munitions to Ukraine showed the scale of ammunition shortages facing Kyiv, adding that Russia may retaliate if these weapons are deployed on the battlefield. Mr. Putin falsely claimed that Russia had not used cluster munitions in Ukraine despite dozens of cases documented by the United Nations, mostly in the early months of the war.
The Russian president's comments, which were released by the Kremlin on Sunday, raise the prospect of much wider deployment of cluster munitions in the conflict, which would threaten to cover the area of the fighting with unexploded ordnance for years, posing a significant risk to civilians.
Britain's defense secretary, Ben Wallace, told The Sunday Times of London that he would resign from his post, probably in the coming months, after four years in the role. Britain has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies since Russia's full-scale invasion began. Mr. Wallace said last week that Ukraine should show more gratitude for Britain's military support, adding, "We're not Amazon," comments that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak distanced himself from.

Why Deep-Sea Mining Is the Next Battleground in the Energy Transition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Countries and companies are in a fight between those that want to excavate minerals used in electric vehicles and others that warn the cost is too high.
Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
"We're preparing our application," said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.
The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, "but we reserve the right to move forward."
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether -- though it's not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don't yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean -- and transporting metals back to land -- raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works -- like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries -- could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. "This industry could start without being needed," she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.
"Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean," Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet "through decades of profit-driven development" as "patronizing."
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. "That horse has bolted," he said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Lina Khan's bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT's privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.
The details behind the PGA Tour-LIV Golf talks. A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn't have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.
Meeting over at Shopify. The Canadian e-commerce company embedded a calculator in employees' calendar apps that measures the financial cost of meetings with three or more people. It's the company's latest effort to stop pointless gatherings. It had previously canceled all recurring meetings of more than two people.
Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday's Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.
How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $ 11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $ 4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $ 200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The "political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech," Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.
Paris takes on 'auto-besity'
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on "auto-besity." Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the vehicles -- a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. "We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles," Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was "to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity ... the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities."
The new rules will add to carmakers' worries. Details haven't been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.
"France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars," Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla's price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are "in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below."
On our radar: A.I. as a villain
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," the latest installment in Tom Cruise's efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $ 90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.
Over decades, humans' relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Ex Machina" and, yes, "A.I." But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for "mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I."? The Entity is capable of "collapsing the world's economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim." At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide -- and time will tell if that mission is ... well, you know.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you on Monday.

We May Not Be Ready for an All-E.V. World: [Op-Ed]

Full text: I get why the Biden administration is pushing electric vehicles so hard. To stop the planet from overheating, we'll eventually need motor vehicles to produce zero greenhouse gas emissions, and only fully electric vehicles can do that. Hybrids, which have combustion engines along with electric motors, will always puff some carbon dioxide (and other bad stuff) out of their tailpipes.
Right now, though, there's a good argument to be made that the government, and automakers, are leaning too hard into all-electric and neglecting the virtues of hybrid technology. When I first heard this counterintuitive argument from Toyota, I dismissed it as heel-dragging by a company that lags in electrics, but I've come around to the idea that hybrids -- at least for now -- do have a lot of advantages over all-electric vehicles.
Imagine some wheelbarrows filled with rocks. The rocks contain lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, graphite and other materials for lithium-ion batteries. By Toyota's calculation, the amount of rocks needed for one long-range electric vehicle would be enough for either six plug-in hybrids or 90 of the type of hybrid that can't be plugged in for a recharge. (Namely, the type whose batteries are recharged from the engine or from braking.)
"The overall carbon reduction of those 90 hybrids over their lifetimes is 37 times as much as a single battery electric vehicle," Toyota argues. That's a stunning statistic if true.
"People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority," Toyota's then chief executive, Akio Toyoda, told reporters on a trip to Thailand in December, according to The Wall Street Journal. "That silent majority is wondering whether E.V.s are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it's the trend so they can't speak out loudly."
Lobbying against an all-electric approach is what you might expect from an automaker that bet heavily on hydrogen fuel cells and hybrids and has only a sliver of the market in E.V.s that run on batteries. I have no doubt that Toyota is motivated at least in part by self-interest. But some people I spoke with who aren't connected with the company had similar views.
"Toyota's claim is accurate. We've crunched the numbers on this," Ashley Nunes told me. He is a senior research associate at Harvard Law School and the director for federal policy, climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank. He testified on the topic in April before the House Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing and Critical Materials.
I'll speed through his points. Electric vehicles consume huge quantities of lithium and other materials because they have huge batteries. And they have huge batteries because customers suffer from "range anxiety" and won't buy an E.V. unless it can go for hundreds of miles without charging -- even though the vast majority of trips are short. The Nissan Leaf gets 149 miles with its standard battery, which seems like enough for most purposes, yet Nissan sold just 12,026 Leafs (Leaves?) last year.
Partly because of ever-bigger batteries, E.V.s are getting more expensive on average, not cheaper as was predicted. They are out of many buyers' price range. Some people will keep driving old ICE-mobiles (cars with internal combustion engines) because they can't afford an E.V. And those ICE-mobiles will continue to be major emitters of greenhouse gases.
The production of electric vehicles produces more greenhouse gases than the production of cars with combustion engines. So E.V.s have to travel between 28,000 and 68,000 miles before they have an emissions advantage over similarly sized and equipped ICE-mobiles, according to Nunes. That may take 10 years or more if the E.V. isn't driven much.
Then there's the problem of where to get all the minerals. Domestic production, even combined with extensive recycling, can't meet the need for cobalt, graphite, lithium and manganese, Nunes wrote in his prepared House testimony. Allies could help, but they're also ramping up consumption. "There is, to put it bluntly, only so much mineral supply to go around," he wrote. Lithium iron phosphate is a promising alternative battery chemistry, but its energy density is lower, so batteries would have to be even bigger to give the same range. (Sodium-ion batteries and solid-state lithium-ion batteries are other options.)
The Biden administration clearly doesn't trust electric vehicles to win over the buying public purely on their merits. That's why in April the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032.
That would be a wrenching change. It sometimes seems like E.V.s are everywhere, but in reality they accounted for just 5.8 percent of new cars sold in the United States last year, The Times reported. All-electric trucks accounted for less than 2 percent of new heavy trucks.
Of course, drivers could be bribed into buying E.V.s if enough money were thrust in their faces. But Nunes said that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced far more cost-effectively through subsidies of clean power generation, particularly wind turbines.
For another perspective, I exchanged emails with Nafisa Lohawala, a Ph.D. economist who is a fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank. She focused on the benefits of plug-in hybrids, which use less metal than all-electric E.V.s but more than non-pluggable hybrids. "From consumers' perspective," she wrote, "having a gasoline backup helps alleviate range anxiety, allowing them to adopt plug-in hybrids even when the charging network around them is sparse. Moreover, given their lower price, middle- and low-income communities would also find adopting them easier than battery electric vehicles."
Lohawala wrote that if drivers recharge their plug-in hybrids frequently, they'll be able to run on battery power almost all the time and emissions will be almost as low as with an all-electric E.V. That will tend to happen as more charging stations with faster chargers are installed. "As long as the battery ranges of plug-in hybrids are reasonably long and the electricity prices are low, consumers would voluntarily charge them rather than relying on gasoline," she wrote.
Again, I get that climate change is an existential crisis. (Take it from my Opinion colleague, David Wallace-Wells.) I also get that hybrids aren't as clean as all-electric E.V.s. "The fact is: A hybrid today is not green technology," Katherine García, the director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign, wrote last year. "The Prius hybrid runs on a pollution-emitting combustion engine found in any gas-powered car."
However, getting to the destination of all-electric for all will take more minerals, better battery chemistry and more and better chargers, among other things. That's a big project. For now, hybrids seem like a valuable part of the vehicle mix.

Amazon is in a world of hurt. They entered an established category (groceries) with entrenched competitors, including Walmart. I like to compare the position Amazon is in to that of the French forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The French thought they had a superior army. The Viet Minh placed their focus on having a superior strategy. The French forces had to surrender.

Full text: The entertainment industry is trying to figure out the economics of streaming. It's also facing angst over a tech-powered future and fighting to stay culturally dominant.
Existential hand-wringing has always been part of Hollywood's personality. But the crisis in which the entertainment capital now finds itself is different.
Instead of one unwelcome disruption to face -- the VCR boom of the 1980s, for instance -- or even overlapping ones (streaming, the pandemic), the movie and television business is being buffeted on a dizzying number of fronts. And no one seems to have any solutions.
On Friday, roughly 160,000 unionized actors went on strike for the first time in 43 years, saying they were fed up with exorbitant pay for entertainment moguls and worried about not receiving a fair share of the spoils of a streaming-dominated future. They joined 11,500 already striking screenwriters, who walked out in May over similar concerns, including the threat of artificial intelligence. Actors and writers had not been on strike at the same time since 1960.
"The industry that we once knew -- when I did 'The Nanny' -- everybody was part of the gravy train," Fran Drescher, the former sitcom star and the president of the actors' union, said while announcing the walkout. "Now it's a walled-in vacuum."
At the same time, Hollywood's two traditional businesses, the box office and television channels, are both badly broken.
This was the year when moviegoing was finally supposed to bounce back from the pandemic, which closed many theaters for months on end. At last, cinemas would reclaim a position of cultural urgency.
But ticket sales in the United States and Canada for the year to date (about $ 4.9 billion) are down 21 percent from the same period in 2019, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Blips of hope, including strong sales for "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," have been blotted out by disappointing results for expensive films like "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," "Elemental," "The Flash," "Shazam! Fury of the Gods" and, to a lesser extent, "The Little Mermaid" and "Fast X."
The number of movie tickets sold globally may reach 7.2 billion in 2027, according to a recent report from the accounting firm PwC. Attendance totaled 7.9 billion in 2019.
It's a slowly dying business, but it's at least better than a quickly dying one. Fewer than 50 million homes will pay for cable or satellite television by 2027, down from 64 million today and 100 million seven years ago, according to PwC. When it comes to traditional television, "the world has forever changed for the worse," Michael Nathanson, an analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount Global and WarnerBros. Discovery have relied for decades on television channels for fat profit growth. The end of that era has resulted in stock-price malaise. Disney shares have fallen 55 percent from their peak in March 2021. Paramount Global, which owns channels like MTV and CBS, has experienced an 83 percent decline over the same period.
On Thursday, Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, put the sale of the company's "noncore" channels, including ABC and FX, on the table. He called the decline in traditional television "a reality we have to come to grips with."
In other words, it's over.
And then there is streaming. For a time, Wall Street was mesmerized by the subscriber-siphoning potential of services like Disney+, Max, Hulu, Paramount+ and Peacock, so the big Hollywood companies poured money into building online viewing platforms. Netflix was conquering the world. Amazon had arrived in Hollywood determined to make inroads, as had the ultra-deep-pocketed Apple. If the older entertainment companies wanted to remain competitive -- not to mention relevant -- there was only one direction to run.
"You now have, really in control, tech companies who haven't a care or clue, so to speak, about the entertainment business -- it's not a pejorative, it's just the reality," Barry Diller, the media veteran, said by phone this past week, referring to Amazon and Apple.
"For each of these companies," he added, "their minor business, not their major business, is entertainment. And yet, because of their size and influence, their minor interests are paramount in making any decisions about the future."
A little over a year ago, Netflix reported a subscriber loss for the first time in a decade, and Wall Street's interest swiveled. Forget subscribers. Now we care about profits -- at least when it comes to the old-line companies, because their traditional businesses (box office and channels) are in trouble.
To make services like Disney+, Paramount+ and Max (formerly HBO Max) profitable, their parent companies have slashed billions of dollars in costs and eliminated more than 10,000 jobs. Studio executives also put the brakes on ordering new television series last year to rein in costs.
WarnerBros. Discovery has said its streaming business, anchored by Max, will be profitable in 2023. Disney has promised profitability by September 2024, while Paramount had not forecast a date, except to say peak losses will occur this year, according to Rich Greenfield, a founder of the LightShed Partners research firm.
Giving in to union demands, which would threaten streaming profitability anew, is not something the companies will do without a fight.
"In the short term, there will be pain," said Tara Kole, a founding partner of JSSK, an entertainment law firm that counts Emma Stone, Adam McKay and Halle Berry as clients. "A lot of pain."
Every indication points to a long and destructive standoff. Agents who have worked in show business for 40 years said the anger surging through Hollywood exceeded anything they had ever seen.
"Straight out of 'Les Miz"' was how one longtime executive described the high-drama, us-against-them mood in a text to a reporter. Photos circulating online from this past week's Allen & Company Sun Valley media conference, the annual "billionaires' summer camp" attended by Hollywood's haves, inflamed the situation.
On a Paramount Pictures picket line on Friday, Ms. Drescher attacked Mr. Iger, something few people in Hollywood would dare to do without the cloak of anonymity. She criticized his pay package (his performance-based contract allows for up to $ 27 million annually, including stock awards, which is middle of the road for entertainment chief executives) and likened him and other Hollywood moguls to "land barons of a medieval time."
"It's so obvious that he has no clue as to what is really happening on the ground," she added. Mr. Iger had told CNBC on Thursday that the demands by the two unions were "just not realistic."
In the coming weeks, studios will probably cancel lucrative long-term deals with writers (and some actor-producers) by virtue of the force majeure clause in their contracts, which kick in on the 60th or 90th day of a strike, depending on how the agreements are structured. The force majeure clause states that when unforeseeable circumstances prevent someone from fulfilling a contract, the studios can cancel the deal without paying a penalty.
Eventually, contracts with the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, will be hammered out.
The deeper business challenges will remain.

2nd Strike Grinds Studios to a Halt: [National Desk]

Full text: The dual walkouts pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney and Sony, as well as tech juggernauts like Netflix and Amazon.
The Hollywood actors' union approved a strike on Thursday for the first time in 43 years, bringing the $ 134 billion American movie and television business to a halt over anger about pay and fears of a tech-dominated future.
The leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 television and movie actors, announced the strike after negotiations with studios over a new contract collapsed, with streaming services and artificial intelligence at the center of the standoff. On Friday, the actors will join screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, on picket lines in New York, Los Angeles and the dozens of other American cities where scripted shows and movies are made.
Actors and screenwriters had not been on strike at the same time since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films and Ronald Reagan was the head of the actors' union. Dual strikes pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal, Sony and Paramount, as well tech juggernauts like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us!" Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, said at a news conference on Thursday in Los Angeles. "How far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their C.E.O.s. It is disgusting. Shame on them!"
Shaking her fists in anger, Ms. Drescher noted that "the entire business model has been changed" by streaming and that artificial intelligence would soon change it more. "This is a moment in history -- a moment of truth," she said. "At some point, you have to say, 'No, we're not going to take this anymore."'
Many of the actors' demands mirror those of the writers, who belong to the Writers Guild of America. Both unions say they are trying to ensure living wages for workaday members, in particular those making movies or television shows for streaming services.
Screenwriters are afraid studios will use A.I. to generate scripts. Actors worry that the technology could be used to create digital replicas of their likenesses (or that performances could be digitally altered) without payment or approval.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said it had worked to reach a reasonable deal at a difficult time for an industry upended by the streaming revolution, which the pandemic sped up.
"The union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry," the alliance said in a news release that outlined 14 areas where studios had offered "historic" contract improvements. Those included, according to the alliance, an 11 percent pay increase in the contract's first year for background actors, stand-ins and photo doubles and a 76 percent increase in residual payments for "high-budget" shows that stream overseas.
The alliance added in a separate statement: "We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations. This is the union's choice, not ours."
Behind the scenes, studio executives responded to Ms. Drescher's fury in varying ways. Some said they had underestimated her ability to lead the sometimes-fractious actors' union -- discounting her as little more than the cartoonish figure she played on "The Nanny" for six seasons in the 1990s. Others continued to mock her as giving an Academy Award-caliber performance at the union's news conference.
Though Hollywood had been bracing for a writers' strike since the beginning of the year -- screenwriters have walked out eight times over the past seven decades, most recently in 2007 -- the actors' uncharacteristic resolve caught senior executives and producers off guard.
The actors last staged a major walkout in 1980, when the economic particulars of a still-nascent boom in home video rentals and sales was a sticking point. Their latest action is part of a resurgent labor movement, particularly in California, where hotel workers, school bus drivers, teachers and cafeteria staff have all gone on strike for some duration in recent months.
The first distress signal for the studios came in early June when roughly 65,000 members of the actors' union voted to authorize a strike. Almost 98 percent of the voters supported the authorization, a figure that narrowly eclipsed the writers' margin.
Still, studio negotiators went into the talks feeling optimistic. They were taken aback when they saw the list of proposals from the union -- it totaled 48 pages, nearly triple the size of the list during their last negotiations in 2020, according to two people familiar with the proposals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential talks.
Then in late June, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep, John Leguizamo, Jennifer Lawrence, Constance Wu and Ben Stiller, signed a letter to guild leadership, declaring pointedly that "we are prepared to strike."
The Hollywood studios will now need to navigate a two-front labor war with no modern playbook to consult. There are many open questions, including whether the actors and the writers may demand that future negotiations with the studios be conducted in tandem. One guild that will not be included: the Directors Guild of America, which ratified a contract last month.
The actors' walkout will provide an immediate boon to the striking writers, who have been walking picket lines for more than 70 days; the Writers Guild has yet to return to bargaining with the studios. Now those picket lines are likely to be raucous and star-studded spectacles -- struggling thespians still trying to get a foothold next to A-listers with bodyguards who are paid $ 20 million or more per movie role.
The strikes are the latest monumental blow to an entertainment industry that has been rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The Hollywood studios have watched their share prices nose-dive and their profit margins shrink as viewership for cable and network television -- as well as box office returns -- has collapsed in the wake of the explosive growth of streaming entertainment.
Many companies have resorted to layoffs, as well as purging series from their streaming services, all in the name of trying to increase profit margins and satisfy recalcitrant investors. Studio executives had already put the brakes on ordering new television series last year as their streaming services continued to burn through cash.
In an interview on CNBC on Thursday morning, Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said that given all the "disruptive forces" in the business, "this is worst time in the world to add to that disruption."
Barry Diller, the veteran media executive, said in an interview that the recent upheaval in the industry had caused distress for both sides.
"You have a complete change in the underlying economics of the entertainment business that it previously held for certainly the last 50 years, if not the last 100 years," he said. "Everything was basically in balance under the hegemony of five major studios, and then, oh, my God, along come the tech companies in Netflix, Amazon and Apple and the fast, transformative things that came out of Covid. The result of which is you have a business that's just completely upended."
After the strike announcement, the union issued rules for its members. Along with not being able to work in front of the camera, they will not be permitted to promote current projects. That includes attending Comic-Con, film festivals and movie premieres.
That means actors will not be able to promote movies during an all-important stretch for the summer box office, when big-budget films like "Barbie," "Oppenheimer" and "Haunted Mansion" are released.
Some of those promotional opportunities have already disappeared: Late-night shows like "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" have been running only repeat episodes during the writers' strike.
The effects of the dual strikes should be noticeable to viewers within a couple of months. Unless there is an immediate resolution to the labor disputes, the ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly lineups of reality series and game shows -- including "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune," "Dancing With the Stars" and "Judge Steve Harvey" -- as well as repeats of "Abbott Elementary."
If the strikes drag into the fall, blockbuster films scheduled to be released next summer, like "Deadpool 3," could be delayed.

Wall St. Stays on Track for Winning Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street's winning streak barreled into a fourth day Thursday following the latest signal that inflation is easing its chokehold on the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 37.88, or 0.8 percent, to 4,510.04 and its highest close since April 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.71, or 0.1 percent, to 34,395.14, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 219.61, or 1.6 percent, to 14,138.57 as Big Tech stocks led the way.
The S&P 500 is on track for its seventh winning week in the last nine after more data raised hopes that inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to soon end its blistering run of hikes to interest rates. Inflation at the wholesale level slowed more than expected in June, and prices paid by producers were just 0.1 percent higher during the month than a year earlier. That's down from 11.2 percent inflation last summer.
High inflation has been the main reason investors have been fearing a possible recession, because of how high the Federal Reserve has cranked interest rates to get prices under control. High rates undercut inflation by bluntly slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for investments. They can also cause unanticipated parts of the economy to break.
Traders remain nearly convinced the Fed will raise the federal funds rate at its next meeting in two weeks to its highest level since 2001. But this week's inflation data has also pushed traders to build bets for that to be the final rate increase of this cycle.
A report on Wednesday showed that prices consumers paid in June were 3 percent higher than a year earlier, down from inflation of more than 9 percent last summer. It's been a "cool summer breeze," as Deutsche Bank economists describe it.
Treasury yields fell further in the bond market as traders pared bets for Fed rate hikes later this year.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.76 percent from 3.86 percent late Wednesday and from 3.98 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield fell to 4.63 percent from 4.75 percent late Wednesday and from 4.89 percent late Tuesday. It moves more on expectations for action by the Fed.
The drop for yields accelerated after James Bullard said in the afternoon that he's stepping down as president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank to join Purdue University's business school as its dean next month. He was one of the loudest voices at the Fed pushing for higher rates to control inflation.
Easier interest rates help all kinds of investments. But many investors see big technology and other high-growth stocks among the biggest beneficiaries.
That had Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia among the strongest forces pushing up the S&P 500. Amazon gained 2.7 percent after it said the first day of its annual Prime Day event on Tuesday was the biggest sales day in its history.
Alphabet rose 4.7 percent after Google said it's rolling out Bard, its chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, to more countries around the world and launching new features for it.
Nvidia, which has been at the center of a frenzy on Wall Street around AI, rose 4.7 percent.
PepsiCo added 2.4 percent after it beat analysts' profit expectations for the spring. It saw lower demand for drinks and snacks, but higher prices helped its earnings. PepsiCo also raised its forecasts for results for the full year.
The earnings reporting season is just getting underway, and JPMorgan Chase will lead a barrage of banks on Friday that will tell investors how much they made during the spring. Expectations overall are dim, and analysts are forecasting the sharpest drop in earnings for S&P 500 companies since the pandemic was walloping the global economy in the spring of 2020.
A resilient job market has nevertheless been keeping the economy out of a recession. A report on Thursday showed fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. To be sure, too strong of a job market could also push the Federal Reserve to get more aggressive about interest rates and inflation.
While inflation is showing encouraging signals, Wall Street may be piling too quickly into a consensus that it will keep cooling enough for the Federal Reserve to ease up on rates and prevent a recession, warned Chun Wang, senior research analyst and co-portfolio manager at Leuthold.
In a report, Wang said the market may be underestimating the risk that inflation stays stuck at 3 percent to 4 percent in the next six to 12 months and that "the path forward for both inflation and the Fed policy is not a no-brainer at all. We get the sneaking suspicion that the current soft landing narrative will be seriously challenged before the first leaf falls from the tree."
On the losing side of Wall Street Thursday was Exxon Mobil. It fell 1.8 percent after saying it would buy Denbury, which owns carbon dioxide pipelines, for $ 4.9 billion in stock. Denbury fell 1.3 percent.

Rate Hawk at the Fed Will Take a Post at Purdue
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, who pushed for aggressive interest rate increases to curb high inflation, will leave his position next month to join Purdue University's business school. Bullard, who has led the St. Louis Fed since 2008 and is the Fed's longest-serving current policymaker, will stay on in an advisory role at the regional bank until Aug. 14 before taking up a post. He will not take part in the policy deliberations or the rate-setting decision at the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting this month, according to a statement from the St. Louis Fed. Bullard was in the vanguard of Fed policymakers calling for action to rein in a surge in inflation in the run-up to the launch of the Fed's tightening campaign in March 2022, and has maintained a hawkish posture in his public pronouncements. He will leave the Fed as it moves toward the endgame of its tightening cycle. REUTERS
LABOR
Threatened UPS Strike Could Be Among Costliest
A threatened U.S. strike at United Parcel Service could be "one of the costliest in at least a century," topping $ 7 billion for a 10-day work stoppage, a think tank specializing in the economic impact of labor actions said on Thursday. That estimate from Michiganbased Anderson Economic Group includes UPS customer losses of $ 4 billion and lost direct wages of more than $ 1 billion. A 15-day strike in 1997 disrupted the supply of goods, cost the world's biggest parcel delivery firm $ 850 million and sent some customers to rivals like FedEx. Roughly 340,000 union-represented UPS workers handle about a quarter of U.S. parcel deliveries and serve virtually every city and town in the nation. A strike could delay millions of daily deliveries, including Amazon.com orders, electronic components and lifesaving prescription drugs, shipping experts warned. Talks are deadlocked between UPS and the Teamsters union, which has vowed to strike if a deal is not ratified before midnight on July 31. REUTERS

Exxon Pipeline Purchase Features Carbon Capture
Exxon Mobil is buying the pipeline operator Denbury, the beneficiary of changes in U.S. climate policy that intended to reduce the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. The all-stock deal is valued at $ 4.9 billion. Carbon capture and storage involves removing carbon dioxide, either from the source of pollution or from the air at large, and storing it deep underground. In some instances, the carbon dioxide is transported across states through pipelines and stored at facilities and used for other things. The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law last year by President Biden infuses nearly $ 375 billion over the decade in climate change-fighting strategies that could cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030, including carbon capture operations. Exxon said Thursday the acquisition gives it the largest owned and operated carbon dioxide pipeline network in the U.S. at 1,300 miles. ASSOCIATED PRESS

The Firewall Between Players and Designers: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: "Never Alone," which closes Sunday, was an important first step in breaking the firewall between art lovers and game designers.
When the Museum of Modern Art began collecting video games a decade ago, curators boldly asserted that games were an artistic medium. Now contemporary culture is dominated by them.
The MoMA exhibition "Never Alone: Video Games and Other Interactive Design," which runs through Sunday, represents the museum's cautious advance into the gaming world at a time when digital culture has overtaken its galleries. Refik Anadol's algorithmic homage to art history still twinkles in the museum lobby; an exhibition about the importance of video swallowed the sixth floor until July 8; and galleries for its permanent collection include contemporary artifacts like the Google Maps pin and a massive schematic devoted to the interlaced chain of resources needed to create an Amazon Echo as an artificial intelligence system.
However, the museum could do more to break the firewall between art lovers and game designers. After all, this is the same institution that began a film library in 1935, exhibited utilitarian toasters and cash registers as "Machine Art" in 1934 and presented modular houses in the 1950s. Curators need to unleash that same passion for games, which struggle in the current exhibition to convey the profundity, and complexity, of their designers' thinking.
On the first floor, old computer monitors cantilevered above visitors are drawn from the museum's collection of video games. Eleven are playable; 35 games in all are viewable. Jamming buttons on their keyboards, users were hard-pressed to crane their necks to see the flickering displays above them -- a series of digital experiments from the 1990s by John Maeda, a graphic designer who now serves as Microsoft's vice president of design and artificial intelligence.
MoMA's standards for assessing the cultural importance of video games require an upgrade worthy of the medium, whose revenue is projected to reach $ 385 billion in 2023 and technologies contribute to the ongoing A.I. revolution.
For the curators Paola Antonelli and Paul Galloway, gaming is a psychological act that has defined an era when many of our relationships are mediated through screens.
And the vision of designers like Will Wright is letting players choose what lessons they want to learn -- or nothing at all. One player might experience Wright's most popular game, The Sims (included in the MoMA exhibition), as a gateway into the worlds of architecture and interior decorating; another might focus on its family-planning aspect or its staging of murder mysteries and ghost encounters.
The decision to allow games into the museum has been debated since the 2010s, when critics like Roger Ebert and Jonathan Jones declared that the medium would never rise to the status of art.
"Chess is a great game, but even the finest chess player in the world isn't an artist," Jones opined in The Guardian, "She is a chess player."
At the center of these critiques was a belief that playtime belonged to children. A similar logic harmed performance art until museums started making the genre a staple in their programming, coincidentally, around the same time that MoMA started collecting games.
"People want to be taken to a new place," Donna De Salvo, a Whitney Museum curator said of performance art in 2012 during an interview with The New York Times. "In the age of the digital and the virtual and the mediated experience, there is something very visceral about watching live performance."
The same could be said for gaming, which embraces immersion by allowing players into their virtual worlds with the touch of a controller. The simplicity of that relationship is evident in the exhibition "Never Alone," where Zen games like Flower ask players to weave petals through the wind on a journey across an imaginary landscape. But the concept flows through the veins of modern gaming, ever since Super Mario 64 tasked players with jumping into paintings stored within a museum-like castle to progress through its story.
So what prevents museums from developing more ambitious programming around games? And why has a serious institution like MoMA not staged the first major retrospective of a video game designer when it has enough material for obvious picks like Will Wright or Shigeru Miyamoto?
There are a few practical reasons. Designers rarely own rights to their creations, which are held by the publishers financing their games. In an interview, Antonelli singled out other hurdles: legal negotiations, lost source codes and obsolete technology that challenge the acquisition process. And then there are the headaches involved with hard wiring all those electronic systems in the galleries.
Yet there seems no better time for MoMA's curators to show why gaming belongs in their museum and to help visitors to understand the difference between what is scholarship and what is for sale at the Nintendo store a few blocks down the street.

LOS ANGELES — The Hollywood actors’ union approved a strike on Thursday for the first time in 43 years, bringing the $134 billion American movie and television business to a halt over anger about pay and fears of a tech-dominated future.
The leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 television and movie actors, announced the strike after negotiations with studios over a new contract collapsed, with streaming services and artificial intelligence at the center of the standoff. On Friday, the actors will join screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, on picket lines in New York, Los Angeles and the dozens of other American cities where scripted shows and movies are made.
Actors and screenwriters had not been on strike at the same time since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films and Ronald Reagan was the head of the actors’ union. Dual strikes pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal, Sony and Paramount, as well as tech juggernauts like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
“I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us!” Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, said at a news conference on Thursday in Los Angeles. “How far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them!”
Shaking her fists in anger, Drescher noted that “the entire business model has been changed” by streaming and that artificial intelligence would soon change it more. “This is a moment in history — a moment of truth,” she said. “At some point, you have to say, ‘No, we’re not going to take this anymore.’”
Many of the actors’ demands mirror those of the writers, who belong to the Writers Guild of America. Both unions say they are trying to ensure living wages for workaday members, in particular those making movies or television shows for streaming services.
Screenwriters are afraid studios will use AI to generate scripts. Actors worry that the technology could be used to create digital replicas of their likenesses (or that performances could be digitally altered) without payment or approval.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said it had worked to reach a reasonable deal at a difficult time for an industry upended by the streaming revolution, which the pandemic sped up.
“The union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry,” the alliance said in a news release that outlined 14 areas where studios had offered “historic” contract improvements. Those included, according to the alliance, an 11% pay increase in the contract’s first year for background actors, stand-ins and photo doubles and a 76% increase in residual payments for “high-budget” shows that stream overseas.
The alliance added in a separate statement: “We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations. This is the union’s choice, not ours.”
Behind the scenes, studio executives responded to Drescher’s fury in varying ways. Some said they had underestimated her ability to lead the sometimes-fractious actors’ union — discounting her as little more than the cartoonish figure she played on “The Nanny” for six seasons in the 1990s. Others continued to mock her as giving an Academy Award-caliber performance at the union’s news conference.
Although Hollywood had been bracing for a writers’ strike since the beginning of the year — screenwriters have walked out eight times over the past seven decades, most recently in 2007 — the actors’ uncharacteristic resolve caught senior executives and producers off guard.
The actors last staged a major walkout in 1980, when the economic particulars of a still-nascent boom in home video rentals and sales was a sticking point. Their latest action is part of a resurgent labor movement, particularly in California, where hotel workers, school bus drivers, teachers and cafeteria staff have all gone on strike for some duration in recent months.
The first distress signal for the studios came in early June when roughly 65,000 members of the actors’ union voted to authorize a strike. Almost 98% of the voters supported the authorization, a figure that narrowly eclipsed the writers’ margin.
Still, studio negotiators went into the talks feeling optimistic. They were taken aback when they saw the list of proposals from the union — it totaled 48 pages, nearly triple the size of the list during their last negotiations in 2020, according to two people familiar with the proposals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential talks.
Then in late June, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep, John Leguizamo, Jennifer Lawrence, Constance Wu and Ben Stiller, signed a letter to guild leadership, declaring pointedly that “we are prepared to strike.”
The Hollywood studios will now need to navigate a two-front labor war with no modern playbook to consult. There are many open questions, including whether the actors and the writers may demand that future negotiations with the studios be conducted in tandem. One guild that will not be included: the Directors Guild of America, which ratified a contract last month.
The actors’ walkout will provide an immediate boon to the striking writers, who have been walking picket lines for more than 70 days; the Writers Guild has yet to return to bargaining with the studios. Now those picket lines are likely to be raucous and star-studded spectacles — struggling thespians still trying to get a foothold next to A-listers with bodyguards who are paid $20 million or more per movie role.
The strikes are the latest monumental blow to an entertainment industry that has been rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The Hollywood studios have watched their share prices nose-dive and their profit margins shrink as viewership for cable and network television — as well as box office returns — has collapsed in the wake of the explosive growth of streaming entertainment.
Many companies have resorted to layoffs, as well as purging series from their streaming services, all in the name of trying to increase profit margins and satisfy recalcitrant investors. Studio executives had already put the brakes on ordering new television series last year as their streaming services continued to burn through cash.
In an interview on CNBC on Thursday morning, Disney’s CEO, Robert Iger, said that given all the “disruptive forces” in the business, “this is worst time in the world to add to that disruption.”
Barry Diller, the veteran media executive, said in an interview that the recent upheaval in the industry had caused distress for both sides.
“You have a complete change in the underlying economics of the entertainment business that it previously held for certainly the last 50 years, if not the last 100 years,” he said. “Everything was basically in balance under the hegemony of five major studios, and then, oh, my God, along come the tech companies in Netflix, Amazon and Apple and the fast, transformative things that came out of COVID. The result of which is you have a business that’s just completely upended.”
After the strike announcement, the union issued rules for its members. Along with not being able to work in front of the camera, they will not be permitted to promote current projects. That includes attending Comic-Con, film festivals and movie premieres.
That means actors will not be able to promote movies during an all-important stretch for the summer box office, when big-budget films like “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and “Haunted Mansion” are released.
Some of those promotional opportunities have already disappeared: Late-night shows like “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” have been running only repeat episodes during the writers’ strike.
The effects of the dual strikes should be noticeable to viewers within a couple of months. Unless there is an immediate resolution to the labor disputes, the ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly lineups of reality series and game shows — including “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,” “Dancing With the Stars” and “Judge Steve Harvey” — as well as repeats of “Abbott Elementary.”
If the strikes drag into the fall, blockbuster films scheduled to be released next summer, like “Deadpool 3,” could be delayed.

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "It's Seven Grandkids, Mr. President," by Maureen Dowd (column, July 9), about her sister's letter to the president urging him to acknowledge a daughter fathered by Hunter Biden:
While I completely agree with Ms. Dowd and her sister that this little girl should be included in the Biden family, I feel the need to add one important reminder. As the mother of an addict (thankfully in recovery, although recovery is never a smooth journey), I know that one should never tell the family of someone who has wrestled with addiction what they "should" do. As in never, ever.
Trust me, the Bidens are in pain on this and so many other issues related to their struggling, courageous, flawed son. Perhaps in time they will make other choices about this precious little girl. But that's part of their journey, and advice written to pressure a family isn't helpful or fair to anyone.
Anne DeCocco
Raleigh, N.C.
To the Editor:
I completely disagree with Maureen Dowd. I welcomed a grandchild when my son was 19 and unmarried. But it was my choice, and if I had turned away for whatever private reason, I would not expect to be publicly condemned for it. Either way, it's a private decision.
Handling this family matter is between the birth parents of the child. It's not a situation for grandparents to overstep. This child, Navy Joan, has a family who loves her. Why should she be forced on one that doesn't?
If it weren't for the White House connection, we all would be more polite about expressing opinions about a child being forced on an 80-year-old grandfather and his family.
S. Donnelly
Cape Cod, Mass.
To the Editor:
I am a staunch supporter of President Biden from both a political and personal perspective. He has made considerable progress on bipartisan legislation and shows personal empathy and deep consideration for all Americans.
But I must applaud Ms. Dowd's column on the surprising tone deafness of the Biden family to their unacknowledged seventh grandchild. No matter the circumstances of her conception, she is a human being who deserves an extended family and who absolutely deserves acknowledgment of her existence.
Mr. Biden should know better than to consign an innocent little girl to a life of rejection and the inability to be embraced by all of her legitimate family. This is definitely not the Joe Biden I admire.
Jane C. Parker
New York
To the Editor:
Nothing has raised my ire more than Maureen Dowd's commentary. Ms. Dowd, Peggy, her sister, and all of us outside the Biden family -- leave them alone. That anyone is casting judgment on what is unequivocally a private matter is just plain wrong. Without walking in someone's shoes, what do we know or truly understand about others' lives?
Empathy, please, not gratuitous meddling.

A Bad Compromise on Serving Gay People
To the Editor:
Re "States Can Still Protect L.G.B.T.Q. Consumers" (Opinion guest essay, July 2):
While I appreciate Aaron Tang's effort to find a compromise that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and protects "the expressive freedom of people of faith," his solution is not a good one.
He proposes that states permit wedding web designers who object to same-sex marriages to farm out to employees or independent contractors any solicitations from gay or lesbian couples. That strategy, he says, would allow businesses to meet public accommodations requirements without forcing the owner or any like-minded employees to create content with which they disagree.
Nothing in current law prohibits an owner from assigning work to employees; if the proprietor of 303 Creative wanted to choose that option, she could. But to direct the customers to an independent contractor is akin to a restaurant that refuses to serve Black people telling the shunned patrons: "Go next door; they'll serve you."
That provides neither the equal access nor the equal dignity that public accommodations law requires.

Finding Support in Faith Communities
To the Editor:
Re "What Churches Offer That 'Nones' Still Long For," by Jessica Grose (newsletter, June 28):
To be sure, many spiritually curious people and spiritual seekers avoid organized religious communities out of an outdated assumption of being judged, criticized or condemned for their beliefs, practices or just being who they are.
Yet word to the contrary is getting out: Many churches, synagogues and other religious institutions are welcoming and affirming of multiracial, interfaith, uncertain, and L.G.B.T.Q.+ individuals and households.
There is a rebound of interest and activity in faith communities, post-Covid isolation, brought on by a new appreciation for what a safe and supportive congregation can provide. As one parent of young children said to me, "We need to be with each other, as if we are turning to the temple to make up for lost time during the pandemic."
I hope that more people see their local house of worship as an opportunity to kindle and enter new, nurturing and positive relationships in a spiritual community.

Indiana Jones and 'the Magic of Movies'
To the Editor:
Re "Unwrinkled or Not, Forever Battling the Nazis" (review, June 30):
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" isn't just a movie -- it's a time capsule. You open it up and you discover the magic of movies all over again.
There you are in a dark theater, among strangers, digging into your popcorn, your eyes transfixed on the action on the screen. There's Indiana Jones! And he's not just alive and well, but he's thriving! Crisscrossing the globe from New York to Morocco to Sicily. In search of the most elusive treasure of all!
Suddenly, you're a kid again, you're Jones's new 13-year-old sidekick, integral to the outcome of the story, finding your way in forbidden Italian caves, armed with your instincts and guile, and a newfound knowledge of Archimedes.
Who knows, maybe you'll become the next great archaeologist, maybe there's still time. You walk out of that theater and into the humid July night having been on the wildest ride you've ever been on, one you'll never forget. The summer's still ahead of you, and you wonder what other adventures await.
Thank you, Harrison Ford and James Mangold, the director, for giving us this treasure of a movie. May we protect it and the moviegoing experience for years to come.

Ron DeSantis and Goofy
To the Editor:
"Disney Fears Broadsides as DeSantis Campaigns" (Business, July 4):
If Disney wants to defang Ron DeSantis, it should do what it does best: communicate. I see a short cartoon. Goofy is sitting, reading a newspaper. He looks up and says, "I see DeSantis has said [pick out four or five of the nuttiest things DeSantis has said]."
Goofy makes a face and says, "And they say I'm goofy."

F.T.C. Losses Raise Doubts On Strategy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Kang, Cecilia

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lina Khan has said a fear of defeat should not deter the agency from suing big tech companies. But after Microsoft won a ruling this week, her critics say that strategy is flawed.
Lina Khan became chair of the Federal Trade Commission two years ago on a promise to bring bold action against the biggest tech companies.
For too long, Ms. Khan said at the time, the agency had been a weak cop and needed to challenge behemoths like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google in the courts to stem their growing power. Even if the F.T.C. lost the cases, she later added, they would be a partial victory because the agency would signal that antitrust laws needed to be updated for the modern internet era.
But on Tuesday, Ms. Khan suffered the biggest blow yet to her hallmark agenda. A federal judge rejected the F.T.C.'s attempt to stop Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard from closing, saying the agency failed to prove the deal would reduce competition and harm consumers. On Wednesday, the F.T.C. filed a notice that it would appeal the judge's decision.
That followed a loss in February, when a judge rejected an F.T.C. lawsuit seeking to block Meta from buying the virtual reality start-up Within.
The defeats raise questions about Ms. Khan's ability to carry out her ambitious goal of reversing decades of weak antitrust enforcement, as political pressure mounts and patience wanes for the 34-year-old academic, who has ruffled the feathers of corporate America. Ms. Khan's critics are more emboldened and are speaking out more loudly to poke holes in her take-it-to-the-courts strategy, saying the losses are not even partial wins -- they're just losses.
"I completely disagree with this approach," Anthony Sabino, a professor of business and law at St. John's University, said of Ms. Khan's methods. "She's trying to change a century's worth of antitrust law overnight, and that's not necessarily wise."
Adam Kovacevich, the chief executive of Chamber of Progress, a tech trade group, said the defeats made the F.T.C. appear less credible. "All these court losses are making their threats look more like a paper tiger," he said.
Others wondered if Ms. Khan was wasting the F.T.C.'s resources on can't-win cases. "They've crossed the line to being reckless with the cases they are bringing," said Ashley Baker, a director of public policy for Committee for Justice, a conservative think tank.
The tide of criticism puts Ms. Khan in the hot seat as she prepares further potential actions against the tech giants. The F.T.C. has filed antitrust suits against Meta and could bring a case against Amazon, which it has been investigating over claims of illegal monopolization.
Now Ms. Khan will first have to defend herself. On Thursday, she is expected to be grilled at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the F.T.C., with the Republican-led panel's website saying it wants to "examine mismanagement of the F.T.C. and its disregard for ethics and congressional oversight under Chair Lina Khan."
Ms. Khan declined to comment for this article, and Douglas Farrar, an F.T.C. spokesman, also declined to comment on how the court losses will affect her agenda. After the Microsoft-Activision ruling on Tuesday, Mr. Farrar said the agency was "disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services and consoles."
Ms. Khan rose to fame while a Yale law student in 2017 when she argued in a paper for a law journal that Amazon was crushing competition and violating antitrust laws despite lowering prices for consumers. The paper helped kick off a debate about how to limit the tech giants and how to modernize antitrust practices.
After President Biden picked Ms. Khan to lead the F.T.C., she repeatedly argued that it needed to go to court -- win or lose -- to send the tech industry a strong signal that the agency was becoming a tougher sheriff. Even losses in court, she maintained, would gradually reform theories of antitrust.
Ms. Khan applied that thinking when the F.T.C. sued to stop Meta last year from buying a small virtual-reality company, Within. The case was a surprise because virtual reality is a nascent technology, making it hard to argue that the deal would reduce competition in a market that has not yet formed.
But Ms. Khan argued that regulators must stop violations of competition and consumer protections at the bleeding edge of technology, not just in areas where the companies had already become behemoths.
"What we can see is that inaction after inaction after inaction can have severe costs," she said in an interview with The New York Times and CNBC in January 2022. "And that's what we're really trying to reverse."
Early this year, a federal judge rejected the F.T.C.'s demand to block Meta's acquisition of Within. But the judge agreed with some of the F.T.C.'s arguments, including how the agency defined tech markets in the case.
The loss on Tuesday in the Microsoft-Activision case was more stinging, partly because the blockbuster merger has become a test of whether tech megadeals can go through despite rising regulatory scrutiny. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said consumers benefited from Microsoft's expectation of a tough review, writing: "That scrutiny has paid off." But her ruling left little else that was redeeming for the F.T.C.
In the case, the agency argued that the deal should not close because it might harm competition. Microsoft might make some of Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox game consoles or degrade the experience of playing games like Activision's Call of Duty on competing consoles like Sony's PlayStation.
But Judge Corley wrote that the F.T.C. probably wouldn't win its challenge to the merger in the agency's internal court and said, essentially, that Microsoft was doing enough to prevent rivals from being hurt.
"The F.T.C. has not identified a single document which contradicts Microsoft's publicly stated commitment to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation," she wrote.
Eleanor Fox, a professor emeritus at New York University's law school, said it was too soon to have a verdict on Ms. Khan's strategy. Elsewhere in the world, especially in the European Union and in Britain, regulators have also pursued antitrust actions against large tech companies, she noted.
Ms. Khan, she said, "is only an outlier in the U.S., not globally."

Amazon Challenges
Digital Standards in E.U.
Amazon is disputing its status as a big online platform that needs to face stricter scrutiny under European Union digital rules taking effect next month, the first Silicon Valley tech giant to push back on the pioneering new standards.
The online retailer filed a legal challenge with a top European Union court, arguing it's being treated unfairly by being designated a "very large online platform" under the 27-nation bloc's sweeping Digital Services Act.
The Digital Services Act imposes new obligations on the biggest tech companies to keep users safe from illegal content and questionable products, with violations punishable by heavy fines or even a ban on operating in the E.U.
Seattle-based Amazon is one of 19 companies classed as the largest online platforms and search engines under the DSA, which means they will have to better police their services to protect European users from hate speech, disinformation and other harmful online content. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Daimler Truck Is Rosy
On Its Future Revenue
Daimler Truck expects revenues to grow as much as 60 percent between 2025 and 2030, top management of the truck and bus maker told investors on Tuesday.
The company's optimistic outlook, presented at a capital markets day in Boston, comes a year after Daimler Truck became an independently listed company in a spinoff from Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, and as it focuses on building autonomous trucks.
Daimler Truck shares rose 2.5 percent.
Easing supply chain constraints and stronger demand in its core markets and the after-sales business prompted the company late on Monday to raise its profit and revenue guidance for 2023.
"We are sold out for 2023," C.E.O. Martin Daum said on Tuesday. In Europe, the company is seeing strong orders for the first quarter of 2024, he said.
Mr. Daum said he would soon announce a partnership with a battery cell producer in the United States, in response to government incentives. REUTERS

O.E.C.D. Says A.I. Puts27 Percent of Jobs at Risk
More than a quarter of jobs in the 38-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development rely on skills that could be easily automated in the coming artificial intelligence revolution, and workers fear they could lose their jobs to A.I., the O.E.C.D. said on Tuesday.
There is little evidence the emergence of A.I. is having a significant impact on jobs so far, but that may be because the revolution is in its early stages, the O.E.C.D. said.
Jobs with the highest risk of being automated make up 27 percent of the labor force on average in O.E.C.D. countries, with eastern European countries most exposed, the organization said in its 2023 Employment Outlook.
Three out of five workers fear they could lose their job to A.I. over the next 10 years, the O.E.C.D. found in a survey last year before the explosive emergence of generative A.I. like ChatGPT. REUTERS

A Late Push Leads to Gains on Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/late-push-leads-gains-on-wall-st/docview/2835732763/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks climbed Tuesday as Wall Street prepared for an upcoming update on inflation that will hopefully show a smaller increase in pain for everyone.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent.
Activision Blizzard jumped 10 percent for one of the market's larger gains after a judge ruled Microsoft could move forward on its $ 69 billion takeover of the video game maker. Salesforce was the biggest force driving the Dow after climbing 3.9 percent on price increases announced for its products. Amazon also pushed the market upward and rose 1.3 percent on the first day of its annual Prime Day sales event.
Much of Wall Street's gains for the day came at the end of trading, with about a third of the S&P 500's rise happening in the final 20 minutes. The week's main event will arrive Wednesday, when the government will offer the latest update on inflation at the consumer level. Economists expect to see another slowdown, with prices 3.1 percent higher in June than a year earlier, down from inflation of 4 percent in May and just above 9 percent last summer.
The hope on Wall Street is that a continued easing in inflation will persuade the Federal Reserve to stop its interest rate increases soon. High rates have helped pull down inflation, but they've also caused cracks in the banking, manufacturing and other industries while also hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Later in the week, companies will begin telling investors how much profit they made during the spring, and expectations are largely dim. Analysts are forecasting the sharpest drop in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies since the pandemic was crushing the global economy in the spring of 2020.
This upcoming reporting season could mark the trough for corporate profit declines, according to strategists at Bank of America. They point to some resilient trends in the economy, as well as how many companies's forecasts for upcoming results are above analysts' expectations.
"We expect companies to sound more upbeat than in prior quarters," strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report. "Companies are likely to highlight bottoming process in business conditions and building momentum throughout the quarter and into July."
Because of the low bar set for companies for the spring, they may be able to squeak past without much heroics.
WD-40 jumped 18.5 percent after it said it returned to growth in revenue during the three months through May following two straight quarters of flat to down sales. It reported stronger growth in both profit and revenue than analysts expected, and said it would stick with its forecasts for full-year sales and profit.
On the losing side of Wall Street were several cruise operators, which lost momentum following a torrid start to the year. Carnival fell 2.1 percent, and Royal Caribbean slipped 1.9 percent. Both, though, are still up more than 100 percent for the year so far.
Bank of America drifted between losses and gains, ending with a gain of 1.3 percent after regulators said it double-dipped on fees, withheld rewards on credit cards and opened accounts without customers' knowledge.
In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed after rising last week on expectations the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer in its campaign to get inflation under control.
The 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 3.98 percent from 4.01 percent late Monday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, inched up 4.88 percent from 4.86 percent.
In markets abroad, most stock indexes rose. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1 percent, the Kospi in South Korea jumped 1.7 percent.

As Migration Rates Rise, Global Backlash Spreads: [briefing]

Author: Leonhardt, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Left-leaning parties in both Europe and the U.S. are often out of step with public opinion on immigration.
The global migration wave of the 21st century has little precedent. In much of North America, Europe and Oceania, the share of population that is foreign-born is at or near its highest level on record.
In the U.S., that share is approaching the previous high of 15 percent, reached in 1890. In some other countries, the immigration increases have been even steeper in the past two decades:
This scale of immigration tends to be unpopular with residents of the arrival countries. Illegal immigration is especially unpopular because it feeds a sense that a country's laws don't matter. But large amounts of legal immigration also bother many voters. Lower-income and blue-collar workers often worry that their wages will decline because employers suddenly have a larger, cheaper labor pool from which to hire.
As Tom Fairless, a Wall Street Journal reporter, wrote a few days ago:
Record immigration to affluent countries is sparking bigger backlashes across the world, boosting populist parties and putting pressure on governments to tighten policies to stem the migration wave. ...
The backlashes repeat a long cycle in immigration policy, experts say. Businesses constantly lobby for more liberal immigration laws because that reduces their labor costs and boosts profits. They draw support from pro-business politicians on the right and pro-integration leaders on the left, leading to immigration policies that are more liberal than the average voter wants.
Bernie vs. the left
The political left in both Europe and the U.S. has struggled to come up with a response to these developments. Instead, many progressives have dismissed immigration concerns as merely a reflection of bigotry that needs to be defeated. And opposition to immigration is frequently infused with racism: Right-wing leaders like Marine Le Pen in France traffic in hateful stereotypes about immigrants. Some, like Donald Trump, tell outright lies.
But favoring lower levels of immigration is not inherently bigoted or always right-wing. The most prosperous large countries in Africa, Asia and South America tend to have much smaller foreign-born shares of their population. Japan and South Korea make it particularly difficult for foreigners to enter.
In earlier eras, the political left in the U.S. included many figures who worried about the effects of large-scale immigration. Both labor leaders and civil-rights leaders, for example, argued for moderate levels of immigration to protect the interests of vulnerable workers.
"There is a reason why Wall Street and all of corporate America likes immigration reform, and it is not, in my view, that they're staying up nights worrying about undocumented workers in this country," Bernie Sanders said in 2015. "What I think they are interested in is seeing a process by which we can bring low-wage labor of all levels into this country to depress wages for Americans, and I strongly disagree with that."
Today, though, many progressives are uncomfortable with any immigration-skeptical argument. They have become passionate advocates of more migration and global integration, arguing -- correctly -- that immigrants usually benefit by moving from a lower-wage country to a higher-wage country. But immigration is not a free lunch any more than free trade is. It also has costs, including its burden on social services, as some local leaders, like Mayor Eric Adams of New York and officials in South Texas, have recently emphasized.
Rutte's decision
With today's left-leaning and centrist parties largely accepting of high levels of immigration, right-wing parties have become attractive to many voters who favor less immigration. The issue has fueled the rise of far-right nationalist parties in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland and elsewhere, as Jason Horowitz of The Times explained in a recent article. Jason focuses on Spain, another country where the anti-immigration party is growing.
The latest case study is the Netherlands. The governing coalition there collapsed on Friday after centrist parties refused to accept part of the conservative prime minister's plan to reduce migration. Rather than alter his plan, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, dissolved the government, setting up an election this fall.
Rutte, notably, is not a member of the far right. He is a mainstream Dutch conservative who has tried to marginalize the country's extremist anti-immigrant party. Yet he came to believe that reducing immigration was "a matter of political survival" for his party, my colleagues Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Claire Moses reported.
Although the details are different, President Biden has also recently taken steps to reduce unauthorized immigration. So far, his new policy -- which includes both more border enforcement and an expansion of legal pathways to apply for entry -- appears to have reduced the surge of migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Still, the issue clearly divides Biden's party. Many liberal Democrats have criticized his policy as heartless and said the U.S. should admit more migrants, not fewer.
Democrats frequently like to point out the many ways in which Republicans are out of step with public opinion, including on abortion bans, the minimum wage, taxes on the wealthy and background checks for gun owners. Immigration cuts the other way, polls show. It is a subject on which much of the Democratic Party, like the political left in Europe, is in a different place than many voters.

Judge Nixes F.T.C. Delay Of Purchase By Microsoft: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft also said it was negotiating changes to the deal to satisfy objections made by a British regulator, which could allow it to complete its purchase of the video game giant as soon as this month.
A federal judge on Tuesday ruled against the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to delay Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, setting the stage for the tech giant and the video game publisher to merge as soon as this month.
In a 53-page decision, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said the F.T.C. had failed to show it was likely to prove the merger would result in a substantial reduction in competition that would harm consumers.
She denied the F.T.C.'s request for a preliminary injunction, which would have delayed the deal's closing until after the agency could fight it in an internal court.
The ruling is a significant blow to the F.T.C.'s efforts to police blockbuster tech mergers more aggressively. That strategy is spearheaded by the agency's chair, Lina Khan, who has argued that Big Tech's vast influence over commerce and communications has led to anticompetitive behavior. The F.T.C. has sued Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, but it walked away from one of its cases against Meta and has had little to show for its efforts so far.
Microsoft and Activision cheered the ruling. "We're grateful to the Court in San Francisco for this quick and thorough decision," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote on Twitter. Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a statement that the merger would "enable competition rather than allow entrenched market leaders to continue to dominate."
Douglas Farrar, a spokesman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that the agency was "disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services and consoles." Mr. Farrar added that "in the coming days we'll be announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers."
The ruling lifts the temporary ban on closing the deal just before midnight on Friday, unless the F.T.C. obtains an extension from an appeals court.
There were also indications on Tuesday that the tide may be shifting in favor of Microsoft in Britain, which presented the other major hurdle to the acquisition. Regulators there had blocked the deal, saying it would stifle competition in streaming games online. But on Tuesday, Microsoft said it was pausing its formal appeal of that ruling to negotiate a settlement.
The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said in a statement that it was open to a proposal that would address its concerns, giving Microsoft significant momentum to complete its acquisition as soon as next week.
From the start, the F.T.C. appeared to be fighting an uphill battle against Microsoft, which said early last year that it would buy Activision in an effort to reshape its video game business and bring marquee games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft to its Xbox platform.
Courts have been concerned that mergers involving direct competitors will harm competition, but Microsoft and Activision are generally not considered direct competitors.
The F.T.C. sued Microsoft in its administrative court last year, but that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal from closing. In June, the F.T.C. asked Judge Corley to take that step, saying it feared Microsoft was on the verge of completing the transaction despite the government's concerns.
Over five days of testimony last month, the F.T.C. called high-profile witnesses like Mr. Kotick and Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, as it made the case that the merger would be bad for gamers and for competition.
The F.T.C. argued that Microsoft had significant incentives to make Activision's Call of Duty -- a franchise with more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- exclusive to the Xbox, withholding it from Sony's PlayStation or degrading PlayStation versions of the game.
But Microsoft said it had signed deals with companies like Nintendo to offer Call of Duty on other platforms, and had offered Sony a deal as well. Microsoft argued that it would have no incentive to risk angering gamers by reneging on its commitments to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and that it would lose out on a significant amount of revenue by cutting off PlayStation players.
Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
At times, Judge Corley seemed skeptical of the F.T.C.'s case. During closing arguments, she pressed the agency repeatedly to back up its claim that if Call of Duty was withheld from PlayStation, enough players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox to make the move worthwhile for Microsoft.
"The F.T.C. has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation, or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets," Judge Corley wrote in her decision.
"To the contrary," she added later, "the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content."
She wrote that despite "extensive discovery," including close to one million documents and 30 depositions, the F.T.C. "has not identified a single document which contradicts Microsoft's publicly stated commitment to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation (and Nintendo Switch)."
Her denial of a preliminary injunction means Microsoft could complete its merger with Activision as soon as this month in the United States. The companies set a July 18 deadline for the deal, with Microsoft required to pay Activision a $ 3 billion breakup fee if the deal does not go through by then. The companies could agree to delay that date, or they could merge while their appeal in Britain is pending.
It was the F.T.C.'s latest loss in a case involving one of the tech giants. While legal challenges under Ms. Khan caused companies like Lockheed Martin and the chip maker Nvidia to drop proposed acquisitions early in her tenure, the agency was unsuccessful this year in challenging Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up.
Ms. Khan has said she won't be deterred by courtroom losses. The chair and her allies believe that regulators were too risk-averse for years, leading to runaway corporate consolidation. They have said the F.T.C. and other government agencies must be willing to pursue novel cases even if they are not guaranteed wins.
In her ruling, Judge Corley argued that consumers benefited from Microsoft's expectation of a tough review, making agreements in writing and under oath to share Activision games with different consoles and streaming services. "That scrutiny has paid off," she wrote.

During a Strike, a Hollywood Diner Becomes a Different Kind of Writers' Room: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In their third month on the picket lines, Los Angeles screenwriters are drawing inspiration -- and sustenance -- from a local restaurant as their industry faces pressures from changing viewer habits.
They are usually fresh off the picket lines when they sink into plaid booths behind red Formica tables, or pull up to the terrazzo countertop, not far from the jukebox that switches from Sam Cooke to Joan Jett.
The room rumbles with their chatter, their laughter. Their emergency savings are dwindling, but hey, sitting together over free milkshakes and tuna melts, things don't feel so bad.
Such is the daily scene at Swingers, a beloved retro diner in Los Angeles where the lunch and dinner crowds are dominated by Hollywood writers still on strike.
For more than two months, they have fought studios for better wages and job security, and there is no hint of an agreement on the horizon. And yet, spirits are high.
"This is the time you would think things would be petering out, people would be getting tired," said Scott Saltzburg, a writer for the game show "Weakest Link" on NBC who tucked into a corner table on a recent weekday with a friend. "And I don't see that at all."
Since early May, 11,500 screenwriters have been on strike against Hollywood studios and entertainment companies in a battle for higher pay and better working conditions. Writers say their industry has increasingly become a gig economy, in which they are forced to string together income with side hustles. Those in the lowest-paid tier take on dog-sitting and delivery jobs to make ends meet.
Writers say they are frustrated at being slowly edged out of a changing industry. The Writers Guild of America has warned that the profession is at stake, as fewer episodes of each show are ordered, writers' rooms shrink and companies like Netflix and Amazon limit their residual payments. The writers also want restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence.
For their part, major-studio executives are facing a business model in crisis, as viewing habits and advertisers shift away from broadcast and cable networks. Streaming services have continued to lose money, and executives say there is little room in the situation for raises.
"In some ways, the W.G.A. has caught management at an awkward moment," said Jonathan Kuntz, a retired film historian who taught at the School of Theater, Film and Television at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It's not a time when they're feeling rich and fat and sassy and might be willing to share. Instead, there's great upheaval, and we've seen layoffs and cutbacks."
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios' interests, points to the high salaries that writers can already reach and says that companies have offered outsized wage and residual increases. The alliance has resisted the union's proposal for a minimum number of writers on staff for shows, saying that would be a hiring quota that does not align with the creative process.
Most productions in Los Angeles have been disrupted by picketing writers. Other trades that serve the industry -- the caterers, costumers, prop houses -- are sympathetic, but hurting.
"It's been really tough -- it's so slow, and there's nothing going on," said Dan Schultz, vice president of Prop Heaven in Burbank. "We're an ancillary business, and things roll downhill. We're at the bottom of that hill."
Mr. Schultz said the prop house had lost at least 80 percent of its business because of the strike. Requests for props for live events or commercials have helped, but there is no pivot that can make up for regular production work. For now, the company's 28 employees focus on in-house projects like cleaning up and organizing areas of the showroom.
At Western Costume, which has outfitted actors in films for more than a century, the 120,000-square-foot warehouse full of rentals has had little traffic lately.
"When we're busy, it's like a train station -- there's a constant flow of customers coming in and out," said Gilbert Moussally, vice president of costume operations. "There's almost zero at this point."
During the 2007 writers' strike, the California economy lost $ 2.1 billion, according to one estimate. The hardship could intensify if the actors also go on strike after their contract with the studios expires Wednesday night.
The current writers' strike is expected to last longer than the 100-day walkout in 2007. Many writers said that guild members seem particularly determined, and that morale is much higher this time around. At picket lines across the city, there are theme days (think cosplay or Beyoncé), television-show reunions, karaoke Fridays. Guild members are drawing support from social media, and strike captains have been flooded with donations of beverages, snacks, sunscreen and food trucks.
And there are free burgers and fries at Swingers, an institution that has always drawn industry regulars.
Drew Carey -- the actor, comedian and game-show host -- is currently paying back the restaurant for each meal, plus tip, that is ordered by someone who flashes a Writers Guild membership card. Mr. Carey made the same grand gesture during the previous strike, one that he also extends at Bob's Big Boy in Burbank.
Each week, his tab at Swingers runs more than $ 10,000. Without it, "I'm sure we would be completely hurting, and we were, the first few weeks," said its owner, Stephanie Wilson.
The restaurant has its own Hollywood story arc: Iconic hangout where employees who are like family closes during the pandemic. Actress/waitress turned manager and mother of three scrapes together funds from relatives and friends to buy and revive the place.
Ms. Wilson, 41, now oversees a main hub of the strike. "Writers are, I think, kind of the backbone of it all," she said.
By early evening on a Monday night, the diner's servers had changed shifts, but the clatter of plates and glasses had not paused. The sun's last rays lingered on tables where customers squinted at the light.
Sitting across from her husband and collaborator, Anya Meksin attempted to finish her chopped salad while keeping their 2-year-old son from climbing over the top of the booth. The family has been coming to the diner at least twice a week, trying to stretch the savings they are relying on.
Just before the strike, Ms. Meksin, 41, was hired for "High Potential," a new detective series on ABC. But the work won't start until after the union has a contract.
The free dinners and the chance to be around people in similar situations has become her comfort zone.
"It feels," she said, "like a union mess hall."

Full text: This month's picks include a sweet dragon tale, the new "Avatar" installment and an updated Cinderella story.
'My Father's Dragon'
Stream it on Netflix.
"My Father's Dragon," an adaptation of the 1948 children's novel of the same name by Ruth Stiles Gannett, follows a young boy named Elmer (Jacob Tremblay, recently the voice of Flounder in "The Little Mermaid") who is living a blissful life with his mother, Dela (Golshifteh Farahani). When Dela's business shuts down, it forces her to move to a city tenement and scramble for work. A black cat (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) tells Elmer to journey to a place called Wild Island and free a dragon named Boris, who can, in turn, bring fame and fortune to Dela. Elmer finds Boris (Gaten Matarazzo of "Stranger Things") and what ensues is a tender story of friendship, fear and bravery. Beautiful hand-drawn animation and wide-eyed characters are a signature of Cartoon Saloon, the Oscar-nominated Irish animation studio that produced this film along with Netflix and Mockingbird Pictures. And thanks to the director Nora Twomey ("The Breadwinner") and the screenwriter Meg LeFauve ("Inside Out"), both Oscar nominees, this 2022 film's sweet, important lessons -- that it's OK to be scared sometimes and that bonds between friends give us courage -- are made digestible for young children.
'Cinderella'
Stream it on Amazon Prime.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Freeing fairy tales of their outdated I-just-want-to-feel-pretty heroines is par for the course these days, and this 2021 entry into the pantheon, co-produced by James Corden, stars the pop princess Camila Cabello as the titular heroine. Coming on the glass heels of modern-day Cinderellas like Brandy, Drew Barrymore and Anne Hathaway, Cabello's princess-to-be is a woman on a mission -- and that mission does not involve marriage and homemaking. Her goal in life is to make it as a fashion designer, but her evil stepmother (Idina Menzel) doesn't want her at balls where she could show off her designs. Even so, Cinderella will not be deterred. You can likely guess the rest of the plot from there (Cinderella and the Prince meet; she resists his love because she is a MODERN WOMAN; musical numbers abound). Not everyone loves this version, and its writer-director, Kay Cannon ("Pitch Perfect"), made some dialogue choices that might feel too juvenile for older kids and adults ("I have dreams that I have to chase!"). Still, the tunes and proven, although updated, story line should entertain youngsters who love a good not-your-average-princess story. Billy Porter, in all his splendor, plays the Fabulous Godmother.
'World's Best'
Stream it on Disney+.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
New Jersey tween Prem (Manny Magnus) is following in the footsteps of his widowed mother, Priya (Punam Patel from "Special"), by training for a Mathlympics competition. Prem's father, Suresh (Utkarsh Ambudkar, who co-wrote the screenplay), died of cancer when Prem was in elementary school, which Priya still struggles to discuss. That is, until she tells her son that his father was actually a hip-hop legend. This juicy and unexpected family secret inspires Prem to ditch calculus for freestyle rapping. Prem's real-life middle school existence is interrupted by a series of fantasy sequences in which he and his father rap onstage, transforming this dramedy into a raucous hip-hop musical that might fall flat if you're expecting A Tribe Called Quest-level skills. The lyrics are amateur, which makes sense since Prem is jumping from math prodigy to rap novice. His best friend, Jerome (Max Malas), provides some laughs, and his Mathlympics rival Claire (Piper Wallace) provides some light middle school villainy. It's a high-energy romp from the director Roshan Sethi ("7 Days") that should appeal to music-loving school-age kids who love to see the underdog take the stage.
'Avatar: Way of Water'
Stream it on Disney+ and Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Years after the events of the first "Avatar" movie, we pick up with the human Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), who is now a Na'vi (you know, the blue creatures) and husband to Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña). They're raising a bevy of children, three of their own along with the human orphan nicknamed Spider and Kiri, the daughter of Sigourney Weaver's character, Dr. Grace Augustine, from the first film. The family's idyllic life in the fictional realm of Pandora is disrupted when "sky people" (you know, the military) come back to avenge Jake for betraying his human self. He is torn between fighting the enemy and protecting his family, and the universe of the original film opens up as they travel to distant, extremely gorgeous landscapes. With a running time of just over three hours, this James Cameron film might not be in the cards for toddlers who can watch maybe 20 minutes of "Blippi" before imploding. For older kids with some viewing stamina, the dynamic flying scenes and eye-popping visuals should hold their attention. Maybe not for the whole time, but you can always hit pause and come back later.
'A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This Halloween-night comedy is not quite "Adventures in Babysitting" meets "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," but it tries. It's based on the popular book series of the same name by Joe Ballarini about a secret society of babysitters who protect the children they watch from monsters. Here, a timid, math-loving teen named Kelly (Tamara Smart from "The Worst Witch") is taking care of little Jacob (Ian Ho), who can't sleep because, like many kids, he's afraid of the dark. Kelly harbors her own childhood memories of being terrorized by scary ghouls and goblins, which has caused her to lead a cautious teenage life, devoid of fun. When the evil Grand Guignol (Tom Felton) tells his army of colorful C.G.I. monsters to kidnap Jacob, Kelly discovers that her young charge is missing and, in true teen fashion, she freaks. She's helped along when the cyberpunk-ish teen Liz LeRue (Oona Laurence) pops by and tells her about a magical order of babysitters she belongs to who can help Kelly find Jacob. It's not exactly scary, but for witch- and monster-loving kids, it might be a fun way to escape the summer heat.

Full text: "Farming," a choral work that had its New York premiere at Caramoor, is a chaotically ambitious reflection on colonization, consumption and marketing.
Google search results broke my heart this weekend.
Which was strange, because they didn't include anything overtly emotional. They were lines like: "Yes, we are open. Call our consultants today." And: "Reliable, seasonal work force." The kind of thing you get when you look up "H-2A visa program," which grants temporary admission to the United States for agricultural workers.
But set to soulful, almost retro, doo-wop-honeyed music by Ted Hearne in "Farming," these bland fragments seemed to touch the very core of our country: its rapacious economy, its broken immigration system, its corroded politics.
Performed at Caramoor in Westchester on Sunday by the 24 vocalists of the Crossing, the precise and luminous new-music choir led by Donald Nally, it was the sweetest, saddest song.
A suggestive, chaotically ambitious, often poignant reflection on colonization, consumption, marketing, entrepreneurship -- you name it! -- "Farming" reaches well beyond that Google search. Its quilt-like libretto encompasses 17th-century letters by William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, and 21st-century musings by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as absurdist out-of-context bits from UberEats's Twitter feed and the Farmer's Fridge customer loyalty program. ("Green are the Farmer's Fridge reward currency," the singers intone with maniacal severity.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As he has in superb works like "The Source" (based on the Afghanistan war logs leaked by Chelsea Manning) and "Sound From the Bench" (which set excerpts from Supreme Court proceedings), Hearne takes these found-text nuggets and gives them music that moves from lushly meditative to frenetic and obsessively repetitive -- a visceral translation into sound of the information overload that is contemporary life.
The singing is sometimes pure and sometimes processed into exaggeratedly AutoTuned "Alvin and the Chipmunks" automation. On guitars, keyboards, percussion and electronics, the six instrumentalists also veer from moody industrial rock and elegiac synth drones to jittery, hypersaccharine pop. (Occasionally resting, as in "Search," that Google section, somewhere in between.)
Not quite an hour long, the nine-part "Farming" is Hearne's latest collaboration with the Philadelphia-based Crossing, which premiered it a few weeks ago in Bucks County, Pa., and already toured it to the Netherlands before this performance at Caramoor, its first in New York. The threat of rain on Sunday forced a move inside and an adaptation of the staging and complex sound design.
Given the circumstances, the production and the sound were impressively polished. A QR code included with the program linked listeners' phones to the libretto; accessing it also involved signing onto Caramoor's Wi-Fi, and it seemed that many in the audience weren't doing it.
Without following the words, it would be nearly impossible to have any idea what was going on in this non-narrative but intensely text-focused work. I'm no fan of wasting paper, but this was an appropriate occasion to print out the libretto for everyone -- and future iterations might want to experiment with supertitles.
And Ashley Tata's perkily surreal corporate-parody staging, which put the performers in bright orange, magenta and white uniform-type costumes, felt like a complexity too many in a piece already full of them. The attempt to tie together the work's many thematic strands by enacting onstage what Hearne's program note called "a new corporation, powered by quasi-religious fervor," was confusing -- though maybe things were clearer in the original, outdoor conception.
While this piece is less scattered than Hearne's most recent major work, "Place," a deeply personal reflection on gentrification, "Farming," too, feels like a grab bag into which there's always assumed to be room for yet one more idea. The central pairing of Penn and Bezos, the two pioneers -- their vast differences, their essential similarities -- would probably have been a more than sufficient subject here.
The Penn quotations conjure some of the fundamental, irreconcilable tension of our country's founding: his efforts to maintain good relations with the Indigenous population, on the one hand, and the commercial interests he wanted to expand, on the other.
To what extent are Bezos's manipulative doublespeak and high-minded invocations of empowerment through selling a break with Penn's colonial promises? To what degree are they merely a continuation of what were sour lies to begin with?
These are the kind of huge, unanswerable questions that Hearne's works have presented so enigmatically yet powerfully over the past decade, fired by his passionate, resourceful music. I found other parts here -- the Farmer's Fridge, the Twitter fragments, the staging -- a distraction from that burning central point.
Yet I would have hated to lose "Search." And Hearne's earnest too-muchness, his eagerness to stuff as much as possible into each piece, has become such a central feature of his artistry that it's hard to think of it as a weakness. It's who he is.

As Businesses Quickly Find Uses for A.I., Tech Companies Rush to Offer Products: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Amazon, Box, Salesforce, Oracle and others have recently rolled out A.I.-related products to help workplaces become more efficient and productive.
Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company's developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.
It seemed to be a game-changer, Mr. Austin said. But since ChatGPT is a publicly available tool, he wondered if it was secure for businesses to use.
So in January, AT&T tried a product from Microsoft called Azure OpenAI Services that lets businesses build their own A.I.-powered chatbots. AT&T used it to create a proprietary A.I. assistant, Ask AT&T, which helps its developers automate their coding process. AT&T's customer service representatives also began using the chatbot to help summarize their calls, among other tasks.
"Once they realize what it can do, they love it," Mr. Austin said. Forms that once took hours to complete needed only two minutes with Ask AT&T so employees could focus on more complicated tasks, he said, and developers who used the chatbot increased their productivity by 20 to 50 percent.
AT&T is one of many businesses eager to find ways to tap the power of generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots and that has gripped Silicon Valley with excitement in recent months. Generative A.I. can produce its own text, photos and video in response to prompts, capabilities that can help automate tasks such as taking meeting minutes and cut down on paperwork.
To meet this new demand, tech companies are racing to introduce products for businesses that incorporate generative A.I. Over the past three months, Amazon, Box and Cisco have unveiled plans for generative A.I.-powered products that produce code, analyze documents and summarize meetings. Salesforce also recently rolled out generative A.I. products used in sales, marketing and its Slack messaging service, while Oracle announced a new A.I. feature for human resources teams.
These companies are also investing more in A.I. development. In May, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures, the venture capital arm of Salesforce, invested in Cohere, a Toronto start-up focused on generative A.I. for business use. Oracle is also reselling Cohere's technology.
"I think this is a complete breakthrough in enterprise software," Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, said of generative A.I. He called it "this incredibly exciting opportunity where, for the first time ever, you can actually start to understand what's inside of your data in a way that wasn't possible before."
Many of these tech companies are following Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. In January, Microsoft made Azure OpenAI Service available to customers, who can then access OpenAI's technology to build their own versions of ChatGPT. As of May, the service had 4,500 customers, said John Montgomery, a Microsoft corporate vice president.
For the most part, tech companies are now rolling out four kinds of generative A.I. products for businesses: features and services that generate code for software engineers, create new content such as sales emails and product descriptions for marketing teams, search company data to answer employee questions, and summarize meeting notes and lengthy documents.
"It is going to be a tool that is used by people to accomplish what they are already doing," said Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at the I.T. research and consulting firm Gartner.
But using generative A.I. in workplaces has risks. Chatbots can produce inaccuracies and misinformation, provide inappropriate responses and leak data. A.I. remains largely unregulated.
In response to these issues, tech companies have taken some steps. To prevent data leakage and to enhance security, some have engineered generative A.I. products so they do not keep a customer's data.
When Salesforce last month introduced AI Cloud, a service with nine generative A.I.-powered products for businesses, the company included a "trust layer" to help mask sensitive corporate information to stop leaks and promised that what users typed into these products would not be used to retrain the underlying A.I. model.
Similarly, Oracle said that customer data would be kept in a secure environment while training its A.I. model and added that it would not be able to see the information.
Salesforce offers AI Cloud starting at $ 360,000 annually, with the cost rising depending on the amount of usage. Microsoft charges for Azure OpenAI Service based on the version of OpenAI technology that a customer chooses, as well as the amount of usage.
For now, generative A.I. is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks -- instead of highly regulated industries -- with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte A.I. Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that over half the respondents have no internal policy on generative A.I.
"It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your work force for the new kinds of work that might evolve," Ms. Ammanath said. "There is going to be new skills needed."
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments -- such as legal, accounting and quality assurance -- also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect's marketing and communications chief.
"Everyone started using it in ways that we didn't even foresee ourselves," he said. "So people are really taking advantage of it."

Who Truly Threatens the Church?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There's a popular story in Christian circles that's literally too good to be true. According to legend, in the early 1900s, The Times of London sent an inquiry to a number of writers asking the question, "What's wrong with the world today?" The Christian apologist G.K. Chesterton responded succinctly and profoundly: "Dear Sirs, I am."
The real story is just as profound, but less succinct. In 1905 Chesterton wrote a much longer letter to London's Daily News, and that letter included these sentences: "In one sense, and that the eternal sense, the thing is plain. The answer to the question 'What is Wrong?' is, or should be, 'I am wrong.' Until a man can give that answer his idealism is only a hobby."
I've thought about that Chesterton quote often during the age of Trump, especially as I've seen the "new" Christian right re-embrace the authoritarianism of previous American political eras. At the exact time when religious liberty is enjoying a historic winning streak at the Supreme Court, a cohort of Christians has increasingly decided that liberty isn't enough. To restore the culture and protect our children, it's necessary to exercise power to shape our national environment.
And so the conservative movement is changing. When I was a younger lawyer, conservatives fought speech codes that often inhibited religious and conservative discourse on campus. Now, red state legislatures are writing their own speech codes, hoping to limit discussion of the ideas they disfavor. When I was starting my career, my conservative colleagues and I rolled our eyes at the right-wing book purges of old, when angry parents tried to yank "dangerous" books off school library shelves. Well, now the purges are back, as parents are squaring off in school districts across the nation, arguing over the words children should be allowed to read.
Years ago, I laughed at claims that Christian conservatives were dominionists in disguise, that we didn't just want religious freedom, we wanted religious authority. Yet now, such claims are hardly laughable. Arguments for a "Christian nationalism" are increasingly prominent, with factions ranging from Catholic integralists to reformed Protestants to prophetic Pentecostals all seeking a new American social compact, one that explicitly puts Christians in charge.
The motivating force behind this transformation is a powerful sense of threat -- the idea that the left is "coming after" you and your family. This mind-set sees the Christian use of power as inherently protective, and the desire to censor as an attempt to save children from dangerous ideas. The threat to the goodness of the church and the virtue of its members, in other words, comes primarily from outside its walls, from a culture and a world that is seen as worse in virtually every way.
But there's a contrary view, one that emanates from the idea of original sin, which Chesterton argued was "the only part of Christian theology which can really be proved." The doctrine of original sin rejects the idea that we are intrinsically good and are corrupted only by the outside world. Instead, we enter life with our own profound and inherent flaws. We are all, in a word, fallen. To quote Jesus in the book of Mark, "There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him." All manner of sin and evil comes "from within, out of the heart of man."
Under this understanding of Scripture, we are all our own greatest enemy -- Christians as fully as those who do not share our beliefs. We do not, either as individuals or as a religious movement, possess an inherent virtue that should entitle any of us to rule. We shun the will to power because we rightly fear our own sin, and we protect the liberty of others because we do not possess all wisdom and we need to hear their ideas.
Of course that is not to say that external voices and ideas can have no negative effect in our lives. We might be our own greatest enemy, but we're not our only enemy. But if we are deeply flawed, then that realization has to profoundly impact how we approach politics. It has to temper our confidence that we either can control or should control the public square.
One of the best recent books about the American founding is "We the Fallen People: The Founders and American Democracy" by the Wheaton College professor Robert Tracy McKenzie. In it, he details at length the founders' own reservations about human nature. As James Madison famously wrote in Federalist No. 51: "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary."
This proper skepticism about human virtue pervades the Constitution. At every turn, the power of government is hemmed in. Each branch checks the other. The people check the government, and the government checks the people. The Bill of Rights attempts to safeguard our most fundamental human rights from government overreach or the tyranny of the mob. No faction can be trusted with unchecked authority.
But, as Professor McKenzie argues, this understanding faced an early and serious challenge in a political movement that we'd recognize today -- Jacksonian populism, the idea that "the people" were, in fact, righteous enough to rule. You see echoes today in the constant refrain from the Trumpist right that "we the people" represent the "real America," the virtuous core that can save the nation from what they see as a decadent left.
The very concept was, and is, destructive to its core. The sense of virtue creates a sense of righteous entitlement. In Christian America, the belief that "we" are good leads to the conviction that the churches will suffer, our nation will suffer and our families will suffer unless "we" run things. It closes our hearts and minds to contrary voices and opposing ideas.
Putting aside for the moment the long history of religious misrule, recent events demonstrate the reach of Christian sin. In 2021 our nation suffered when many Christian activists, Christian members of Congress and Christian Trump aides participated in an attempt to overturn an American election and helped instigate a violent assault on the Capitol.
But one doesn't have to look to national politics to see that threats can emanate from within the church as well as without. One of the most terrifying and poignant parts of the hit Amazon Prime documentary series "Shiny Happy People" was the story of Josh Duggar, a young man who was raised in a deeply religious family. He was protected from the corruption of the "outside world" in almost every way that could be devised. He was home-schooled and grew up in a house without a cable television and with limited access to media. And yet he was depraved enough to molest his own sisters.
My wife and I both grew up in a fundamentalist community that tried hard to protect the church from the world. Yet it turned out that my wife needed protection from the church. She's a victim of child sex abuse. The perpetrator taught vacation Bible school.
This recent legacy of scandal and abuse should be more than enough evidence of the need for existential humility in any Christian political theology. This is not moral relativism. We still possess core convictions. But existential humility acknowledges the limits of our own wisdom and virtue. Existential humility renders liberty a necessity, not merely to safeguard our own beliefs but also to safeguard our access to other ideas and arguments that might help expose our own mistakes and shortcomings.
Who is wrong? I am wrong. We are wrong. Until the church can give that answer, its political idealism will meet a tragic and destructive end. The attempt to control others will not preserve our virtue, and it risks inflicting our own failures on the nation we seek to save.

In Age of A.I., Tech's Little Guys Need Big Friends: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The tech industry loves its garage start-up stories. From Hewlett-Packard to Google, the tales of bootstrapped companies that have turned into giants have inspired generations of entrepreneurs.
But the huge amounts of money and computing power needed for start-ups trying to make a go of it with today's hottest technology, the artificial intelligence used in chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard, may be making those inspirational tales a thing of the past.
In 2019, Aidan Gomez and Nick Frosst left Google to create an A.I. start-up in Toronto called Cohere that could compete with their former employer. Several months later, they went back to Google and asked if it would sell them the enormous computing power they would need to build their own A.I. technology. After Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, personally approved the arrangement, the tech giant gave them what they wanted.
"It's 'Game of Thrones.' That's what it is," said David Katz, a partner with Radical Ventures, Cohere's first investor. The big companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon, he added, are controlling the chips. "They're controlling the computing power," he said. "They are selecting who gets it."
Building a groundbreaking A.I. start-up is difficult without getting the support of "the hyperscalers," which control the vast data centers capable of running A.I. systems. And that has put the industry's giants in the driver's seat -- again -- for what many expect to be the most important shift for the tech industry in decades.
OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT, recently raised $ 10 billion from Microsoft. It will pump most of that money back into Microsoft as it pays for time on the massive clusters of computer servers operated by the bigger company. Spanning thousands of specialized computer chips, these machines are essential to improving and expanding the skills of ChatGPT and similar technologies.
Competitors cannot keep pace with OpenAI unless they get their hands on similar amounts of computing power. Cohere recently raised $ 270 million, bringing its total funding to more than $ 440 million. It will use much of that money to buy computing power from the likes of Google.
Other start-ups have made similar arrangements, most notably a Silicon Valley company called Anthropic, which was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers; Character.AI, founded by two leading researchers from Google; and Inflection AI, founded by a former Google executive. Inflection raised a $ 1.3 billion funding round last week, bringing its total to $ 1.5 billion.
At Google, Mr. Gomez was part of a small research team that designed the Transformer, the fundamental technology used to create chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard.
The Transformer is a powerful example of what scientists call a neural network -- a mathematical system that can learn skills by analyzing data. Neural networks have been around for years, helping to drive everything from talking digital assistants like Siri to instant translation services like Google Translate.
The Transformer took the idea into new territory. Running across hundreds or even thousands of computer chips, it could analyze far more data, far more quickly.
Using this technology, companies like Google and OpenAI began building systems that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including Wikipedia articles, digital books and chat logs. As these systems analyzed more and more data, they learned to generate text on their own, including term papers, blog posts, poetry and computer code.
These systems -- called large language models -- now underpin chatbots like Google Bard and ChatGPT.
Well before the arrival of ChatGPT, Mr. Gomez left Google to start his own company alongside Mr. Frosst and another Toronto entrepreneur, Ivan Zhang. The aim was to build large language models rivaling Google's.
At Google, he and his fellow researchers had access to nearly unlimited amounts of computing power. After leaving the company, he needed something similar. So he and his co-founders purchased it from Google, which sells access to the same chips through cloud computing services.
Over the next three years, Cohere built a large language model that rivals almost any other. Now, it is selling this technology to other businesses. The idea is to provide any company with the technology they need to build and run their own A.I. applications, from chatbots to search engines to personal tutors.
"The strategy is to build a platform that others can build off of and experiment with," Mr. Gomez said.
OpenAI offers a service along the same lines called GPT-4, which many businesses are already using to build chatbots and other applications. This new technology can analyze, generate and edit text. But it will soon handle images and sounds as well. OpenAI is preparing a version of GPT-4 that can examine a photograph, instantly describe it and even answer questions about it.
Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, said the company's arrangement with OpenAI is the kind of mutually beneficial relationship that it has long nurtured with smaller competitors. "I grew up in a company that has always done these types of deals with other companies," he told The New York Times earlier this year.
As the industry races to match GPT-4, entrepreneurs, investors and pundits are debating who will be the eventual winners. Most agree that OpenAI is leading the field. But Cohere and a small group of other companies are building similar technology.
The tech giants are in a strong position because they have the vast resources needed to push these systems further than anyone else. Google also holds a patent on the Transformer, the foundational technology behind the A.I. systems that Cohere and many other companies are building.
But there is a wild card: Open source software.
Meta, another giant with the computing power needed to build the next wave of A.I., recently open sourced its latest large language model, meaning anyone can reuse it and build on top of it. Many in the field believe this kind of freely available software will allow anyone to compete.
"Having the collective minds of every researchers on Earth would beat any company," said Amr Awadallah, chief executive of the A.I. start-up Vectara and a former Google executive. But they'll still need to pay for access to a much larger competitor's data centers.

Trump Asked About an I.R.S. Inquiry of F.B.I. Officials: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a court filing, John Kelly, who was a chief of staff under Donald Trump, said the former president had asked about having the tax agency look into Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
John F. Kelly, who served as former President Donald J. Trump's second White House chief of staff, said in a sworn statement that Mr. Trump had discussed having the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies investigate two F.B.I. officials involved in the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
Mr. Kelly said that his recollection of Mr. Trump's comments to him was based on notes that he had taken at the time in 2018. Mr. Kelly provided copies of his notes to lawyers for one of the F.B.I. officials, who made the sworn statement public in a court filing.
"President Trump questioned whether investigations by the Internal Revenue Service or other federal agencies should be undertaken into Mr. Strzok and/or Ms. Page," Mr. Kelly said in the statement. "I do not know of President Trump ordering such an investigation. It appeared, however, that he wanted to see Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page investigated."
Mr. Kelly's assertions were disclosed on Thursday in a statement that was filed in connection with lawsuits brought by Peter Strzok, who was the lead agent in the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation, and Lisa Page, a former lawyer in the bureau, against the Justice Department for violating their privacy rights when the Trump administration made public text messages between them.
The disclosures from Mr. Kelly, made under penalty of perjury, demonstrate the extent of Mr. Trump's interest in harnessing the law enforcement and investigative powers of the federal government to target his perceived enemies. In the aftermath of Richard M. Nixon's presidency, Congress made it illegal for a president to "directly or indirectly" order an I.R.S. investigation or audit.
The New York Times reported last July that two of Mr. Trump's greatest perceived enemies -- James B. Comey, whom he fired as F.B.I. director, and Mr. Comey's deputy, Andrew G. McCabe -- were the subject of the same type of highly unusual and invasive I.R.S. audit.
It is not known whether the I.R.S. investigated Mr. Strzok or Ms. Page. But Mr. Strzok became a subject in the investigation conducted by the special counsel John Durham into how the F.B.I. investigated Mr. Trump's campaign. Neither Mr. Strzok nor Ms. Page was charged in connection with that investigation, which former law enforcement officials and Democrats have criticized as an effort to carry out Mr. Trump's vendetta against the bureau. Mr. Strzok is also suing the department for wrongful termination.
Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page exchanged text messages that were critical of Mr. Trump and were later made public by Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general under Mr. Trump, as he faced heavy criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill who were trying to find ways to undermine him.
The sworn statements from Mr. Kelly are similar to ones he made to The New York Times in November, in which he said that Mr. Trump had told him that he wanted a number of his perceived political enemies to be investigated by the I.R.S., including Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page.
Mr. Kelly told The Times last year that Mr. Trump's demands were part of a broader pattern of attempts to use the Justice Department and his authority as president against people who had been critical of him, including seeking to revoke the security clearances of former top intelligence officials.
In the sworn statement, Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had discussed having the security clearances of Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page revoked, although Mr. Kelly did not take action on the idea. Mr. Kelly said that his notes showed that Mr. Trump discussed the investigations of the two on Feb. 21, 2018.
"I did not make a note of every instance in which then President Trump made a comment about Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page," Mr. Kelly said. "President Trump generally disapproved of note-taking in meetings. He expressed concern that the notes might later be used against him."
Mr. Kelly said that he never took any steps to follow through on Mr. Trump's desires to have his enemies investigated.
Mr. Trump has said he knew nothing about the audits of Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe and their spouses. The I.R.S.'s inspector general found last year that Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe had been randomly selected for the audits, though the inspector general's report acknowledged some deviations from the I.R.S.'s rigorous rules for random selection when the agency made final selections of the returns that would be audited.
Mr. Kelly told The Times last year that Mr. Trump had at times discussed using the I.R.S. and the Justice Department to address others in addition to Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page.
They included, Mr. Kelly said, the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan; Hillary Clinton; and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post, whose coverage often angered Mr. Trump.

Full text: "Insecure" has made its way to Netflix. Otherwise, check out an Agatha Christie mystery adapted and directed by Hugh Laurie.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I missed the boat.
'Insecure'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix or Max.
All five seasons of this HBO comedy are now available on Netflix -- the first of several high-profile series to cross what was once an unbridgeable divide between rival platforms. ("Band of Brothers" and "Six Feet Under," among others, will be on Netflix soon, too.) Issa Rae, a creator of the show, stars as a woman struggling to launch the next chapter of her life, the more settled and adult chapter, the one where she's supposed to know what she's doing with her career and her BFFs and her love life. "Insecure" makes for a terrific binge, especially if you like high-friction friendships.
... three hours, and I like Agatha Christie.
'Why Didn't They Ask Evans?'
When to watch: Now, on BritBox; Episode 1 is also available on Amazon.
Hugh Laurie adapted and directed this three-part mystery set mostly in Wales. Bobby (Will Poulter) is playing a seaside round of golf when he stumbles upon a dying man whose last words are "Why didn't they ask Evans?" Why indeed! This sets Bobby and his childhood pal, Frankie (Lucy Boynton), off on a romance-inducing investigation, full of patter and famous faces. "Evans" has a bouncy charm to it, a sense of humor and mischief that more intense murder shows tend to avoid. If you like the costumes on "All Creatures Great and Small," watch this.
... six hours, and I want a quirky comedy.
'Laid'
When to watch: Now, on Freevee, the Roku Channel or Tubi.
There are only two six-episode seasons of this naughty, darling Australian comedy that originally ran from 2011-12, so pace yourself accordingly. Roo (Alison Bell) is chugging along at a crummy job and hanging out with her supportive bestie when suddenly her ex-boyfriends start dying, one by one. At first it seems like a tragic set of coincidences, but Roo becomes convinced there's something more specific, perhaps supernatural, afoot. While the setup for the show is dark, "Laid" is actually peppy and silly, much more "The Good Place" than "The Leftovers." If you like lovable dirtbag characters, kick off those crusty flip-flops and watch this.

E.U. Court Rejects Meta's Appeal on How It Harvests Users' Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Satariano, Adam

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
Meta's ability to harvest data about users in order to sell personalized ads was thrown into question on Tuesday after the European Union's highest court upheld a decision by German antitrust regulators that the company had abused its dominance in social media.
The ruling in the closely watched case by the European Court of Justice cleared the way for Germany's top antitrust enforcer, the Bundeskartellamt, to block Meta from combining data collected about users across its different platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as from outside websites and apps, unless it gets explicit permission from users.
The decision undercuts Meta's business model, which relies on selling targeted advertising based on the massive amounts of data it gathers about its users as they use Meta services and browse the wider internet.
Why It Matters: Emboldening tougher oversight of Big Tech
The decision provides fresh momentum for supporters of tougher regulation of the world's largest technology companies. Although the ruling applies only to Meta services in Germany, it is expected to influence other antitrust authorities in the European Union.
A new E.U. antitrust law, called the Digital Markets Act, takes effect in the coming months and gives regulators new powers to encourage competition in the tech sector.
In particular, Tuesday's court ruling gives authorities in the European Union a firmer legal basis to examine how data-collection practices could undercut competition, which is a new direction for antitrust enforcement.
The court said regulators investigating antitrust cases can also examine whether a company is breaking the European Union's data protection law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R.
Background: A new spin on antitrust law
In 2019, German regulators used a novel interpretation of antitrust law to determine that Meta's data-gathering practices were a violation of not just competition rules, but also the G.D.P.R. The authorities said Meta needed to get permission from users and could not just collect endless amounts of data simply because a user had signed up to use one of the company's services.
Andreas Mundt, Germany's top antitrust regulator, said Meta's policies amounted to a false choice, forcing people to either use Meta services and share their data, or stay off the company's ubiquitous social media sites altogether.
After the company appealed the decision, it eventually landed before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Mr. Mundt has long pushed for regulators to be tougher against Facebook and other tech giants. He has argued that Facebook uses the data it collects from users to strengthen its position over rivals, harming competition.
What's Next
In a statement, Meta said it was "evaluating the Court's decision and will have more to say in due course."
The company will now have to make changes in Germany to comply with the ruling. That is likely to include a new menu that gives users more choice about how their data is collected.
But the decision also has implications for other online platforms that collect large amounts of data for digital advertising, including Amazon, Google and TikTok.
"When large internet companies use the very personal data of consumers, this usage can also be deemed abusive under competition law," Mr. Mundt, the German antitrust regulator, said in a statement on Tuesday. "The judgment will have far-reaching effects on the business models used in the data economy."
Andreas Mundt, Germany's top antitrust regulator, championed a theory that weighs the accumulation of data as a form of anticompetitive behavior. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JANN HÖFER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B5.

Full text: For thousands of years, mathematicians have adapted to the latest advances in logic and reasoning. Are they ready for artificial intelligence?
In the collection of the Getty museum in Los Angeles is a portrait from the 17th century of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid: disheveled, holding up sheets of "Elements," his treatise on geometry, with grimy hands.
For more than 2,000 years, Euclid's text was the paradigm of mathematical argumentation and reasoning. "Euclid famously starts with 'definitions' that are almost poetic," Jeremy Avigad, a logician at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an email. "He then built the mathematics of the time on top of that, proving things in such a way that each successive step 'clearly follows' from previous ones, using the basic notions, definitions and prior theorems." There were complaints that some of Euclid's "obvious" steps were less than obvious, Dr. Avigad said, yet the system worked.
But by the 20th century, mathematicians were no longer willing to ground mathematics in this intuitive geometric foundation. Instead they developed formal systems -- precise symbolic representations, mechanical rules. Eventually, this formalization allowed mathematics to be translated into computer code. In 1976, the four-color theorem -- which states that four colors are sufficient to fill a map so that no two adjacent regions are the same color -- became the first major theorem proved with the help of computational brute force.
Now mathematicians are grappling with the latest transformative force: artificial intelligence.
In 2019, Christian Szegedy, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now at a start-up in the Bay Area, predicted that a computer system would match or exceed the problem-solving ability of the best human mathematicians within a decade. Last year he revised the target date to 2026.
Akshay Venkatesh, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and a winner of the Fields Medal in 2018, isn't currently interested in using A.I., but he is keen on talking about it. "I want my students to realize that the field they're in is going to change a lot," he said in an interview last year. He recently added by email: "I am not opposed to thoughtful and deliberate use of technology to support our human understanding. But I strongly believe that mindfulness about the way we use it is essential."
In February, Dr. Avigad attended a workshop about "machine-assisted proofs" at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. (He visited the Euclid portrait on the final day of the workshop.) The gathering drew an atypical mix of mathematicians and computer scientists. "It feels consequential," said Terence Tao, a mathematician at the university, winner of a Fields Medal in 2006 and the workshop's lead organizer.
Dr. Tao noted that only in the last couple years have mathematicians started worrying about A.I.'s potential threats, whether to mathematical aesthetics or to themselves. That prominent community members are now broaching the issues and exploring the potential "kind of breaks the taboo," he said.
One conspicuous workshop attendee sat in the front row: a trapezoidal box named "raise-hand robot" that emitted a mechanical murmur and lifted its hand whenever an online participant had a question. "It helps if robots are cute and nonthreatening," Dr. Tao said.
Bring on the "proof whiners"
These days there is no shortage of gadgetry for optimizing our lives -- diet, sleep, exercise. "We like to attach stuff to ourselves to make it a little easier to get things right," Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said during a workshop break. A.I. gadgetry might do the same for mathematics, he added: "It's very clear that the question is, What can machines do for us, not what will machines do to us."
One math gadget is called a proof assistant, or interactive theorem prover. ("Automath" was an early incarnation in the 1960s.) Step-by-step, a mathematician translates a proof into code; then a software program checks whether the reasoning is correct. Verifications accumulate in a library, a dynamic canonical reference that others can consult. This type of formalization provides a foundation for mathematics today, said Dr. Avigad, who is the director of the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics (funded by the crypto entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson), "in just the same way that Euclid was trying to codify and provide a foundation for the mathematics of his time."
Of late, the open-source proof assistant system Lean is attracting attention. Developed at Microsoft by Leonardo de Moura, a computer scientist now with Amazon, Lean uses automated reasoning, which is powered by what is known as good old-fashioned artificial intelligence, or GOFAI -- symbolic A.I., inspired by logic. So far the Lean community has verified an intriguing theorem about turning a sphere inside out as well as a pivotal theorem in a scheme for unifying mathematical realms, among other gambits.
But a proof assistant also has drawbacks: It often complains that it does not understand the definitions, axioms or reasoning steps entered by the mathematician, and for this it has been called a "proof whiner." All that whining can make research cumbersome. But Heather Macbeth, a mathematician at Fordham University, said that this same feature -- providing line-by-line feedback -- also makes the systems useful for teaching.
In the spring, Dr. Macbeth designed a "bilingual" course: She translated every problem presented on the blackboard into Lean code in the lecture notes, and students submitted solutions to homework problems both in Lean and prose. "It gave them confidence," Dr. Macbeth said, because they received instant feedback on when the proof was finished and whether each step along the way was right or wrong.
Since attending the workshop, Emily Riehl, a mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, used an experimental proof-assistant program to formalize proofs she had previously published with a co-author. By the end of a verification, she said, "I'm really, really deep into understanding the proof, way deeper than I've ever understood before. I'm thinking so clearly that I can explain it to a really dumb computer."
Brute reason -- but is it math?
Another automated-reasoning tool, used by Marijn Heule, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an Amazon scholar, is what he colloquially calls "brute reasoning" (or, more technically, a Satisfiability, or SAT, solver). By merely stating, with a carefully crafted encoding, which "exotic object" you want to find, he said, a supercomputer network churns through a search space and determines whether or not that entity exists.
Just before the workshop, Dr. Heule and one of his Ph.D. students, Bernardo Subercaseaux, finalized their solution to a longstanding problem with a file that was 50 terabytes in size. Yet that file hardly compared with a result that Dr. Heule and collaborators produced in 2016: "Two-hundred-terabyte maths proof is largest ever," a headline in Nature announced. The article went on to ask whether solving problems with such tools truly counted as math. In Dr. Heule's view, this approach is needed "to solve problems that are beyond what humans can do."
Another set of tools uses machine learning, which synthesizes oodles of data and detects patterns but is not good at logical, step-by-step reasoning. Google's DeepMind designs machine-learning algorithms to tackle the likes of protein folding (AlphaFold) and winning at chess (AlphaZero). In a 2021 Nature paper, a team described their results as "advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with A.I."
Yuhuai "Tony" Wu, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now with a start-up in the Bay Area, has outlined a grander machine-learning goal: to "solve mathematics." At Google, Dr. Wu explored how the large language models that empower chatbots might help with mathematics. The team used a model that was trained on internet data and then fine-tuned on a large math-rich data set, using, for instance, an online archive of math and science papers. When asked in everyday English to solve math problems, this specialized chatbot, named Minerva, was "pretty good at imitating humans," Dr. Wu said at the workshop. The model obtained scores that were better than an average 16-year-old student on high school math exams.
Ultimately, Dr. Wu said, he envisioned an "automated mathematician" that has "the capability of solving a mathematical theorem all by itself."
Mathematics as a litmus test
Mathematicians have responded to these disruptions with varying levels of concern.
Michael Harris, at Columbia University, expresses qualms in his "Silicon Reckoner" Substack. He is troubled by the potentially conflicting goals and values of research mathematics and the tech and defense industries. In a recent newsletter, he noted that one speaker at a workshop, "A.I. to Assist Mathematical Reasoning," organized by the National Academies of Sciences, was a representative from Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor for intelligence agencies and the military.

Dr. Harris lamented the lack of discussion about the larger implications of A.I. on mathematical research, particularly "when contrasted with the very lively conversation going on" about the technology "pretty much everywhere except mathematics."
Geordie Williamson, of the University of Sydney and a DeepMind collaborator, spoke at the N.A.S. gathering and encouraged mathematicians and computer scientists to be more involved in such conversations. At the workshop in Los Angeles, he opened his talk with a line adapted from "You and the Atom Bomb," a 1945 essay by George Orwell. "Given how likely we all are to be profoundly affected within the next five years," Dr. Williamson said, "deep learning has not roused as much discussion as might have been expected."
Dr. Williamson considers mathematics a litmus test of what machine learning can or cannot do. Reasoning is quintessential to the mathematical process, and it is the crucial unsolved problem of machine learning.
Early during Dr. Williamson's DeepMind collaboration, the team found a simple neural net that predicted "a quantity in mathematics that I cared deeply about," he said in an interview, and it did so "ridiculously accurately." Dr. Williamson tried hard to understand why -- that would be the makings of a theorem -- but could not. Neither could anybody at DeepMind. Like the ancient geometer Euclid, the neural net had somehow intuitively discerned a mathematical truth, but the logical "why" of it was far from obvious.
At the Los Angeles workshop, a prominent theme was how to combine the intuitive and the logical. If A.I. could do both at the same time, all bets would be off.
But, Dr. Williamson observed, there is scant motivation to understand the black box that machine learning presents. "It's the hackiness culture in tech, where if it works most of the time, that's great," he said -- but that scenario leaves mathematicians dissatisfied.
He added that trying to understand what goes on inside a neural net raises "fascinating mathematical questions," and that finding answers presents an opportunity for mathematicians "to contribute meaningfully to the world."

Full text: This month's picks include a visually stunning documentary about garbage, a lesbian comedy from Spain, a drama about a Bollywood-obsessed teen in 1980s Afghanistan and more.
'Matter out of Place'
Stream it on Ovid.
This documentary by Nikolaus Geyrhalter is something of a visual oxymoron: it is a visually gorgeous, even pristine, movie about, well, garbage. The Austrian filmmaker weaves together observational portraits of trash and its handlers from across the world, from immigrant cleaners at an island resort in the Maldives, to a mechanized sorting plant in Austria, to volunteers who pick up after Burning Man in the Nevada desert. But this is no navel-gazing exercise in aestheticizing detritus or finding beauty in ugly places. Rather, Geyrhalter's keen, rigorous tableaux provoke us to think about the massive global industry required to deal with the rubbish we so casually generate in our everyday culture of disposability.
The overwhelming, even breathtaking scale of certain shots -- a truck full of garbage bags is airlifted across a snowy valley; speck-size trash-pickers trawl through hills covered with litter -- remind us that our relentless consumption accumulates immense collateral, and that keeping our homes and lives clean means relegating other places and people to the dirt.
'Girlfriends and Girlfriends'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If you're looking for a movie to help close out Pride month, look no further: The Spanish filmmaker Zaida Carmona's lesbian comedy is a colorful celebration of queer joy, queer heartbreak and queer mess. Starring the director herself as a neurotic musician and aspiring filmmaker recently dumped by her lover, "Girlfriends and Girlfriends" follows Zaida as she goes to parties and therapy sessions, falls in and out of love, hooks up with the girlfriend of her best friend (who herself is having an affair with someone else) ... and so on.
The title of the film riffs on the movie "Boyfriends and Girlfriends" by the French director Eric Rohmer, whose low-key, talky features play a prominent role in the plot -- Zaida is a big fan, and many of her trysts take place at a theater screening a Rohmer retrospective. What Carmona crafts here along with her ebullient (and highly fashionable) cast is as much a homage to Rohmer's movies as a defiant gay reclamation of them. His explorations of the ins and outs of heterosexual desire are restaged in "Girlfriends and Girlfriends" within a filmic world composed almost entirely of women who date women, who may be confused in love and life but are defiant in their queerness.
'The Orphanage'
Stream it on Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When we meet Qodrat (Quodratollah Qadiri), the teenage protagonist of Shahrbanoo Sadat's coming-of-age film, he's scalping tickets outside a movie theater in Kabul that is showing the Hindi film "Shahenshah," featuring action superstar Amitabh Bachchan. It's 1989, and Afghanistan is under Soviet occupation, which means that when Qodrat is caught by the police, he's sent to a Russian-run orphanage. There, as he encounters friendship, bullying, romance and tragedy, his love of Bollywood movies keeps him going, inflecting his everyday existence with larger-than-life musical reveries.
Based on the unpublished diaries of Anwar Hashimi, who plays a teacher in the film, "The Orphanage" effortlessly balances naturalism and fantasy, levity and gravity. The scenes set within the orphanage, featuring a superb cast of nonprofessional actors, hit the familiar beats of adolescent dramas, but open up every now and then into the specific historical context of Soviet Afghanistan, as when the kids go to the U.S.S.R. on an exchange trip. As the film moves closer and closer to the Taliban takeover of Kabul, the politics of the outside world impinge on the insular institution. Yet Qodrat clings to his cinematic fantasies, in a bittersweet gesture that affirms both the hope and the futility of the movies.
'Adoration'
Stream it on Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Fabrice du Welz's beguiling Belgian thriller begins like a fairy tale. Paul (Thomas Gioria), a sensitive boy who lives in the countryside with his creepy, controlling mother, sees a blond, blue-eyed girl, Gloria (Fantine Harduin), being brought into a nearby asylum by force. She's been dispatched there by an evil uncle, she says, and soon the two children run away, fumbling like Hansel and Gretel through the verdant woods. But as Gloria turns out to be far more elusive -- and perhaps deceitful -- than Paul, and we, may have realized, their adventure confronts harsh realities of violence and mental illness.
Filmed in lush, dreamlike greens and blues, "Adoration" belongs to one of my favorite genres: movies about untrustworthy, unpredictable kids, who bait us with their innocence and then befuddle us with their cunning. Yet the film's strength is that it commits fully to its protagonists' perspectives, emphasizing how fearful and uncertain the world can seem to children who have learned a distrust of adults. As Paul, Gioria gives a performance of extraordinary tenderness, torn between fear, compassion and inklings of desire. Even as shocking twists accumulate, the film immerses us in Paul's confusion until the very end, underlining how powerfully the yearning for companionship can scramble a child's senses.
'Neelavelicham'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A dark, haunted mansion, a beautiful ghost draped in white and a story of love betrayed. Aashiq Abu's Malayalam melodrama, adapted from a renowned short story by Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, has all the elements of a classic Gothic horror brimming with desire and danger. When a writer (Tovino Thomas) moves into an abandoned house in a village, everyone warns him of the bungalow's supernatural inhabitant. But he decides to befriend the ghost, a woman named Bhargavi, who is said to have taken her own life after her betrothed left her for someone else. The writer never sees the apparition, but he speaks to her and seeks her permission to live in her home, promising to tell her tale in return. As he writes, the thrills and chills of the mansion -- creaky doors, rustling leaves, evil cats -- feed his imagination.
"Neelavelicham" combines two movies in one. When the writer finishes his story, we see it play out onscreen as a musical drama about Bhargavi, her lover and a jealous cousin. The details of the tale -- and the climactic revelation -- are fairly predictable, but the real pleasures of "Neelavelicham" are in the genre atmospherics. Abu turns the village, with its thick green foliage and damp, coastal air, into an intensely evocative setting for both romance and horror, while Rima Kallingal, who plays Bhargavi, is a pitch-perfect scream queen with her wide, kohl-lined eyes and cascade of black curls.

A Media-Rights Muddle Stifles San Diego State: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: San Diego State had to make a decision about whether to leave the Mountain West Conference. It stayed put, but a move to the Pac-12 still beckons.
The latest turn of the conference realignment carousel driven by college football took me back to the Pleistocene period of journalism, when I worked as a summer news desk clerk amid the telex machines, pneumatic tubes and desk drawers full of booze at the dearly departed Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
A sign on an editor's desk caught my eye: "Deadline is a two-syllable word." Succinct and sly, it mocked one of the newsroom's most sacrosanct tenets: Don't blow deadline.
But in the digital era of continuous publishing, the notion of a deadline -- which melds two of Merriam-Webster's more unequivocal words -- has somehow become malleable, a transformation that brings me back to the recent maneuverings of San Diego State University.
If the school was going to leave the Mountain West Conference for the Pac-12 in a year, it faced an 11 p.m. Pacific Time deadline on Friday to notify the Mountain West. Otherwise, its exit fee would double to about $ 36 million.
The problem: San Diego State did not have an offer from the Pac-12 Conference.
The reason: The Pac-12 did not have a media rights deal. (More on that in a moment.)
As the hourglass emptied on Friday, the Pac-12 chancellors and presidents convened to receive another one of their regular updates on the media rights negotiations. Later, San Diego State informed the Mountain West that it would stay put. For now.
That this unfolded on June 30 was fitting.
Last year on that date, Southern California and U.C.L.A., the Pac-12's football and basketball standard-bearers, stunned the college athletics world by deciding to bolt for the Big Ten when the Pac-12's television contract expires after the 2023-24 season.
This opened the door of opportunity for San Diego State, which has long pined for a move to the Pac-12 -- a switch that would not only confer athletics legitimacy, but also put a California State University school on equal footing with Cal-Berkeley, a flagship school in the more prestigious University of California system.
It would require a three-step process. First, the Pac-12 would secure a media rights deal. Next, the 10 remaining members (the Pac-12 hoped) would sign a grant of rights, binding them to the conference for the duration of the media rights agreement. And finally, the conference would consider expansion.
Yet a year later, the Pac-12 is still in first gear.
The Pac-12, whose current agreement with ESPN and Fox expires after this season, found itself boxed out of several options when the Big 12 surprisingly locked in its media deal with Fox and ESPN last October, two months after the Big Ten announced its deal with Fox, CBS and NBC. The Southeastern Conference's 10-year contract with ESPN kicks in next year, and the Atlantic Coast Conference's deal with ESPN runs until 2036.
That leaves few openings on the broadcast schedule to showcase the Pac-12.
"The problem for the Pac-12 is all the other cards have now been dealt," said Ed Desser, a sports media rights consultant, who noted that the only coveted spot would be Saturday night on ESPN or Friday night on ESPN, Fox, Apple or Amazon.
Negotiations have sputtered for several reasons.
First, the Pac-12 commissioner, George Kliavkoff, tried to persuade the University of California Board of Regents last fall to keep U.C.L.A. from leaving, which would have given the conference the valuable Los Angeles media market to shop around. (In December, the governing board voted not to block the move.)
Also last fall, many media companies began slashing jobs nearly across the board, particularly at Disney, which owns ESPN and said it would shed 7,000 jobs as it dealt with the continuing impact of cord cutting. And while streaming platforms like Apple and Amazon might be attractive, those companies are unlikely to view sports programming (that is not the N.F.L.) as indispensable.
It quickly became apparent that the media industry's belt-tightening would manifest itself in second-tier rights deals. Shortly after the Big 12's deal, which was largely considered below-market at $ 31.7 million per school, the Pac-12 adjusted downward by 10 percent estimates of an agreement it could reach if U.C.L.A. remained.
Then came the delays.
Expectations of an agreement by the start of the Pac-12 men's basketball tournament led to hopes of a deal by the Final Four. And then by mid-April. And then surely by the start of summer. Now, the assumption is that an announcement will be made before the Pac-12's football media day on July 21, so that the event's dominant story line is actually football.
Of course, what is in the agreement will have consequences.
The Big 12, which added Brigham Young, Cincinnati, Central Florida and Houston on Saturday, and could lose Texas and Oklahoma this time next year, is interested in poaching any Pac-12 school that is unhappy enough to jump if the payout is significantly below what the Big 12 is receiving.
In that case, it would not take much -- Colorado and Arizona leaving, perhaps, or Utah -- for the Pac-12 to disintegrate.
These are the scenarios that San Diego State had to game out. The Aztecs, who came within one final push of winning a men's basketball championship and who regularly exhibit a quietly competent football team, are in a familiar spot. They agreed in 2011 to jump to the Big East for football, while playing in the Big West for other sports. But two years later, that agreement collapsed and they remained in the Mountain West.
Last month, the San Diego State president, Adela de la Torre, wrote a letter to the Mountain West saying the school intended to leave and asking for more time. A flurry of back-and-forth letters ensued.
In the end, San Diego State determined that its conference exit may well be negotiable, as many before it have been. And so the school concluded that if a move to the Pac-12 were to happen, it would happen in time -- deadlines be damned.

Court Expands Protections Based on Faith: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The unanimous decision interpreted a federal civil rights law to require employers to make substantial efforts to accommodate their workers' religious practices.
The Supreme Court broadened protections on Thursday for religious workers in a case that involved a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service who refused to work on his Sabbath.
In a unanimous decision, the justices rejected a test that had long been used to determine what accommodations an employer must make for religious workers, but declined to rule on the merits of the case, sending it back to a lower court to consider under a new standard.
Writing for the court, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that the case gave it the "first opportunity in nearly 50 years" to explain the nuances of how workplaces must adapt to religious requests by employees.
For an employer to deny an employee's request or a religious accommodation, Justice Alito wrote, it "must show that the burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business."
The decision could affect countless workplaces and could require many employers to make substantial changes to accommodate religious workers.
The ruling is the latest in a series by the court that have focused on expanding the role of religion in public life, sometimes at the expense of other values, like gay rights and access to contraception.
In the past few years, the Supreme Court has ruled that a high school football coach had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team's games, that state programs supporting private schools in Maine and Montana must include religious ones, that a Catholic social services agency in Philadelphia could defy city rules and refuse to work with same-sex couples who apply to take in foster children and that the Trump administration could allow employers with religious objections to deny contraception coverage to female workers.
The latest decision may be less divisive than some of the court's recent rulings on religion, in part because protecting observance of the Sabbath may not split Americans along the usual lines. Indeed, liberal justices have tried in the past to shield workers from discipline and termination for following their faith, and all three on the court signed onto the decision.
The case was brought by Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian and former missionary who worked as a substitute mail carrier. After the Postal Service made a deal with Amazon in 2013 to deliver packages on Sundays, Mr. Groff said he had to choose between his faith and his livelihood, opting to quit after being disciplined for missing work.
"I felt that I had a decision between what the post office wanted and what God wanted of me," Mr. Groff said in an interview on Thursday. "I hope that this is inspiring to people because in America we do have these freedoms and they're protected."
The Postal Service said in a statement that it was confident that it would prevail once the lower court reconsidered the case.
Mr. Groff was represented by First Liberty Institute, which describes itself as the largest legal organization in the nation focused exclusively on defending religious freedom.
Kelly Shackelford, the president and chief counsel of First Liberty, welcomed the ruling, saying that it restored "religious freedom to every American in the workplace."
"This decision will positively help millions and millions of Americans -- those who work now and their children and grandchildren," he said.
American Atheists, which advocates secularism in governmental policies and which submitted an amicus brief in support of the Postal Service in the case, Groff v. DeJoy, No. 22-174, said the ruling continued a worrying trend.
"While today's decision doesn't give religious employees carte blanche in the workplace, it certainly continues this court's recent practice of expanding loopholes, accommodations and 'rights' for the religious while shifting more burdens onto atheists, humanists and the nonreligious," said Geoffrey T. Blackwell, litigation counsel for the group.
Mr. Groff had sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that requires employers to "reasonably accommodate" workers' religious practice so long as they can do so "without undue hardship" to the company's business.
A 1977 precedent, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, stood in his way. That decision said that employers need not accommodate workers if the effort imposed more than a trifling, or "de minimis," burden on their businesses.
Lawyers for the Postal Service argued that Mr. Groff's refusal to work on Sundays imposed a significant burden on a small post office, was in tension with an agreement with a labor union and was bad for other workers' morale.
Lower courts ruled against Mr. Groff. Judge Patty Shwartz, writing for a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, said that "exempting Groff from working on Sundays caused more than a de minimis cost on U.S.P.S. because it actually imposed on his co-workers, disrupted the workplace and work flow, and diminished employee morale."
In dissent, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman wrote that "the majority renders any burden on employees sufficient to establish undue hardship, effectively subjecting Title VII religious accommodation to a heckler's veto by disgruntled employees."

Full text: Since the late '70s, Manchester, in the north of England, has been a focal point for British pop culture. The city is still mostly known by the rest of the world for the bands it helped produce: Joy Division, New Order, the Stone Roses, Oasis and the Smiths all have ties to the city.
Now a new multipurpose arts venue aims to cement Manchester as a destination for the fine arts, too. It marks how the city's cultural scene has transformed in recent decades, from a site for D.I.Y art-making to a desirable home for large-scale investment and corporate sponsorship.
Aviva Studios, named for the insurance company that provided some of the funding, opens in Manchester's city center at the end of the month. It is a huge, highly configurable space that includes a nearly 70-foot-high, 5,000-capacity warehouse venue and a 1,500-seat auditorium. It will also provide a permanent home to the multidisciplinary Manchester International Festival.
The venue was initially named Factory International, after the local club night that became Joy Division and New Order's record label, but a name change accompanied the announcement of Aviva's sponsorship deal on Tuesday.
The expensive new institution, largely funded with public money, now faces the problem of connecting to a city with an increasingly complicated identity.
After years of postindustrial decline, Manchester has recently had a development and property boom, with its city-center population ballooning, and Microsoft and Amazon opening large offices in the area. But that prosperity hasn't always been shared by the rest of the city, and in the Greater Manchester region, more than a quarter of children were living in poverty in 2021, according to government data. The city is also more racially diverse than much of the rest of Britain.
"Manchester is, in a sense, a complicated public for elite arts to connect to, with very different populations," said Joshi Herrmann, founder of The Mill, a local newsletter. "Trying to find stuff that reaches across those different divides is really, really difficult."
Herrmann pointed to recent projects that have tried: The Guardian's "Cotton Capital" project, which analyzed Manchester's role in the slave trade; Manchester Museum's curatorial shift to embrace the city's South Asian population; and a spate of recent books that complicate dominant narratives around Oasis, Factory Records and the heady days of the Haçienda nightclub.
Aviva Studios "is a space for making and exploring the possibilities of new large-scale work," said John McGrath, the site's chief executive and artistic director. The space opens on June 30 with "You, Me and the Balloons," a site-specific installation by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, and this summer it will host some of the festival's performances, including those by the psychedelic jazz band The Comet is Coming and the cabaret artist Justin Vivian Bond.
The first in-house production -- the "Matrix"-inspired dance show "Free Your Mind," directed by Danny Boyle -- will be the centerpiece of a nine-day "welcome party" for Aviva Studios in October.
Since before plans for the new venue were announced, the Manchester International Festival has been grappling with how to balance attracting artists from around the world with speaking to and representing local residents. Founded in 2007, the festival was at first very focused on mounting large-scale productions and "bringing extraordinary work from around the world" to Manchester, said McGrath, who is also the festival's artistic director. In its early days, "there was a sense that the festival wasn't necessarily connecting in a deep way with the city," he added.
The biennial festival is still seen by many of Manchester's residents as "a niche cultural product," said Andy Spinoza, the author of the book "Manchester Unspun." He said many of its productions were devised outside of the city and were later exported to other international arts festivals. Though the Aviva deal "enables the doors to open and the overrun of costs to be settled," he said, the corporate sponsorship feels "a long way" from club nights at the Factory.
One clear benefit to the city is the jobs Aviva Studios is expected to create. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester's City Council, said the venue would add 1,500 direct and indirect jobs in the next decade, alongside the new Factory Academy, which trains local people for technical jobs within the creative industries. McGrath estimated the venue would generate 1.1 billion pounds, or $ 1.4 billion, for the local economy over the next decade.
The venue is the largest investment in a single arts project by the British government since Tate Modern opened in 2000. Its cost has increased significantly, from £78 million when it was announced in 2014, to more than £210 million in the most recent City Council budget.
Manchester's local government provided around half of that total, with the venue also receiving £106 million from the national government (via the Treasury and Arts Council England) plus £9 million a year toward running costs. The multiyear Aviva deal added another £35 million, The Guardian reported, which, City Council documents from October show, will go in part toward repaying council borrowing.
Aviva Studios opens as public funding for the arts in Britain is increasingly being redistributed, from London to the rest of the country, and from larger institutions to smaller ones. In November, Arts Council England announced that organizations like the English National Opera and the Barbican Center were losing their government subsidies. This was part of the British government's commitment, announced in February last year, to increasing cultural investment and grass-roots access to the arts outside of London.
While the Manchester venue represents a significant investment in the arts outside of London, it is still an example of funding being channeled into a large, centralized institution.
In some ways, Aviva Studios completes the Manchester festival's transition from what Spinoza describes as a "guerrilla arts movement using found spaces around the city" to the "big institutional edifice of today," as both arts funding and Manchester's identity become more complex and fragmented.
Along with excitement, the venue's opening has also been met with skepticism from some locals who, Herrmann said, believe the money should have been split across numerous cultural projects in the area. Local reactions to Aviva's sponsorship have also been "definitely negative," he added, even though pragmatic attitudes to private investment have been "a big part of Manchester's story" since the 1980s.
Ahead of the opening next week, the success of Aviva Studios is still up in the air, Spinoza said. If it can indeed provide transformative cultural experiences, he said, "people might start to believe it might be worth it."

Chiefs of Microsoft and Activision Testify That Merger Would Benefit Consumers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In federal court, Satya Nadella and Bobby Kotick opposed an attempt by the F.T.C. to delay Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of a video game giant.
Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, appeared in federal court on Wednesday to pledge his support for open platforms and consumer choice, underscoring the tech giant's commitment to closing its $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over regulators' objections.
"If it was up to me, I would love to get rid of the entire 'exclusives on consoles,"' Mr. Nadella testified, rebutting claims from tech regulators that Microsoft's deal for the video game giant would curtail competition and restrict Activision's games only to players on Microsoft's Xbox console. "I have no love for that world."
The fourth day of a hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that could determine the deal's outcome was the highest-profile session, with appearances by Mr. Nadella and Activision's chief executive, Bobby Kotick.
The Federal Trade Commission's challenge of the blockbuster acquisition, led by its chair, Lina Khan, is viewed as a test of whether more aggressive efforts to curb tech giants can be successful. The F.T.C. is seeking a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the companies from closing the deal before the agency has the chance to argue its case in its internal court.
Microsoft has said such a lengthy delay would most likely doom the deal, a perspective that Mr. Kotick shared in his testimony on Wednesday.
The F.TC. has argued that the merger would harm competition in the video game industry and hurt consumers, because Microsoft could pull Activision's games, like Call of Duty, from its rival Sony's PlayStation console. Mr. Kotick promised that he had no intention of doing so, though the decision will not ultimately be his if his company is acquired.
"You would have a revolt if you were to remove the game from one platform," Mr. Kotick said. "It would cause reputational damage to the company." Mr. Nadella likewise said he would not withhold Call of Duty.
Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. has sued Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, arguing that Big Tech's immense power over communications, social media and online commerce allows the companies to build monopolies and harm consumers.
After Microsoft announced early last year that it intended to reshape its Xbox business by buying Activision, the company struck agreements with other video game companies, like Nintendo, to show regulators that the deal would benefit gamers and not curtail access to Activision's games.
Most government agencies, including the European Commission, were convinced. But the F.T.C. and the Competition and Markets Authority in Britain are trying to block the deal.
Court arguments have focused on the practice of exclusivity -- releasing a highly anticipated game only on one console. Microsoft has repeatedly promised it will not make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox if it acquires Activision, and offered Sony a contract putting that guarantee in writing.
But the F.T.C. argued in court last week that Microsoft had moved swiftly to buy ZeniMax Media and its slate of gaming studios for $ 7.5 billion in 2020 when it realized that Sony might pay to make one of ZeniMax's important upcoming games, Starfield, exclusive to PlayStation. New ZeniMax titles, including Starfield, are now exclusive to the Xbox.
Jim Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, testified in a recorded video deposition that he thought that even if Call of Duty remained on PlayStation, Microsoft would try to "drive PlayStation gamers to the Xbox platforms" by somehow degrading the Call of Duty experience on PlayStation.
"I believe that they're going to use Call of Duty somehow to damage us," Mr. Ryan said.
But Mr. Nadella testified that he opposed a walled-off approach to gaming.
"I grew up in a company that always believed that software should run on as many platforms as possible," he said. "And I believe in that."
Microsoft has sought to portray itself as a distant third in a three-player console market dominated by Nintendo and Sony. Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, said that as a third-place competitor, Xbox was "not a robust business."
Mr. Spencer did acknowledge that Microsoft has had discussions about potentially excluding Activision games other than Call of Duty from PlayStation.
The F.T.C. has argued that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision would also give it an unfair advantage in gaming subscription services and the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley is expected to decide whether to grant the injunction before July 18, the date the deal is expected to close. At times, her courtroom questions have been skeptical of some of the F.T.C.'s arguments.
The F.T.C., for example, tried to get Mr. Spencer to swear he would put Call of Duty on PlayStation for at least 10 years, no matter what terms Sony requested as part of that agreement. Judge Corley seemed to feel that such a blanket promise was unrealistic, especially if Sony asked for something unreasonable, like receiving Call of Duty for free.
"Well, it's not going to be for zero dollars," Judge Corley said, sounding impatient. "That was understood."

Indigenous Guardsmen Become Colombia's Unexpected Heroes: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: At first, he heard a soft cry. Then, just beyond the broad leaves of the jungle, Nicolás Ordóñez could make out the form of a small girl, a baby in her arms.
Mr. Ordóñez, 27, a young man from the humblest of backgrounds, stepped forward, soon to become a national hero. He and three other men had found four Colombian children who had survived a terrifying plane crash followed by 40 harrowing days in the Amazon rain forest -- and whose plight had drawn worldwide attention.
But these men did not wear the uniform of the Colombian military, or any other force backed by millions of dollars mobilized for the massive search.
Instead, they were members of a civilian patrol known as the Indigenous Guard -- a confederation of defense groups that have sought to protect broad swaths of Indigenous territory from violence and environmental destruction linked to the country's long internal conflict.
Many in the guard say their cause has long been marginalized. Now, they are at the center of the country's biggest story.
"What we are, the Indigenous guards, has been made visible," said Luis Acosta, who coordinates the multiple groups collectively known as the Indigenous Guard. "I think that this may gain us respect and gain us recognition."
While the guardsmen still do not know how the four children survived the jungle, interviews in their hometown along Colombia's southern edge provide the deepest account yet about what led them to the moment of the rescue.
Colombia's Indigenous guardsmen usually wear cloth vests and carry wooden staffs, not guns. And yet over the years they have resisted incursions by left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, oil companies and even Colombia's security forces.
Their sudden thrust into a global spotlight started in May, after a single-propeller plane went down in the remote Colombian Amazon.
A search team soon found the bodies of the three adults aboard -- but its four young passengers were missing, setting off an intense, anguished search that involved an unlikely cooperation between the military and the Indigenous Guard.
The children, ages 1 to 13, are siblings from an Indigenous group called the Huitoto, who are also known as the Murui Muina.
They had boarded the plane with their mother, a community leader and the pilot to escape violence from a faction of a left-wing guerrilla group in their Amazonian town, according to Manuel Ranoque, the father of the two youngest children. (The guerrilla group, in text messages to The Times, denied that.)
The rescue team's work captivated people around the globe, and when the children were found alive on June 9, Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, hailed the joining of forces between the Indigenous Guard and the military as a symbol of a "new Colombia."
Mr. Ordóñez and the three other men who found the children -- Eliecer Muñoz, Dairo Kumariteke and Edwin Manchola -- are all from Puerto Leguízamo, a town at the southern edge of the Colombian Amazon where the drug trade reigns and armed groups fight for control of the industry. They are also Murui Muina.
On a recent day in Puerto Leguízamo, Mr. Ordóñez and others sat in a round meetinghouse known among Indigenous groups as a maloca and described why they had signed up for the rescue mission. Light streaked through a thatch roof. A bowl of brilliant green mambe, a mild stimulant made of ground coca leaf sacred to the tribe, sat in the center of the dirt floor.
Mr. Ordóñez, born in a town of just seven families, left school at age 10 to begin working, moving boxes at a grocery store in exchange for his pick of damaged produce.
Then, when he was 14, he was recruited by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the leftist guerrilla group that fought the Colombian government for decades, terrorizing the nation. He said he joined voluntarily, out of economic desperation.
His experience is not unique: thousands of children have been recruited by armed groups during the country's long war.
As a minor, Mr. Ordóñez said, he was not assigned armed combat. But he quickly became disillusioned with the group's violent tactics, and when he was captured by the military a year later, he saw it as divine intervention.
The improbability of his rise from fighting the state to working alongside it did not escape him.
"Just yesterday I was an enemy of these people, and now I am working for them," he said. "How crazy!"
At age 15, Mr. Ordóñez entered a government reintegration program for child victims of recruitment. Over the next three years, he took courses in governance and did community service in violence-ridden neighborhoods, he said. When he was 18, he returned to Puerto Leguízamo and had a "spiritual revolution," immersing himself in Indigenous customs.
In May, the Indigenous Guard called, asking him if he wanted to become an official member. He agreed. Days later, he answered a call for volunteers to join the government effort -- named Operation Hope -- to find the missing siblings.
Once a child member of an armed group, he had a new mission: "That is my war now," he said. "To rescue children."
The current Indigenous Guard is a byproduct of Colombia's conflict, whose modern history many trace to the creation of the FARC, which promised to overthrow the government and redistribute land and wealth.
At least 450,000 people were killed, either at the hands of right-wing paramilitaries, the FARC, the military or other armed groups. A peace agreement in 2016 led the FARC to lay down its arms. But violence persists, with old and new groups battling for territorial control.
The modern Indigenous Guard was created around 20 years ago to protect communities from armed groups, said Mr. Acosta, the coordinator.
Sometimes the guards work together, marching through Bogotá, the capital, to protest violence. Other times, they work separately, patrolling their territories.
In all, the country's guards have tens of thousands of members, Mr. Acosta said.
Men, women and children as young as 13 can join, he added. Members are taught first aid and given lessons in history and politics.
Mr. Muñoz, 48, another member who found the children, was also driven to help in the search because of the conflict.
Mr. Muñoz joined the Colombian military at 18, and returned to his community more than a decade later, after he heard his father and brother had disappeared, which he believed to be the work of an armed group. (At least 120,000 Colombians were victims of forced disappearance between 1985 and 2016, according to the government.)
He combed the region looking for information, but never learned why they were taken or what happened to them.
"I'm putting myself in your shoes," he told the children's father when he joined the search. "I know what it is to suffer and to know that you would give up your life for your family."
In all, about 300 people participated in the search, according to the military. Members of the Indigenous Guard and the military have spoken positively of their collaboration, explaining that the combination of the military's technology and the guard's ancestral knowledge was key to finding the children.
The group from Puerto Leguízamo spent three weeks sleeping in the jungle.
They braved wild animals, venomous snakes and poisonous plants in the oppressive heat of the forest, where trees 100 feet high or taller can block light. Once, the rescue team found a diaper. Another time, a footprint. Each discovery cheered the team, but despair set in when hard rains stopped the search.
On Friday, June 9, the military told the Puerto Leguízamo group to go on alone, without accompanying soldiers, something they had never done before.
The Indigenous guards were exhausted but determined.
After a few hours, when they sat down to share some mambé, Mr. Muñoz picked up a tortoise.
"If you give me the children, I will let you go," he said. "If you don't give me the children, I will eat you."
They trudged another quarter mile up a steep hill when around 2 p.m. they heard a cry.
"The children!" they said.
Mr. Ordóñez, who had his eyes on the ground looking for signs of life, stopped in his tracks. He moved slowly toward the sound of the noise. When he lifted his head, there was Lesly, 13, holding the hand of her sister Soleiny, 9, who held the baby, Cristin, 1, in her arms.
The 5-year-old boy, Tien Noriel, was nearby, lying on a bed of leaves.
Mr. Ordóñez, wanting to comfort the children, told them that they came from the same people. "We are family," he said. Then the children hugged their rescuers.
At that moment, Mr. Kumariteke broke the relative silence of the jungle and began singing, giving thanks to God.
Each guardsman carried a child. Mr. Ordóñez ferried Lesly on his back for hours down the mountain back to a military meeting point.
As part of the deal, they set the turtle free.

Full text: The Adult Swim series, from the acclaimed animator Genndy Tartakovsky, wraps up its first season this week. Our critic breaks down his other shows.
On Friday, "Unicorn: Warriors Eternal," the latest series from the famed animator Genndy Tartakovsky, will wrap up its first season on Adult Swim. Decades in the making, this show about a group of immortal fighters was a passion project for Tartakovsky, who is best known for award-winning series like "Primal" and "Samurai Jack." While "Unicorn," which is streaming on the Adult Swim website and on Max, has many of the animator's signatures, it does not always deliver to the standard of some of his earlier series.
What does "Unicorn" do well and less well? And what should you watch next if the series served as your introduction to Tartakovsky? I have broken down the good, the bad and the middling of his oeuvre -- specifically TV series that he created and had the most creative control over (so no "Powerpuff Girls" or "Hotel Transylvania") -- and how "Unicorn" fits in with the rest.
'Dexter's Laboratory' (1996-2003)
A zany and fast-paced series about a boy genius named Dexter and his inventions, which are often destroyed by his ballet-dancing older sister, Dee Dee, "Dexter's Laboratory" is one of the original series that defined Cartoon Network in the 1990s. Though it lacks the loftier intentions of "Samurai Jack," "Primal" and, now, "Unicorn," it delivers in fun, original narratives and stellar sound design.
The show premiered as part of Cartoon Network's animated anthology series "What a Cartoon!" in 1995 with a few short pilots. It graduated to a full series the following year, with a variety of short segments in each episode, including fun superhero parodies like "Dial M for Monkey" and "Justice Friends," featuring goofs on Captain America, Thor and the Hulk.
The series's main appeal, however, is its fantastical plot twists and developments within the span of stories that are just a few minutes long. "Dexter's Laboratory" has a total of four seasons but Tartakovsky left after the second, and the series lost much of its comedic charms. Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
'Samurai Jack' (2001-04, 2017)
An impressive marriage of classic kung fu movie conventions and futuristic sci-fi dystopia, "Samurai Jack" is not just an example of Tartakovsky's animation at its best, but a masterful work in its own right. As in "Dexter Laboratory," the animation in "Samurai Jack" is full of sharp, geometric silhouettes and bold colors. But "Jack," like "Unicorn," uses a wider swath of artistic reference points, including paintings of the Edo and Meiji eras and Impressionist-style watercolor paintings.
"Unicorn" comes the closest of Tartakovsky's series to matching the stunning imagination behind the worlds and characters in "Samurai Jack," which incorporates lengthy, intricately directed action sequences, split screens, modular frames and various aspect ratios. The sound design is so tactile that you can practically feel each stab, crunch or slice.
Through Jack's classic hero's journey, his noble questing and his encounters with new places and people who need his help, the series gives its story an epic scope. However, that narrative, with its repetitive "Kung Fu" western formula, can start to feel dull after a few episodes, but the revamped final season in 2017 was an improvement.
Though the story doesn't always take off, "Samurai Jack" follows a fascinating line of questioning about what it means to control a historical narrative and how fascism is born and perpetuated through physical and mental slavery and oppression. Plus, it had an awesome theme song. Stream it on Max.
'Star Wars: Clone Wars' (2003-05)
Separate from the C.G.I. show "Star Wars: The Clone Wars," from 2008, this series explored the years between "Star Wars" films -- specifically "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith" -- long before Disney+ arrived with its ever-expanding cache of spinoffs. But the show succeeds where so many of the franchise's extensions fail by including enough familiar characters to satisfy fans while pushing the story into invigorating new directions.
In terms of the action sequences, "Clone Wars" and "Samurai Jack" are both first-rate, but the former's combination of light-saber fighting and Jedi parkour, gymnastics and force-pushes makes for a more dynamic watch.
Tartakovsky proves to be the perfect match for George Lucas, who is notorious for writing dialogue as stiff as the hinges of an unoiled C-3PO. Tartakovsky's minimalist approach to dialogue allows the visuals and unfolding action to speak for themselves; the additions he does make, like fresh exchanges between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and the introduction of a new sith-in-training named Asajj Ventress, further illuminate the workings of the "Star Wars" universe. Stream it on Disney+.
'Sym-Bionic Titan' (2010-11)
In this throwback to '80s and '90s fantasy mecha (read: giant robot) shows, a princess, a moody warrior sent to protect her and a robot escape a war on their home planet to settle on Earth as normal human high schoolers. But when their enemies pursue them to Earth, the three discover that they can "Voltron" themselves together into a giant robot fighter via a psychic link, à la "Neon Genesis Evangelion."
This show somehow manages to be too much and not enough: too much camp without the bite, too much earnest replication of the flashy '80s and '90s animation style, too mecha and yet too little humor, too little grounding, too little nuance. The humor is D.O.A., the jokes and cookie-cutter dramatic scenarios (fish out of water, a wacky intrusive neighbor) are set up neatly but executed without finesse or charm.
The backdrops still have the clean, simple lines and balanced palettes of Tartakovsky's other work. But they get quickly swallowed by the unctuous gleam and artificial gloss of the central action sequences and by character art that feels dated and muddled, a mix between decades old anime and saturated graphic novels of the previous 10-15 years.
"Sym-Bionic Titan" stands out as one of the more loquacious series in Tartakovsky's career. It shares this quality with "Dexter's Laboratory," but "Sym-Bionic Titan" is more awkward and cringe-worthy. Rent it on iTunes.
'Primal' (2019-present)
At a glance, you might expect "Primal" to be defined by viciousness and machismo -- "Metalocalypse" but with dinosaurs. The series, about a primitive man and a dinosaur traveling together, bonded by grief, is violent and masculine. But it is never gratuitous, even when a dying woolly mammoth's eye looks out pleadingly before being blinded by a sharp stone.
That wounded eye says it all. The show, which was renewed for a third season earlier this month, is grounded in a brutal, unflinching philosophy of empathy and survival, exploring how empathy can be both a necessity and hindrance in a fight for survival.
From its visual artistry to its unblinking, unsentimental depiction of connection and loss to its well-placed moments of levity, "Primal" feels like a natural evolution for Tartakovsky's style and writing following "Samurai Jack." The animator has tended toward spare dialogue, but "Primal" is practically nonverbal. The result is a captivating series that pulls you in to its world and doesn't let go. Stream it on Max.
'Unicorn: Warriors Eternal' (2023)
Tartakovsky started this series about 20 years ago, around the time he concluded work on "Samurai Jack" and "Clone Wars." But "Unicorn," which has been popular but has not yet been renewed for another season, has neither the sophistication of the former nor the fine-tuned action of the latter.
The warriors of the title are magical immortals who are repeatedly reborn as different, seemingly ordinary individuals in order to fight an ancient evil -- a robot named Copernicus locates each reborn warrior and awakens their dormant powers. "Unicorn" centers on the journey of Emma, who is struggling to adapt to her recently activated warrior alter ego, Melinda, a sorceress with devastating destructive power. She's joined by Edred, a Legolas-type elven swordsman who was Melinda's lover in a previous life, and Seng, a floating bald kid who recalls Avatar Aang, drifting in and out of the astral plane.
Tartakovsky drew from Hayao Miyazaki ("Howl's Moving Castle," "Castle in the Sky") for the wonderfully fantastical 19th-century steampunk setting -- Copernicus's speechless reactions, spare but full of meaning, are classic Tartakovsky. But the rest of the storytelling is more traditional, and it is flattened by a humdrum plot and a poorly written female protagonist.
Tartakovsky's projects tend to be predominantly male, so perhaps it is unsurprising that Emma/Melinda is saddled with a pat dilemma meant to give her character emotional complexity. She's caught between a meek, accommodating persona and that of a powerful entity, a well-worn trope from animated series, especially anime. (See "Yu-Gi-Oh!" and "Jujutsu Kaisen," among others.) It doesn't help that her identity crisis is conflated with a romantic crisis, as lovers from the two halves of her life vie for her affection.
Ultimately "Unicorn" builds worlds and mythologies but not the urgent stakes or interesting characters to drive them. For all of the magic in the series, it is missing the magic of Tartakovsky at his best. Stream it on AdultSwim.com and Max.

Full text: The company bought a shuttered General Motors plant in Ohio but struggled to produce its pickup truck.
Lordstown Motors, the troubled electric vehicle company that bought a shuttered General Motors factory in Ohio with grand plans to create the Tesla of pickup trucks, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.
Once hailed by former President Donald J. Trump for preserving manufacturing jobs, the company struggled with a series of development setbacks and frequent management changes, and managed to make and sell only a handful of trucks.
The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, in federal court in Delaware, was prompted by a dispute with a major investor, Foxconn, the contract manufacturer that is based in Taiwan. Foxconn said Lordstown had breached their investment agreement because its stock had fallen below $ 1 a share. Lordstown said on Tuesday that it had filed a lawsuit asserting that Foxconn failed to honor its agreement to invest more money in the company.
Lordstown said in a statement that it was starting a "a strategic restructuring process" that was likely to involve selling its remaining assets, such as the technology and intellectual property it developed for its Endurance pickup truck.
"We will vigorously pursue our litigation claims against Foxconn accordingly," Lordstown's chief executive, Edward Hightower, said.
Foxconn -- whose formal name is Hon Hai Technology Group -- said in a statement that it had hoped to negotiate a solution to Lordstown's financial troubles but that the two sides had failed to reach an agreement. Lordstown "has continuously attempted to mislead the public, and has been reluctant to perform the investment agreement between the two parties in accordance with its terms," Foxconn said.
Lordstown is one of several electric vehicle start-ups that have run into trouble over the last couple of years. Rivian, which is backed by Amazon, has suffered production delays and produced far fewer sport utility vehicles, pickups and delivery vans than it had expected. Other companies that have struggled to start or increase production include Arrival, Canoo, Lucid and Nikola.
Arrival, Canoo, Lordstown, Lucid and Nikola gained stock listings by merging with special purpose acquisition companies, taking advantage of a Wall Street craze that allowed corporate executives and investors to take businesses public without going through the more rigorous and regulated process of selling shares through initial public offerings.
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry, said Lordstown's repeated production delays and quality problems had hurt its credibility with investors and potential customers.
"Given the problems other E.V. start-ups are facing, the liquidation value of Lordstown is going to be low," he said.
The factory deal promoted by Mr. Trump never quite lived up to expectations. At its peak in 2021, Lordstown Motors employed about 600 people, fewer than half the 1,400 people G.M. employed when it halted production of the Chevrolet Cruze at the Ohio factory in 2019.
Almost all of G.M.'s workers in Lordstown, which is between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, accepted retirement packages or transferred to the company's other plants. G.M. has built a new battery factory near its former Lordstown car plant that employs about 1,100 people.
Lordstown Motors was founded in 2018 by Steve Burns, the former chief executive of Workhorse Group, a small producer of commercial vehicles. At Workhorse, Mr. Burns came up with a concept for an electric pickup truck but lacked the resources to produce it. He saw an opportunity when G.M. announced that it was closing the Lordstown plant.
Mr. Trump put immense pressure on G.M. and its chief executive, Mary T. Barra, to find a buyer for the factory, and the automaker began negotiating with Mr. Burns. Mr. Trump promoted the deal on Twitter even before an agreement was signed -- and even before Mr. Burns had financing or a name for his new company.
Lordstown had hoped to produce an innovative truck with electric motors on each of its wheel hubs, but struggled to turn its idea into a vehicle that it could mass produce.
In 2021, Mr. Burns and Lordstown were accused of exaggerating how many orders the company had for its truck by Hindenburg Research, a small investment firm. Mr. Burns resigned.
Lawyers for Mr. Burns did not respond to requests for comment.
Lordstown was burning through cash and sold its factory to Foxconn, which is best known for assembling Apple's iPhones at factories in China. In exchange for the plant, Foxconn invested millions into Lordstown and was supposed to manufacture the Endurance pickup.
But the truck was plagued with problems. One test vehicle caught fire in Michigan. Production finally started last year, but only 31 trucks were built in the last three months of 2022. In the first three months of this year, Lordstown delivered two trucks to customers, generated revenue of just $ 189,000 and reported a loss of $ 171 million.
In March, when Lordstown's stock fell below the $ 1 minimum required for a Nasdaq listing, Foxconn informed the company that it was backing out of plans to invest in it further.
Shares of Lordstown closed down 17 percent on Tuesday, to $ 2.29. They had traded at around $ 400, adjusted for a reverse stock split this spring, in early 2021. Lordstown listed its shares in October 2020 by merging with DiamondPeak Holdings.

KPMG Is Laying Off 5% Of Employees in the U.S.
KPMG is laying off 5 percent of its U.S. employees after feeling the pinch of "economic headwinds, coupled with historically low attrition," a spokesperson for the accounting giant said on Monday.
The firm had over 39,000 employees in the United States at the end of its last fiscal year on Sept. 30.
KPMG, which cut about 2 percent of its U.S. work force in February, according to a Financial Times report, was the first of the world's four biggest accountancy firms to slash jobs in the country. The latest round of job cuts will take place through the rest of its 2023 financial year, the firm said.
"We do not take this decision lightly. However, we believe it is in the best long-term interest of our firm and will position us for continued success into the future," KPMG said in a statement.
Several companies have trimmed their head count to batten down the hatches in anticipation of a potential economic downturn later in the year. REUTERS
TRAVEL
Carnival Lowers Forecasts As Myriad Costs Rise
The cruise operator Carnival on Monday forecast third-quarter profit largely below estimates as rising marketing and labor costs eat into gains from higher ticket prices and strong demand.
The company's shares, which had surged nearly 80 percent in the past two months on resurgent demand for cruises, dropped more than 7 percent by the close of the trading day.
Carnival has increased spending on marketing to attract new customers and gain an edge over its competitors even as it faces elevated labor costs as it adds staff to manage higher occupancy levels and battles higher fuel prices.
David Bernstein, chief financial officer, said a slower-than-expected drop in inflation with respect to port expenses, freight and crew travel has pushed the company to raise its cost outlook.
Still, Carnival lowered its annual loss forecast, banking on higher ticket prices and U.S. customers shelling out money on novel services such as cruise travel even as they cut spending on nonessential goods. REUTERS
TECHNOLOGY
Amazon Plans to Expand Data Operations in Ohio
Amazon's profitable cloud business will invest roughly $ 7.8 billion by the end of 2029 to expand its data center operations in central Ohio, state leaders announced Monday, further advancing the state's efforts to establish itself as the Midwest's technology hub.
The new investments by Amazon Web Services, or AWS, were announced by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, who leads the governor's technology office. The financial outlay "further cements Ohio as the heart of our nation's technology and innovation," the governor said in a statement.
AWS launched its first data centers in the region in 2016 and currently operates campuses in two counties in central Ohio, home to the capital city of Columbus. The administration said numerous locations are being considered as sites for the new data centers, in a selection to be announced later this year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google's New Pixel Phone Makes the Case for Foldables: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google's new $ 1,800 gadget proves that phones with bendable screens are something people might want. Now they just need to get cheaper.
When I recently turned on Google's new Pixel Fold smartphone and unfolded it as if it were a book, it transformed into a miniature tablet, similar to an iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. Then something unexpected happened.
For the next few hours, I found it difficult to put the device down, as if I were sucked into a great novel. The phone's performance was smooth and fast, and the bigger screen made reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen.
I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware. But I immediately knew the Pixel Fold -- Google's first foldable phone -- was different.
When I folded the device back up, a second 5.8-inch outer screen illuminated, converting it into a regular smartphone that could be used with one hand. Importantly, it was not too chunky -- it's about half an inch thick folded up, which is slightly bigger than my iPhone -- so it was comfortable to carry in my pockets.
The Pixel Fold, which was unveiled last month and arrives on Wednesday, is proof that when cutting-edge technology emerges, it is wiser to wait before sinking your hard-earned dollars into it. In just four years, Google has managed to erase most of the problems with foldable phones, transforming a gimmicky concept into a product with compelling reasons to exist.
What Google didn't manage to do was make foldable phone technology cheaper. The Pixel Fold costs $ 1,800, about $ 400 more than similar phones released a few years ago. Google said the device's cost partly stemmed from the engineering challenge of cramming high-quality components, including a camera on a par with other Pixel phones, into a device this thin. (When unfolded, the Pixel Fold is thinner than a typical smartphone.)
That's a bummer. Most people won't spend this much on a phone when there are many great options that are cheaper. But I can recommend it for its target audience: people with lots of disposable income who rely heavily on their devices.
Still, the progress with foldable technology is good news. A few years ago, handsets from companies like Apple and Samsung seemed to have peaked. Their flagship phones were already incredibly zippy, their screens were big and bright, and their cameras took stunning photos. The smartphone industry, as a whole, became a pile of nearly indistinguishable black rectangles.
What was left to do? In 2019, Samsung was among the first to release a foldable phone, but it poisoned the well by rushing the gadget to market. The screens on early review samples of its Galaxy Fold failed, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to postpone the product. Samsung and others have since released a few more foldable phones, but none were compelling to me.
Google's entry into the market is significant. Mirroring Apple's tight control of the iPhone's design, Google designed both the hardware (including the computing processor) and software that power the Pixel Fold. That means the device's software was tailored to work with it, and it has long battery life and very fast performance.
Beyond the bigger screen, Google has come up with clever reasons for how and why you might use a foldable phone.
For one, the Pixel Fold is a great video player to use everywhere because of the way it folds at an angle like a laptop.
When I cooked in the kitchen, I played a YouTube video with a recipe and folded the device at a 90-degree angle. The upper half of the screen showed the video, and the lower half showed the description listing the ingredients. In some ways, this was even better than a tablet, which you would have to prop up with a stand on the countertop to view at the proper angle.
What else might you do with a foldable? With the device unfolded, I ran two apps side by side, which was useful for reading a webpage while typing an email.
Google also demonstrated how its translation app could take advantage of the two screens. Consider a situation in which you, an English speaker, are trying to communicate with someone who speaks Chinese. Holding the phone unfolded, you can speak English into the microphone and have the phone's outer screen show text translated into Chinese to the other person. When the Chinese speaker responds, you can read the translated text on the inner screen.
This feature will not be released until the fall, so I didn't get to test it. But it's an intriguing use case.
In the end, the device is expensive because it is packed with advanced technology with no major trade-offs. In my tests, its camera produced crisp and vibrant images on a par with photos taken with Apple's latest iPhone and the Pixel 7 Pro, Google's $ 900 smartphone, which has an excellent camera.
Though the Pixel Fold's high price will make it inaccessible to most people, it was an exciting glimpse into the next step for smartphones. Over the last five years, as phone screens got bigger, we have voted with our wallets and shown that we prefer larger screens, so long as they come on devices easy to carry everywhere. The Pixel Fold delivers that.
I suspect that in a few years, foldable phones will probably fall in price to replace current phones with the "pro" moniker and will make up the new high end of the market. When that happens, I can see myself and many others making the switch to a foldable -- and a future where the tablet becomes less relevant.

Full text: Some offer evacuations and others provide coverage for accidental death or injury to cater to the growing adventure tourism market.
The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $ 1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $ 316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. "Whether it's space or Everest, every person deserves to be found," she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.
Traditional travel insurance won't swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $ 360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises "military special operations veterans" will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $ 1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $ 3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd's of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. "But that's just the definition of their mission," Ms. Hastings argues. "We don't encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status."
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can't really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, "If there's an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people." -- Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Saudi Arabia goes shopping in Europe. Executives and government officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, blitzed Paris this week as part of a road show to attract investment and make its case to host the World Expo in 2030. The oil-rich kingdom has been on a push to diversify its economy and expand its global presence, through investments in a range of sectors including sports.
Lina Khan finally takes on Amazon. The F.T.C. chair shot to fame at the age of 29, when she wrote an academic article criticizing the tech company's dominance of large parts of the American economy. Three years later, her agency has sued Amazon over a different issue: the F.T.C. accused the company of tricking customers into signing up for Prime, its streaming and subscription shopping service.
Musk vs. Zuck? The tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have apparently agreed to a cage fight, after goading each other on social media. Mr. Musk admitted he almost never works out but the Facebook founder has recently taken up Brazilian jujitsu and competed in tournaments and endurance contests.
Prandial Peru. Central, a restaurant in Lima, was crowned the best eatery anywhere by the World's 50 Best Restaurants, one of the most prestigious lists. The venue is known for its creative approach to using domestically produced ingredients and trying to adhere to the traditions and culture of the country.
India's soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country's diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power -- and helped boost the country's image.
The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix's chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 -- at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 -- and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $ 150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $ 100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.
And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India's reputation, but "if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country."
The greatest hits of Masa Son's wild PowerPoint presentations
SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate's struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank's annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.
His presentation featured slides that asked big questions -- including "What is Mankind?" -- and the billionaire's story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it's tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook's favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as "producer of golden eggs," whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The "valley of coronavirus," a classic, shows SoftBank's winged unicorns -- that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in -- flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers "vision capital," not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies' market caps so much that those numbers ... simply couldn't be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork's fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank's profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

Exchanging Vows, and Then Partying Like It's 1979: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After years of tamped-down celebrations, some couples are embracing the glimmering, gaudy energy of the '70s, from the Dead to disco.
Beyoncé's disco-inspired "Renaissance" album. Amazon Prime's "Daisy Jones & The Six" set in the rollicking landscape of Sunset Strip in 1977. Dead & Company's final tour this summer. Bell-bottoms, maximalist design and plenty of marijuana. It can seem like the '70s are everywhere again.
And this includes weddings. "With trends, whether it's fashion or music, it always trickles down to events," said Sarah Mastriano, the owner of A Lovely Universe Events based in Red Bank, N.J. She considers the recent '70s resurgence a reaction to pandemic times when so many weddings were forced to become pared-down, or even virtual affairs.
"We were all locked up for so long that now couples are really emphasizing the experience of the guest," Ms. Mastriano said. "If they're going to come out of their house and almost put their health at risk to be in a big crowd, it better be interesting and fun."
When Hilary Katzman, 34, and Bryan Kayne, 30, both product managers who live in Manhattan, were married on May 6, the couple tasked Ms. Mastriano with creating "a love fest" for their 160 guests.
"I'm a Grateful Dead fan to the extreme," Mr. Kayne said, and they sought to bring the band's attendant culture of love and kindness to their nuptials.
Accordingly, the couple wanted their wedding to be rooted in their values of peace, sharing and vulnerability. Porta Asbury Park, a restaurant on the Jersey Shore, proved their dream venue, partly because of the giant disco ball installation over the dance floor.
In addition to a nine-piece band called Daddy Pop that played disco tunes, jazzy '70s yacht rock and the Grateful Dead, the couple incorporated nostalgia into many aspects of their wedding -- from disco ball stirrers and tables named after Grateful Dead songs to rainbow-colored attire for their 30-person "inner circle" and a tie-dye tuxedo and a silver sequined dress serving as the couple's second looks.
Michelle Angelosanto of Modern Rebel, a wedding planning company in New York City, is gearing up for a similarly themed soiree at Brooklyn Grange Sunset Park in July for Priya Mapara, 32, a digital product designer, and Luke Waring, 33, a software engineer.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn, told Ms. Angelosanto they wanted the celebration "to feel really relaxed, groovy and inclusive," she said. "That just naturally lends itself to a '70s aesthetic." For this wedding, there will be a rust red, burnt orange and lavender color palette, large and small disco balls and lounge spaces with rattan benches and rust orange velvet chairs.
Anshul and Keats Kamble called their wedding, which took place Dec. 4 at the Evergreen in Portland, Ore., "muted disco." Post-Covid, the '70s represented a break from hardship, said Ms. Kamble, 26, a business analyst at a health company, adding that disco "feels like a little escape." A big dance party was paramount.
Mr. Kamble, 28, a social media marketing strategist, honored his Mumbai roots with an ivory sherwani (a long coat) with floral embroidery at the ceremony. For the reception, "I wanted to hard launch my marriage chain," he said of the traditional gold necklace given to him by his grandparents. "So I wore a monochrome forest green suit with the chain as the main accessory." Their wedding planner, Candida Bell, lead planner of Bridal Bliss in Portland, called the suit "very John Travolta 'Saturday Night Fever."'
The bride wore a puff-sleeve gown for the ceremony and changed into a shorter dress with patent leather go-go boots.
Along with disco balls in their floral arrangements, a playlist heavy on disco originals and '70s remixes like "September" by Earth, Wind & Fire and disco ball key chains for their 120 guests, they rented a vintage phone where guests could leave them a voice message. Now, a vinyl record of these audio missives resides on their bookcase.
Nora Sheils, the founder of Bridal Bliss and a founder of wedding software company Rock Paper Coin, also in Portland, believes that nostalgia plays a big role in the '70s resurrection. A lot of couples getting married today would rather look to the past than the future, she said, noting that the '70s "super carefree" nature strikes a chord with many. She also points to '70s songs like "Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac resurfacing on TikTok. Other songs having a moment include "What You Won't Do for Love" by Bobby Caldwell and "Angie" by the Rolling Stones.
Wedding industry vendors have taken note of the craze. Minted Weddings, a design marketplace for artists and makers, reports that 10 percent of designs in its 2023 wedding collection integrate a '70s design motif; this represents a 107 percent increase from last year.
Carolyn Doogan, an owner of Baumbirdy in Chicago, which sells its paper goods on the platform, has found much inspiration in the time period, saying "brides today want to create that mood for their guests, like a visual filter for their day."
Ms. Mastriano sees this trend as a "return to letting loose, having a little sparkle in your life. People are telling me 'I want my wedding to feel like a healthier version of Studio 54."'

Full text: A federal judge is deciding whether Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard can move forward. If it can, it would be the largest consumer technology deal in decades. If the judge delays the deal, Microsoft's lead lawyer said, the company may abandon it.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft last year to block the deal through an in-house court, arguing that the acquisition would harm competition by bringing together Microsoft's Xbox console and game streaming service with Activision's popular games, like Call of Duty. This month, the agency filed another suit in federal court, asking a judge to prevent the deal from going forward before the F.T.C. has the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
Microsoft says the Activision deal would be good for consumers, allowing them to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, for example.
The company wants to close the transaction by July 18. If the federal judge sides with the F.T.C. and sends the case to the in-house court, Microsoft's lead lawyers said, that will set off a "three-year administrative nightmare" that will sink the deal.
The clash is just the latest chapter in the F.T.C.'s campaign to curb the power of big tech companies. Under Lina Khan, its chair, the agency has sued Meta, Facebook's parent company, and Amazon over issues related to competition and consumer protections. These legal challenges haven't always been successful -- and the suit against Microsoft will be another test of the F.T.C.'s ability to deliver on its mandate.
"As you get closer to your destination, as you try to find that destination, you slow down even further."
Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, discussing the central bank's plans to continue raising interest rates but at a more moderate pace.
"It's going to quickly reverse all the progress that was made during the repayment pause."

"You can interrupt each other without being rude when you're in person. In a Zoom conversation, you have to let somebody finish their thought."

Hot Pink Moves Into Interior Design in a Bold Way: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Barbiecore, a palette made up primarily of hot pink, is surging its way into home décor, sparked by the upcoming movie and maximalism.
Amanda Hansen loves a hot pink moment. "I think I just naturally am such a pink froufrou girl. All my stuff. Everything I buy is always a little bit Barbie-esque," she said. "So it has taken over."
Ms. Hansen, a graphic designer in Tacoma, Wash., infused her home with colors fit for Barbie's Dreamhouse, from pink Smeg appliances in the kitchen to purple and pink floral wallpaper in the dining room and tons of colorful accents in between. The pièce de résistance, though, is the backyard Barbie oasis. There, Ms. Hansen, 31, installed a hot pink aboveground pool, which she purchased on Amazon for about $ 150, and shaded it with a banana leaf print umbrella. She painted a pink and white checkered floor on the concrete patio and, soon, a pink cabana with a striped curtain will round off the space.
"I wanted to make it that Palm Springs feel with all pink, just as Barbie as I can get it to look, like it's not a little backyard here in Tacoma," said Ms. Hansen. Barbiecore, a palette made up primarily of hot pink, and similarly bold rosy hues like fuchsia and magenta, is surging its way into home décor with the forthcoming release of the "Barbie" movie serving as a catalyst.
Information shared by Pinterest, the web service where people can save images to virtual pinboards, shows that there was a 1,135 percent increase in searches for "Barbie aesthetic bedroom" from May 2022 to May 2023. The web service also saw an increase in other searches for hot pink décor including bathroom décor and kitchen cabinets, said Swasti Sarna, Pinterest's global director of data insights.
Simply wearing hot pink isn't enough, people want to be surrounded by it at home, too.
Hot pink fits right into maximalism, which experienced a resurgence in recent years as a response to the cool minimalist aesthetic that dominated Instagram feeds for so long. During the pandemic, people leaned into their personal styles at home, disco balls to handmade tiles.
When Ms. Hansen married her husband six years ago, she gave farmhouse décor a try. "It wasn't my style, and I realized that, but I was trying to be mature," she said. "So it just kind of started happening one day and I think it was probably three or four years ago and I started painting the walls and it just has escalated."
In Nashville, Beverly Griffith always loved the color and incorporated it into her home décor when she bought her house in 2017. "Millennial pink isn't nearly pink enough for me," said Ms. Griffith, 42. Her bathroom, for example, has a hot pink shower curtain and pink tub and the recently renovated kitchen has hot pink appliances, which Ms. Griffith painted herself.
At the start of the pandemic, when she left her job as a bartender, Ms. Griffith brought that affinity for hot pink to her home's exterior, too, by painting it in three different vibrant hues. The house became a social media sensation and now she rents it out to musicians and content creators who use the space for the day. "Since I've painted my house pink, I've met people or read comments on social media, saying that they've been embarrassed to say they like pink in the past," said Ms. Griffith. "They've thanked me for being so outwardly and confidently pink."
Pink is often thought of as a feminine color, but that wasn't always the case. According to Color Psychology, pink was originally worn by boys because it was a paler version of the red used in military uniforms. Eventually, pink was rebranded as a girl's color. Hot pink made waves when Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli released her own iteration, called "Shocking pink," in the mid-1930s.
The original Barbie doll didn't even wear pink when it first debuted in 1959, wearing, instead, a black and white chevron bathing suit. "The world truly made the pink connection with Barbie in the '70s when we started consistently leaning into predominantly pink packaging as a core brand identifier," said Kim Culmone, senior vice president and head of Barbie and fashion doll design for Mattel. Barbie's pink shades evolved over the years, and in 2008 the vibrant "Barbie Pink" became an official Pantone color.
With Barbie in the air, brands are seizing the moment. Following last year's collaboration with Mattel to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Barbie Dreamhouse, the furniture company Joybird is partnering with the toymaker on another collection that includes sofas and accent chairs in a deep jewel pink tone set to release in July.
Gifty Walker, Joybird's director of merchandising and sourcing in Los Angeles, noted that Joybird had a hot pink couch that was popular in 2016. Now hot pink is back and customers are using it to eschew traditional neutrals like grays, browns, and tans. "Once, those bolder colors were reserved for pillows and rugs and just the décor accents, and now we see people really making them an anchor piece in the room," said Ms. Walker.
For Jasmine Mitchell, a 30-year-old model, decorating with hot pink allowed her to connect with her inner child. When she moved from Dallas to Los Angeles in 2021 she designed her living room around the color. The first item she purchased for her apartment's living room was a velvet hot pink accent chair with gold legs. LED lights surrounding the windows cast a pink glow in the evening.
"I like the other pinks, but hot pink just does something. It's electrifying. It makes me so happy and makes me feel alive," Ms. Mitchell said. "So I kind of let my younger self guide me." Beverly Griffith painted her Nashville house, built in 1915, three shades of pink at the start of the pandemic. Below, from left: colors like Ken by Eaton House Studios and In the Pink by Sherwin-Williams give Ms. Griffith's kitchen a Barbiecore boost; and Ms. Griffith's primary bathroom is replete with tile, a tub and a shower curtain in vibrant rosy hues.

Full text: True believers in the immersive audio format say it could restore a musical appreciation lost to a generation that has come up during the streaming era.
After more than 30 years as a producer and engineer, Brad Wood wasn't sure if he still had a future in music.
Wood, a classically trained saxophonist, had gotten his start in Chicago's early '90s music scene, helming breakthrough albums for Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, and platinum records for Smashing Pumpkins and Placebo. In 2000, he moved to Southern California, where he thrived for a time -- and then merely survived, as the downloading era sank recording budgets just as the brand of guitar rock he specialized in lost cultural relevancy.
While many of his colleagues gave up, Wood kept going, working harder while earning less. "I probably got to the point where I was making the same rate as when I started," he said.
Then, in 2021, an emergent technology ushered Wood -- and thousands of recording professionals like him -- into an unexpected boom time.
Over the past two years, Wood has been busy mixing old and new records in Dolby Atmos, an audio format that lets engineers create a listening experience more immersive than traditional stereo by placing sounds around and above the listener. Working for a variety of labels, Wood has done Atmos mixes for the Supremes, the Pogues, Jennifer Lopez, Modest Mouse, Gwen Stefani and Soul Asylum -- some 300-plus tracks in total, the equivalent of two dozen albums.
"The whole thing has been pretty unexpected and thrilling," he said.
For Dolby, the audio company that developed Atmos, and Apple Music -- which has invested heavily in it -- the technology could lead to the most dramatic shift in audio in 65 years.
"The recording industry went from mono to stereo decades ago, and it didn't move from there," John Couling, senior vice president of Dolby Laboratories, said in a phone interview.
There have been efforts to convince the public to adopt new advanced technologies in the years since, ‌including Quadraphonic sound in the '70s ‌and 5.1 surround sound in the '90s, but with little success. "We've changed formats, we've changed delivery methods, we've changed all sorts of things," Couling said, "but it was still fundamentally the same sound. Atmos is a completely new experience."
Oliver Schusser, a vice president at Apple Music, said that his company, which has incentivized record labels to deliver catalog material in Atmos, sees it as a way to bring sonic value back to music -- something that's been lost among a whole generation that has come up during the streaming era.
"There was no appreciation of the art and work of sound engineers and mixing and mastering," Schusser said over a video call this spring. "That really pained us. We wanted to fix that."
Today, all three major record labels and hundreds of independents are delivering tracks in Atmos. Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal and QQ Music are among the 15 streaming services bringing Atmos to 160 countries and over 500 million listeners.
"But mention the word 'Atmos' to anyone in the general public and they don't know what the hell you're talking about," said the veteran engineer and producer Bob Clearmountain. One of the most respected and influential figures in the recording world, Clearmountain was initially dubious of Atmos's staying power, but he has come to believe in its future.
"Music has become background noise for most people. It's something in your headphones while you're out doing other stuff," he said during a call last month. "When I was a teenager, I used to listen to an album three, four times through just sitting in front of my speakers, entranced." That way of listening has disappeared, he said, but he's hopeful that Atmos can bring it back, "if we're able to get people to understand what it is and hear it the right way."
From the outside, it appears Atmos is entering a critical period that could determine whether it will kick off a sonic revolution or become just another tech lost to time.
DOLBY ATMOS, INTRODUCED in 2012, was initially developed for movie theaters and the home theater market. Because it offers a wider palette than stereo, and differs from traditional 5.1 and 7.1 channel setups, Atmos allows engineers -- typically mixing across a dozen or more speakers -- to put sound sources in front, to the side, behind and even above the listener.
"When you take sounds and you separate them from each other," Couling said, "you will be able to hear those sounds independently much more clearly than if they are on top of each other. By creating space, we also create depth and clarity -- and we found that's what content creators really wanted."
For artists like Chic's founder, Nile Rodgers, immersive audio is the closest thing to the musician's experience. "When I'm making a record, I'm sitting in a room with the band," Rodgers said during a video chat, "we're playing and jamming and what happens is the sound is bathing us. That's what music sounds like to me."
Listening to Dolby Atmos mixes in a professional recording studio can be a powerful experience. "It's remarkably seductive," said Clearmountain, who's done Atmos projects for Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and others. "I've played Atmos tracks for so many people who say, 'I can never listen to stereo again.' People have been in tears, moved by what they were hearing. It has an incredible effect."
Opinions among recording professionals on any subject are rarely uniform, and there are some who have reservations about Atmos.
Susan Rogers, a longtime engineer for Prince, left the music industry in the late '90s to become a cognitive neuroscientist. Last fall, Dolby invited her to the company headquarters in San Francisco to listen to a new Atmos mix of Prince's "When Doves Cry," a track she originally worked on.
"As both an engineer and as a psychoacoustician, I have mixed feelings about whether it's an improvement," Rogers said in a phone interview.
She noted that there are evolutionary and biological reasons that sound sources coming from behind and above listeners can be unsettling or anxiety inducing. She also observed that music is a potent form of communication in large part because the consummatory phase happens entirely in the listener's head. Having clearer and more sound sources can actually make it harder to know what to pay attention to.
"That was what I noticed listening to 'When Doves Cry' in Atmos," Rogers said. "It sounded amazing, but it was more difficult to assemble it into a unified whole in that private place I listen to music. I found it distracting." Her "knee-jerk reaction was 'do not want,"' she said. "But over time I may learn to like it."
APPLE MUSIC IS betting heavily that the public will, by and large, come to love Atmos. Although other companies, including Amazon, had flirted with the technology, in 2021 Apple decided to commit itself fully to Atmos, putting its own proprietary and branding spin on the tech, dubbing it "spatial" audio.
Strategically, Atmos offers Apple Music a way to further distinguish itself from streaming competitors like Spotify -- which has historically ignored high resolution or advanced audio options -- and siphon market share from the industry's dominant music service, YouTube.
"We wanted something where people would notice a difference immediately," said Schusser, the Apple Music executive. "Maybe not 100 percent would love Atmos or spatial audio right away, but everyone would know this sounds different, and the hope is the majority would come to appreciate the upgrade."
Initially, Apple's biggest challenge was that there was very little Atmos content available. In 2017, R.E.M.'s "Automatic for the People" became the first album mixed for Atmos, and over the next few years, several notable Atmos releases -- from Elton John, Queen and the Beatles -- showcased the format's possibilities.
To achieve its broader aims, Apple needed to make Atmos content both viable and plentiful. It began by partnering with Dolby to encourage recording studios to upgrade to the format. There are now some 800 officially recognized Dolby Atmos studios in over 40 countries, a 350 percent increase in just two years. (Dolby estimates there are two or three times that number of other studios capable of delivering music in Atmos.)
Apple Music also drew up wish lists of artists, albums and tracks and presented them to record labels, along with funding and deadlines, to help quickly expand the library of titles available in Atmos. Over the past few years, this effort to refit 50 years of pop music has heralded a rush of work for engineers and mixers, who've suddenly found themselves doing volume business in the format.
Wood, initially dismissive of learning to work in Atmos, said he changed his mind once he realized the inevitability of its rise. "It was clear that records I'd made were going to get mixed in Atmos," he said, "and if I didn't learn how to do it, somebody else would, and I'd be ceding that control." Wood's first Atmos mix was for Liz Phair's "Soberish," an album he'd originally produced. "And, also, I realized there would be a good payday in learning," he added.
While contemporary pop and hip-hop artists were quick to adopt the format for new releases, convincing veteran rock acts to enter the Atmos fray proved more of a challenge. "The first six months, those artists had a lot of questions," Schusser said.
Some groups, like the Doors, embraced the format, overhauling their entire catalog in Atmos all at once; others, like Fleetwood Mac, have proceeded more cautiously, doing one album at a time. More and more though, top legacy artists have been putting out Atmos mixes with increasing regularity, with recent releases including landmark albums like Pink Floyd's‌ ‌"The Dark Side of the Moon‌‌" and ‌the Beach Boys'‌ ‌"Pet Sounds."
Given the sheer volume of Atmos catalog work and the still evolving understanding of the format, not all mixes are created equal.
"The labels seem to be farming this stuff out and it isn't always being done with the original artist or production team involved," Clearmountain said. "I know that's not always possible. But sometimes what comes back are just bad mixes -- or strange mixes, anyway."
Wood -- who has done mixes in consultation with the original artists as well as on his own -- agrees. "In general, you have to try to put the tracks into a speaker array so it doesn't sound too jarring or gimmicky," he said. "The goal is to feel like you're sitting amongst these musicians as they're performing. Like all mixing, it's subjective, and how you approach it really depends on the music itself."
For some artists, transforming old recordings into Atmos has been challenging. Chic recently had its first three albums mixed in the format. "The process took months and months to get right," Rodgers said. "The team that was working on it, we gave them notes, we went into different rooms, did rough mixes to show them what we were talking about."
For others, the overhaul has been relatively painless and even eye-opening. This past spring, Alicia Keys had eight of her albums mixed for Atmos. In a video interview promoting her catalog overhaul, Keys said that engineers working on her albums "completely reimagined every note, every sound, every instrument, every voice. It sounds like you've never heard it before. I mean, I never even heard it like this before. It really is a new experience."
ONE OF THE reasons other highly touted surround sound technologies like 5.1 and 7.1 failed to catch on is because they required a specific speaker configuration. Dolby Atmos, however, is scalable and can adapt to a variety of setups.
Given its success in the headphones market, Apple has emphasized playback on its AirPods and Beats Fit Pro devices, which all offer a version of the Atmos experience with dynamic head tracking (where the sound shifts along with a user's movement) in the $ 200 to $ 500 range. A number of other manufacturers, including Audeze, RIG, Corsair and LG, also offer Atmos headphones and earbuds.
The options for affordable home music systems, ones purpose-built for Atmos audio, have been limited. Amazon and Apple have long offered their own Atmos-enabled smart speakers, but neither really conveyed the full range of sound possible.
In March, Sonos introduced a first of its kind sub- $ 500 speaker, the Era 300, which more successfully packages the Atmos experience into a single compact unit, equipped with a half-dozen drivers that direct sound left, right, forward and upward.
The Grammy-winning mixing and mastering engineer Emily Lazar, who helped test and fine tune the Era 300, hopes it will be the start of tech companies bringing more viable Atmos options to market.
"No one who's listened to Atmos in a properly tuned, beautiful-sounding studio can deny what it offers," she said. "How now can we deliver that in a smaller package so everybody can afford it and have that same kind of experience is going to be key moving forward."
If Atmos does ever achieve critical mass, it might come through automobiles. Most cars come equipped standard with a dozen-plus speakers, making them a natural environment for immersive audio. So far, a handful of major automakers including Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have introduced plans to put Atmos in their vehicles. It's a market Dolby and Apple both say they are determined to expand further.
"But those kind of tech changes don't happen in a year or two -- and that's really what it's been so far," Schusser said. "There's obviously more work to be done. But we're all optimistic we'll get there with Atmos."
In the meantime, recording pros like Wood will keep working and mixing, hoping the Atmos bump will last a little while longer.
"I don't know that I could have written a better chapter for this phase of my career," he said. "If you told me three years ago, I was going to get paid my day rate to listen and work on some of the greatest recordings in history, I would've said, 'Sign me up -- that sounds amazing."'

After more than 30 years as a producer and engineer, Brad Wood wasn’t sure if he still had a future in music.
Wood, a classically trained saxophonist, had gotten his start in Chicago’s early ’90s music scene, helming breakthrough albums for Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, and platinum records for Smashing Pumpkins and Placebo. In 2000, he moved to Southern California, where he thrived for a time — and then merely survived, as the downloading era sank recording budgets just as the brand of guitar rock he specialized in lost cultural relevancy.
While many of his colleagues gave up, Wood kept going, working harder while earning less. “I probably got to the point where I was making the same rate as when I started,” he said.
Then, in 2021, an emergent technology ushered Wood — and thousands of recording professionals like him — into an unexpected boom time.
Over the past two years, Wood has been busy mixing old and new records in Dolby Atmos, an audio format that lets engineers create a listening experience more immersive than traditional stereo by placing sounds around and above the listener.

Cloud Giants From China Worry U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration is exploring whether it can mount a campaign against Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei, potentially fueling tensions with Beijing.
In the digital cold war between the United States and China, American officials are increasingly turning their attention to a new target: Chinese cloud computing giants.
Over the last 18 months, the Biden administration and members of Congress have ramped up their exploration of what can be done to address security concerns about the cloud computing divisions of Chinese tech behemoths like Alibaba and Huawei, five people with knowledge of the matter said.
American officials have discussed whether they can set tighter rules for the Chinese companies when they operate in the United States, as well as ways to counter the companies' growth abroad, three of the people said. The Biden administration has also spoken with the American cloud computing companies Google, Microsoft and Amazon to understand how their Chinese competitors operate, three other people with knowledge of the matter said.
By focusing on the Chinese cloud companies, U.S. officials are potentially widening the scope of the technological tensions between Washington and Beijing. In recent years, the United States has choked China's access to crucial technologies while trying to limit the reach of Chinese tech and telecommunication companies abroad.
Former President Donald J. Trump directed his administration toward hindering Chinese telecom equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE from playing a role in next-generation 5G wireless networks. The Trump administration also targeted Chinese-owned apps like TikTok and Grindr, forcing the sale of the latter, and began working to restrict Chinese involvement in undersea internet cables. President Biden has continued some of these efforts.
Cloud computing companies, which operate vast data centers that provide computing power and software to businesses, would become a new technological front just as China has pushed back on the U.S. roadblocks. On Monday, Wang Yi, China's top foreign affairs official, told Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken that the United States needed to stop interfering with China's technological development.
But American officials fear that Beijing could use Chinese data centers in the United States and abroad to gain access to sensitive data, echoing concerns about Chinese telecom gear and TikTok. Cloud computing is a crucial behind-the-scenes engine of the digital economy, enabling services like video streaming and allowing companies to run artificial intelligence programs.
A White House spokesman declined to comment. Huawei did not offer a comment, while Alibaba and Tencent, another Chinese tech giant with a cloud division, did not respond to requests for comment. Google, Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment.
Samm Sacks, a cyber policy fellow at the New America think tank, said the interest in cloud computing reflected the Biden administration's approach of looking at Chinese influence in the infrastructure of the internet and the digital services that use the web.
"There's an intent to focus on the whole ecosystem across those layers," she said.
U.S. efforts to hinder Chinese tech firms have had mixed success. American restrictions on suppliers to Huawei hurt the company's smartphone business, but efforts to remove Huawei equipment from wireless networks inside the United States continue. The Trump administration forced Grindr's Chinese owners to sell the app, while efforts to push the Chinese internet giant ByteDance to divest TikTok have been unsuccessful.
The global cloud computing market is substantial, with total public cloud revenues of $ 544 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group. In the United States, Chinese companies account for a tiny fraction of the cloud market, despite having data centers in Silicon Valley and Virginia, said John Dinsdale, the chief analyst at Synergy.
But Chinese cloud companies are making inroads in Asia and Latin America. Huawei's chairman said last year that his company had seen "rapid growth" in its cloud business. In May, Huawei hosted a cloud conference in Indonesia. Alibaba convened a gathering in Mexico last year to promote its cloud products.
Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement that he was concerned that while the Federal Communications Commission could bar some Chinese companies from providing telecom services in the United States, those firms had "still been able to offer services like cloud computing." Mr. Warner wrote legislation that would give the White House more power to police Chinese technology.
In April, nine Republican senators wrote to a group of administration officials encouraging them to investigate and penalize Chinese cloud companies that they said posed a threat to national security, including Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu.
"We urge you to use all available tools to engage in decisive action against these firms," they said.
The Commerce and State Departments have been considering how to handle the Chinese cloud computing companies, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Commerce Department has looked at creating tighter rules that would govern the Chinese cloud providers, two of the people said. It could create the rules under a new legal authority that allows it to restrict technologies that could pose a threat to national security.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department declined to comment.
The State Department has also started developing a strategy for raising American concerns about Chinese cloud computing providers with other countries, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The agency has already quietly brought the topic up in conversations with foreign governments, which can help diplomats understand what messages work best, one of the people said.
As many Chinese companies benefit from major government subsidies, experts fear that the Chinese cloud computing providers might be able to offer contracts below the rates of their American competitors. The U.S. government could find a way to offer foreign assistance of its own or urge American cloud providers to provide benefits to customers, like free training, to counter the Chinese companies' inducements.
A State Department spokesman said it was critical for every aspect of the global internet -- including data centers -- to be powered by trustworthy equipment. The spokesman added that the agency was also focused on reducing risks associated with wireless equipment, undersea telecom cables and satellites.

Microsoft Could Abandon Its Deal With Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A five-day hearing over Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition, which the Federal Trade Commission hopes to block, began Thursday in federal court.
The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal's closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
"This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward," said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft's lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a "three-year administrative nightmare" that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision -- and its popular games like Call of Duty -- would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
"If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud," James Weingarten, the F.T.C.'s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft's $ 7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision's games into Microsoft's portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty -- an enormous franchise that has earned more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.
Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game's revenue. She said Sony had become the "complainer in chief" in the case, and showed an email from Sony's chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft's bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley's courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.
Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition.

Full text: A spaceship lands near a small town in the Amazon, leaving the local government to manage an alien invasion. Dissidents who disappeared during a military dictatorship return years later as zombies. Bodies suddenly begin to fuse upon physical contact, forcing Colombians to navigate newly dangerous salsa bars and FARC guerrillas who have merged with tropical birds.
Across Latin America, shelves labeled "ciencia ficción," or science fiction, have long been filled with translations of H.P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, William Gibson and H.G. Wells. Now they might have to compete with a new wave of Latin American writers who are making the genre their own, rerooting it in their homelands and histories. Shrugging off rolling cornfields and New York skylines, they set their stories against the dense Amazon, craggy Andean mountainscapes and unmistakably Latin American urban sprawl.

Murky Frontier of Rules For the Space Industry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Estimated to be worth about $ 460 billion, space businesses sometimes operate in legal black holes.
Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are racing to establish a presence in space. But what rights and obligations come with that?
It's not clear what the rules are, even as the $ 460 billion space industry is growing quickly.
Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Mr. Branson, announced on Thursday that it would launch its first commercial spaceflight this month, joining Mr. Bezos' Blue Origin, and Mr. Musk's SpaceX in sending ticketed passengers to space. But travel is just one emerging corner of the industry, which is mostly fueled by U.S. and international government contracts. The sector includes companies in the fields of satellites and communications, solar power, manufacturing, and even mining. One, Orbital Assembly, hopes to open a luxury extraterrestrial hotel by 2025.
Citigroup analysts project that space businesses will reach a trillion dollars in revenue by 2040.
All this activity raises legal questions.
In theory, space belongs to everyone. In 1967, as the United States and the Soviet Union were building up their nuclear arsenals, the United Nations signed a treaty that says no country can claim territory in space. "We didn't want to bring the Cold War into space," Michelle Hanlon, co-director of the air and space law program at the University of Mississippi, told DealBook.
Since then, a U.N. space committee has made four more treaties and five sets of principles covering areas like arms control and liability for damage caused by space objects. All are premised on the notion that space "should be devoted to enhancing the well-being of all countries and humankind, with an emphasis on promoting international cooperation."
That perspective is about to collide with reality, said Curt Blake, a space lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and the former C.E.O. of a space start-up. "Humans have done such a bad job regulating anything of common good, like the oceans and air," he said. "Are we going to be better at caring for the moon?"
One upcoming test is a race between China and the United States to get to the poles of the moon to mine water, which could make it possible to produce fuel in space. There is little understanding of what will happen when they both get there.
"Will they live on separate sides or dot their bases?" Ms. Hanlon asked. "We don't know because we have these regulatory gaps."
Another potential conflict is brewing over 170 million pieces of debris like satellites abandoned in the Earth's orbit, known as "space trash," because their accumulation makes exploration more difficult and dangerous. Since nobody owns space, it isn't always clear whose responsibility it is to clean it up. In September, the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules ordering companies to take down nonfunctioning satellites within five years, down from 25 years.
Lawyers are wrestling with these sorts of issues at gatherings like The Hague Space Diplomacy Symposium this week at the Leiden University in the Netherlands, which focused on cooperation amid rising geopolitical tensions and competition.
The U.S. government has deliberately left some holes. In 2004, Congress imposed a moratorium on safety regulations for commercial space launches, essentially a free pass, or "learning period," that is set to expire in October. It has lasted so long because there hasn't been enough development to base new rules on. In April, a report from the RAND Corporation recommended against extending again, and the Federal Aviation Administration is planning more oversight.
Business leaders caution against creating so much regulation that it pushes innovation offshore while recognizing that we need rules. And futurists naturally have a long and expansive view. Many are concerned that we'll exploit resources in space before we're able to "access the infinity of the universe," as Ms. Hanlon put it.
"We just need to hold it together for 200 years," she said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
The Fed takes a breather. At Wednesday's meeting, the central bank kept interest rates unchanged for the first time in more than a year. But officials suggested that rates would rise more in 2023, as inflation remains "well above" the Federal Reserve's target.
JPMorgan settles. The bank secured a potential $ 290 million deal with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's victims, who claimed that the bank had overlooked red flags in his activity because it valued him as a wealthy client. JPMorgan Chase still faces a related lawsuit by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Bill Gates meets Xi Jinping in Beijing. The Microsoft co-founder is one of the first prominent U.S. business leaders to meet the Chinese leader since the start of the pandemic. Their talks preceded a visit by Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, to China.
Bud Slight. Modelo Especial replaced Bud Light as the best-selling in America, after a boycott by consumers over a promotional post by a transgender influencer. The controversy has spotlighted the challenges that brands and retailers like Adidas and Target have faced in marketing to L.G.B.T.Q. consumers in a polarized political environment.
Michael Jordan nets a big profit. The investors Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall reportedly bought his majority stake in the National Basketball Association's Charlotte Hornets for $ 3 billion. Jordan acquired the team in 2010 for $ 275 million and will retain a minority stake.
Companies may not know when employees use A.I.
Companies including Accenture, PwC and Morgan Stanley announced big initiatives to get their employees to use generative A.I. tools like chatbots and image generators. But even at companies that haven't introduced these tools, many workers are using them -- and they may not be mentioning it.
In a survey of 4,491 white-collar workers by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, 39 percent of those who use generative A.I. tools said they had done so without their employer's knowledge in the last three months.
There are risks if workers use these tools without training, including that they will share private company data or not understand that A.I. tools can produce inaccurate work. (See: the lawyer who ended up citing made-up court cases in a legal brief.)
But there may also be potential. In a report this week, McKinsey estimated that generative A.I. could add $ 2.6 trillion to $ 4.4 trillion to the global economy. The research looked at 63 use cases for generative A.I. across 850 occupations, finding that 60 to 70 percent of all work tasks could be automated by currently available technology.
"Employee interest, especially amongst the younger generations, is likely ahead of many of their managers," said Ana Kreacic, the chief operating officer of Oliver Wyman's think tank, in an email to DealBook. "Some organizations are leading and some are catching up, but it takes time for best practices to evolve across different industries."
9.7 percent
-- How much consumer prices in Sweden rose last month. One potential contributing factor? Beyoncé kicked off her world tour in Stockholm, and fans who flocked to the city to see the singer pushed up the prices for hotel rooms and restaurant meals, according to Sweden's statistics agency.
On our radar: 'Winner Sells All'
Walmart and Amazon's battle to dominate retail has been an epic corporate fight. In "Winner Sells All," which publishes on Tuesday, the business journalist Jason Del Rey chronicles the clash, with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, in illustrative detail. Mr. Del Rey has covered e-commerce for more than 10 years, and many of Amazon's and Walmart's top executives agreed to interviews for the book, as did their workers. Kirkus Reviews called it "an eye-opening look at a battle of corporate titans."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the big day, my wife gamely brought home a No. 1 Dad mug, which I sometimes drink coffee out of, and a No. 1 Dad T-shirt, which I sometimes sleep in, and a No. 1 Dad grilling spatula, which can be used to brand hamburgers and tuna steaks. This all made for a well-received Instagram post. But to be honest, it didn't really make me feel like a dad, let alone the No. 1 dad. Instead, I felt like a guy whose response to a major life milestone was to hide inside a bit.
When I think about my stepfather, who raised me, I think about the way he wielded his grill tongs, padding around the deck in his tapioca-colored apron, as if it were the most natural act in the world. Or the way he turned down the volume on the national television broadcast of N.F.L. games in favor of the local radio announcers, who "weren't idiots." Or the way he sought out a maritime museum anywhere we went on family vacation. I'm now a father of two with three years of experience, but if I tried any of those things today, I would hear a little voice in my head, saying, "Look at the big dad man, dadding it up for his family!"
"Irony has seeped into the felt of any fedora that I have ever owned -- not out of any wish of mine, but out of necessity," the essayist George W.S. Trow wrote in 1980 of his father's beloved headwear. "A fedora hat worn by me without the necessary protective irony would eat through my head and kill me."
So many of the signifiers that spring to mind when we think about dads are like this: Dated or goofy or vestigial or naïve. Take the riding lawn mower, a relic from a time before climate change made us cringe at the smell of burning gas. Or the Playboy stash, an anachronism of print culture. Or the mechanical wristwatch, an antique you can't even use to order pizza.
After three years of diaper blowouts and day-care-spawned plagues (Ever heard of something called "pleurisy"? Neither had I), I've come to see the old dad ways a little more sympathetically, and with some measure of recognition. After all, our dads were responding to the same essential dad conflict we are: the tension between giving your life over to the needs of your family and keeping enough mental space for yourself to stay sane. In that context, the rider mower makes brilliant sense. It's alone time ("What? Honey? I can't hear you! This thing's loud, huh!") that accomplishes a putatively necessary domestic task.
Still, the touchstones of Boomer dad culture have outlived their descriptive usefulness for younger generations. What, we might ask, is dad culture in 2023? Does it even exist?
Over the past month, I've reached out to dozens of millennial fathers -- friends, colleagues, perfect strangers -- to help me conduct a bit of qualitative research into the customs of the newish American dad.
I asked them what are the clothes, appliances, skills, movies, TV shows, books, video games, opinions, conversations and habits of mind that define being a dad today?
The warmth and eagerness with which they responded, often at great length and featuring Talmudic levels of nuance, suggests it's a question many of us have been mulling, privately, for quite some time.
Behind that enthusiasm, I think, is a real desire for many fathers to better define the social role they've taken on. One that has been deeply, if nebulously, changed by our evolving understanding of masculinity and who is responsible for household labor. What is the right balance between provider and caregiver? What is the amount of dumb bro stuff that can be retained? What positively distinguishes fatherhood from motherhood -- and why do even the more gender-enlightened, egalitarian among us still seem to want that identity to feel distinct?
Looking at the list as a whole, a few patterns emerge. The first is that technology and convenience have rendered optional many of the stereotypically analog dad skills of yore: Navigating, oil changing -- things of that nature. Our shows of skill are more likely to occur deep within a set of nested digital menus.
Or instead, we might demonstrate our authority through displays of taste. The millennial dad, who has spent his young adulthood becoming a sophisticated consumer, has had to negotiate a place for all this miscellaneous expertise in his family life. (Doing so can be complicated. There is no entry for coffee in the canon; those surveyed were split between dads who favored ever more complicated coffee setups and those who have made a brave -- and highly symbolic -- break with their Hario V60 in favor of a cavernous Mr. Coffee.)
Finally, the new dad culture has definitely not found it necessary to put away childish things. Fantasy football, old video games, Star Wars -- dads are finding ways to preserve the pleasures of boyhood.
There's an argument to be made that the millennial father is trapped in an eternal adolescence. But that doesn't feel right, at least to me, and certainly not to my knees, which feel every day of 38 years old. I happen to think the new dad culture reflects something positive, and even sweet: that the American father is expected, rightly, to share more of himself -- his time, his feelings, and even his most childish hobbies -- with his family.
That's why we have strong opinions about children's television and baby hiking carriers: We're trying our best at this thing. This thing, which lasts a lifetime and doesn't even come with an instruction manual. Can you believe it?

Full text: For Rocky Bucano, who fell for the music after buying a Salt-N-Pepa CD in 1986, his work in the Bronx "doesn't feel like work."
The Universal Hip Hop Museum, which will be part of Bronx Point, a new mixed-use development with affordable housing in the South Bronx, is not scheduled to open until 2025. But that hasn't stopped Rocky Bucano, the museum's executive director, from celebrating hip-hop's 50th anniversary this year.
"[R]Evolution of Hip Hop," an exhibition tracing the genre's momentum from 1986 to 1990, will offer free admission this August in honor of the anniversary. The show is running through September at the nonprofit's temporary headquarters in the Bronx Terminal Market.
Mr. Bucano, 63, lives in the Clason Point section of the Bronx with his wife, Kim, 62, who recently retired as a public-school teacher, and the younger of their two sons, Kylerr, 31. Rounding out the household are Tangy, the family's Bichon Frisé mix, and Toby, a former stray cat.
6 IN THE MORNIN' I get up around 6 or 7 a.m. and open up my Microsoft Surface Duo 2. I scroll through emails and read the Sunday edition of The Times. I do this in bed very quietly. I'm trying not to wake my wife up.
THE MESSAGE Around 8 or 10 o'clock, we normally order pancakes and scrambled eggs and maybe some corned beef hash from the Crosstown Diner. We have our breakfast watching the Sunday news. I like the political talk shows, like "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." My wife watches Channel 12, which has news on the Bronx, religiously. After that, we try to get our spiritual vibe on by watching Joel Osteen.
IN DA CLUB The exhibit at the Bronx Terminal Market opens at 1 p.m. My son Kylerr and I usually jump in the car and shoot over there. He oversees social media for the museum and is a docent. Most of the time, I'm there all afternoon. I'm meeting with people -- our visitors, our guests. Sometimes I'm working with the people who work at the museum, making sure everything is tight in terms of telling the stories of the different artifacts people are looking at. Sometimes I'll jump on the turntables if I feel like playing music.
SUPA DUPA FLY On Sundays we have a visiting D.J., Cutman LG. He's part of our team and he's always playing great music: James Brown and a lot of classic hip-hop like Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa. When people come in, not only do they see objects about the great golden era of hip-hop, they actually feel it and experience what the music was like.
PEOPLE EVERYDAY Being here on a Sunday is work, but it doesn't feel like work. I've been a part of this project from the beginning, since we first started looking for locations in 2014. It's part of my DNA now. It's who I am. And I enjoy meeting people from different parts of the country and different parts of the world and learning what their connection to hip-hop is. Each person has a unique story about how they fell in love with it. Sometimes it's the first record they bought, sometimes it's a Run-DMC concert they went to in 1986. I remember when I bought my first Salt-N-Pepa CD. That's what got me involved in loving the music.
ROCK BOX People from Europe come over here because they're true fans of classic hip-hop and they want to relive the earliest years. On weekdays, we have teachers bringing their students. Kids come in, and many have never seen a cassette player or a vinyl. They don't know what a boom box is. We have a huge boom box, and when they see it they're like, "What is that? Why do they call it a boom box?" So it's just a lot of feel-good moments for me. I see people smiling and doing their selfies.
IT'S TRICKY When I began this journey, I wasn't really astute in what's called "the museum experience." I've been learning on the job. The first exhibit was bare-bones. The second one we fine-tuned, made it a better experience in terms of how it was curated. And now, with this third exhibit, I think we've knocked it out of the park. It's the most immersive, the most entertaining, the most informative. I would say the number one thing people like right now is the Dapper Dan Lounge, where we have a couple of his original jackets, or the D.J. booth.
PUSH IT! When I get home, I might go to the gym in our community's clubhouse and lift some weights, or sometimes I'll walk down to the water. One of the ferry stops is not too far from where we live, so I'll go down there and stand by the water and enjoy the sights. It's a way of putting everything in perspective for me.
RAPPER'S DELIGHT For dinner on Sundays we like to order turkey wings from a soul food restaurant. We'll also get collard greens, and for my son, mac and cheese. I can't eat that stuff, but I love sweet potatoes. After dinner I'm normally on my computer, emailing, sending notes to my team, looking out for anything on social media I should be paying attention to. People say I work too much.
IT WAS A GOOD DAY I might watch some film on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but I go to bed early. My wife comes to bed late because she's retired. But at 10 o'clock I say, "I'll see you later, I'm going to sleep." And that's it.

Full text: Just months after they began dating in 2018, Jonathan Gold introduced Diana Ming, an only child of Chinese immigrants, to his large extended family. She said she felt immediately embraced.
Neither Diana Ming nor Jonathan Barrett Gold seemed to want their first date to ever end.
After connecting on the dating app Hinge, the two agreed to meet on March 22, 2018 at Goodnight Sonny, a bar in Manhattan's East Village.
"We instantly bonded while consuming spicy margaritas and laughing," said Ms. Ming, 30, a vice president for business operations at the Global Atlantic Financial Group, an insurance and annuities provider in New York. She had graduated from Dartmouth with a bachelor's degree in government and public policy.
"He was interested in me and curious about what kept me busy," she said.
Mr. Gold, 31, a software engineer at Amazon, found Ms. Ming gregarious and engaging, as well as intellectual and kind. "I was impressed by her and hoped she felt similarly about me," said Mr. Gold, who has a bachelor's degree and master's degree in computer science from Stanford.

At 1 a.m., they had closed the bar down. Then she followed Mr. Gold to the roof deck of a friend's apartment, for which he had the entry code, just two blocks away. They shared their first kiss on the deck, which overlooked Tompkins Square Park.
"I wanted to keep talking to him," said Ms. Ming, adding that she had found Mr. Gold refreshing and different and "felt giddy and sparked by him."
She got her wish. Just hours later, he texted Ms. Ming and asked her out to dinner.
Their relationship moved quickly. The two spent the next six months falling in love by seeing New York City through each other's eyes. This included hundreds of bike rides, hot yoga classes, Yankees games, food tours through Astoria, Queens, and batting cages in the Bronx.
In September, Mr. Gold invited Ms. Ming to his family's annual summer barbecue at his childhood home in Manhasset, N.Y., which 75 relatives and friends attended.
"Having a big family is part of my personality," said Mr. Gold, the oldest of five siblings. His mother died from cancer when he was in high school. "I envisioned being incorporated into someone else's large family, because they understand the things that come with that."
Ms. Ming, the daughter of Chinese immigrants who grew up in Morristown, N.J., is an only child. She said she "rarely had any connection to my extended family except for a few childhood visits to China."
"Marriage seemed like an unattainable idea," she added. "I thought, 'I'm never going to find someone who understands me and my cultural identity."'
The summer reunion was an important event for both Mr. Gold and Ms. Ming.
"Instead of feeling lost, I was embraced," Ms. Ming said. "I knew I wanted to marry John that day. Bonding with those closest to him helped me know him more intimately."
"At the party, I could hear her distinctive laugh from across the room, which let me know she was OK," Mr. Gold said. "She not only survived, she thrived. That was heartwarming."
They moved into an apartment together in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn in July 2019. On Oct. 2, 2021, while picnicking in Prospect Park, she turned around to find Mr. Gold, ring in hand, proposing on one knee. She said "yes" as Mr. Gold's father and siblings emerged from the entranceway of the park touting balloons, champagne and lobster rolls.
Ms. Ming's parents, who moved to Singapore in 2020, were eagerly waiting, at 2 a.m., their time, to join the festivities via FaceTime.
The couple married on June 3 at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Plant Family Collection before 180 guests. Victor Hollenberg, Ms. Ming's college roommate, who was ordained through Universal Life Church for the occasion, officiated.
Ms. Ming's culture was celebrated the night before with a performance by a traditional Chinese lion dance troop and a family-style dinner at Mr. Chow's in TriBeCa. Mr. Gold's Jewish heritage was infused throughout the wedding ceremony and reception when the couple stomped on a glass, read from the seven blessings, and danced the hora.
"John has made me more spontaneous and vulnerable," Ms. Ming said. "His family adds so much color and relationships to my world."
The groom spoke similarly. "When my mom passed away, I didn't have anyone to push me toward being the person I could be -- Diana does," he said. "She elevates me."

Gates's Visit to China Includes Meeting With Xi
In a rare encounter with an American business figure, Xi Jinping, China's leader, met Friday with Bill Gates as officials from Washington were set to arrive in Beijing in an effort to restart bilateral discussions.
Mr. Xi told Mr. Gates that he was "the first American friend I met in Beijing this year," according to People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper.
Mr. Gates's trip to China, his first since 2019, overlaps with a visit by Antony J. Blinken, his first since he became secretary of state. It was unclear if Mr. Blinken, who arrives Sunday, would meet with Mr. Xi.
Since Mr. Xi abruptly lifted a prolonged period of "zero Covid" restrictions in December, a string of American business leaders have returned to China, including Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. (Neither of those two met with Mr. Xi.)
Mr. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world's richest people, arrived in Beijing on Wednesday to visit health and development partners for his foundation, he said on Twitter.
Mr. Gates retains ties with China through the Gates Foundation, recently pledging $ 50 million in a renewed partnership with the Beijing municipal government and a top Chinese university. He started stepping away from Microsoft in 2008, devoting more of his time to his philanthropic projects, and left the Microsoft board in 2020. He remains Microsoft's largest individual shareholder with roughly $ 35 billion worth of stock, according to the financial data company FactSet. CHANG CHE
LIVESTREAMING
Twitch Star Signs Big Deal
To Switch to a Rival Site
One of Twitch's most popular streamers said on Friday that he was joining a rival streaming platform, Kick, in a significant blow to the Amazon-owned site and a sign of its increasingly strained relationship with content creators.
Félix Lengyel, a Canadian known online as xQc, is signing a two-year, roughly $ 70 million contract, with incentives that could push the total to about $ 100 million, said his agent, Ryan Morrison. Mr. Lengyel's deal -- about as large as the two-year contract extension signed by the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James last year -- could shake up the economics of the online entertainment world.
"This is more than most professional athletes and megastars," Mr. Morrison said. "This is one of the highest deals in entertainment, period."
Mr. Lengyel, 27, chats with fans, hosts reality shows and broadcasts himself playing video games. He has become a star in the livestreaming world, with nearly 12 million followers and the ability to attract tens of thousands of viewers at a given time. By some metrics, he is the most popular Twitch streamer.
"Kick is allowing me to try and do things I haven't been able to before," Mr. Lengyel said in a statement. "I'm extremely excited to take this opportunity and maximize it into new creative and fresh ideas over coming years."
Top livestream personalities can earn millions of dollars by broadcasting their content, but a number of them have left Twitch in recent years, attracted by lucrative deals from other platforms like YouTube. And some streamers have complained that Twitch has become less responsive to its online community and more focused on profitability. KELLEN BROWNING

Full text: This column will take you five minutes, according to the New York Times website, which now posts an estimated reading time for articles on its home page. You can easily finish it while waiting for your DoorDash, which will arrive in 12 minutes, shortly after your laundry cycle ends in -- check the app -- seven minutes.
Or this column will take 50 minutes because your kid will text you midway through reading it and you'll mindlessly toggle to another tab on your browser, then remember the email you were supposed to send first thing this morning. You'll stop to collect the DoorDash, which didn't actually come in 12 minutes but instead materialized in 22, just as you'd settled into a Zoom meeting. The laundry, on the other hand, will be ready in 12 minutes.
In a world where everything has a time stamp, everything is still somehow off-kilter.
That the pandemic completely warped our sense of time, leaving us with what feels like a collective case of dyschronometria, has been well documented. Figuring out when something happened has become a kind of a funhouse-mirror guessing game: Did we go to Florida one year ago or three? How long has that blue sofa been there? What happened to eighth grade?
While the specific distortion of pandemic time has passed -- at least for now -- time still does not seem to be moving forward at a predictable clip. The weather is wonky, disrupting the regular rhythm of the seasons. The workplace is still in flux, blurring the lines between labor time and leisure time. It is harder and harder to tell when we are in the middle of a thing and when the thing is definitively over. As Jenny Odell notes in her recent book "Saving Time," we are increasingly marked by "a deep suspicion that we are living on the wrong clock."
All we really want to know is, How much time will this take? When will it be over? And where the hell is my Uber already?
Our digital devices are supposedly here to help. They come with numerical capabilities that far exceed our own. We rely on them. But when each unit of measurement is conspicuously displayed -- from the increasing temperature on your preheating oven to the outdoor temperature displayed on your indoor phone -- even the slightest mathematical infraction can qualify as a major upset.
And our devices aren't above lying to us. They may think we don't notice -- and maybe we don't! We are simultaneously impatient and distracted. We haven't been counting because the machines have been counting for us -- down to the hundredth of a second. We're already in the middle of a download of that new operating system that just inexplicably leapfrogged from 43 minutes back up to 54 and it's too late to abort now. The algorithm is too strong for us.
Our meal delivery and ride share apps mess around with us all the time. Take that Uber. On some level, you know it's not actually coming in two minutes. If you're lucky, it will be here in five. But that time estimate may keep you hostage in a holding pattern so that you don't switch over to Lyft or hail a taxi. Uber may consider this part of its "magical customer experience," but what it can feel like to those of us with mere human intelligence is an app trap. Someone behind that math wall is presumably betting against your giving up and turning to a competitor's "two minutes."
The Kindle plays its own number games, offering an average estimated reading time. But that's for the average reader -- who is not necessarily you. Once it homes in on your particular blend of distractedness, the algorithm will adjust these times to what it perceives as your rate of progress. "Within two pages, my Kindle had become increasingly unimpressed with me," one reader noted on Alphr, a British technology site. "It promptly added 24 minutes to my reading time, like a spurned satnav irritated with me for trying my special alternative route." Other readers may witness unexpected leaps in the estimate, sometimes from checking out a footnote or flipping around in the book, forward and backward appraisals that make them feel like either a slowpoke or a "superhuman librarian."
Hold on just a minute -- or two -- there, HAL.
Does this mean we're being gaslit by our own technology? Are the machines and devices and digital authorities that are supposed to help us by providing estimated wait times, minutes until completion and expected arrival times deliberately giving us the wrong answers?
If so, they might only be following human orders. People have long manipulated time estimates. Passengers are regularly told their airline flight will take longer than anticipated -- only to arrive agreeably "early," even after a late departure. In 1986, for example, the estimated flying time for an American Airlines flight between Kennedy Airport in New York and Los Angeles Airport was about five hours 30 minutes. Today, the estimated flying time for the same flight averages around six hours 23 minutes. That's not because planes are flying more slowly but because airlines calculate the flying times based on other variables -- largely to improve their on-time arrival statistics, which the Department of Transportation began requiring in 1987 and are now posted online. This is referred to in the industry as schedule padding.
"It is definitely a marketing thing," Robert W. Mann, an airline consultant and former airline executive, told me. "The results generate a preference for the airline."
Fudged time can help make people feel better -- or worse. Anyone who has been a restaurant hostess knows that there's a standard lie you feed to waiting diners, whether it's the eternal "15 minutes" (to keep them waiting) or "at least an hour and a half" (to make them leave), depending on what message you're trying to impart. Recipe app designers, same thing: Sure, the summer farro salad will take you just 30 minutes to prepare -- assuming you have the knife skills of a sous chef. Half an hour in, the farro may be only half cooked, but you're on hold with the health insurance company, whose automated attendant promises there are only three people ahead of you. At least you are multitasking!
With the digital world becoming ever more artificially clever, perhaps it will start playing nicer with us. Is that too much to hope? We would like to trust in the machine, especially now that we are now engineered by machines at least as much as we are engineering them. I, for one, would like to believe you arrived at this sentence in exactly five minutes.

F.T.C. Sues To Stop Deal For Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agency had sued to halt the blockbuster deal last year. Its latest move in federal court would prevent the acquisition from being completed.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft on Monday to stop the company from closing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard, escalating the federal government's efforts to stymie the largest consumer technology deal in decades.
In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the F.T.C. said the move was necessary because "Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate" the deal. It asked the court to issue an order blocking the acquisition's closing by the end of the day on Thursday.
The lawsuit is the latest blow to Microsoft's purchase of Activision, which makes popular video games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Last year, the F.T.C. sued to block the deal through an in-house court, arguing it would damage competition in various parts of the video game market. The agency filed the separate lawsuit because unlike the F.T.C.'s in-house court, a federal court can issue a restraining order to stop a purchase from being completed.
Regulatory hurdles have piled up against the blockbuster deal, which has become a test for whether behemoth tech companies can complete major acquisitions amid backlash to the firms' growing power. In April, the British Competition and Markets Authority also moved to stop the deal, though regulators in the European Union said in May that it could go forward.
Governments around the world have been challenging the power of tech giants like Microsoft. The F.T.C. has accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of shutting off nascent competitors and has been investigating whether Amazon ran afoul of antitrust laws. The Department of Justice has filed multiple lawsuits arguing that Google has committed antitrust violations of its own.
Microsoft has appealed the British ruling to block the Activision deal and has pledged to fight the F.T.C. in court. The two companies had said they hoped the purchase would close by July.
The British portions of the deal cannot close while Microsoft's appeal moves forward. If a federal court grants the F.T.C.'s demand to stop the deal, it would also prevent Microsoft from completing the transaction in the United States.
Bill Baer, a former top government antitrust official, said the F.T.C.'s lawsuit was a response to the risk that Microsoft would try and circumvent the British ruling and "cause the injury the F.TC. is worried about" by closing the deal elsewhere.
Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that "Microsoft and Activision have not provided assurances" that they would not close the deal.
In a statement, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the company welcomed the "opportunity to present our case in federal court."
Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a note to employees that the company welcomed the news because it "accelerates the legal process." He added: "We will now have the opportunity to more quickly present the facts about our merger."
If Microsoft ushers the deal through, it would be a monumental moment for the $ 184 billion gaming industry. Microsoft earns billions of dollars each year in the video game business, but competitors like Nintendo and Sony -- which makes the PlayStation console -- have long been considered to have a better catalog of games that attract players to their devices. Adding Activision and its slate of gaming studios to Microsoft's Xbox consoles and its games subscription service could even the playing field.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has made blocking corporate deals a cornerstone of her strategy to rein in the tech giants and other big companies. The chip maker Nvidia and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin have dropped proposed deals after they were challenged by the F.T.C. under Ms. Khan.
Attempts to block other deals have been less successful. Last year, the F.T.C. tried to stop Meta from buying Within, a start-up that makes a virtual reality fitness game. A federal judge declined to stop the deal from closing, and the F.T.C. dropped its broader challenge to the purchase.
Microsoft has worked to gain approval from regulators for the Activision acquisition. Since announcing the deal a year and a half ago, the company has embarked on a charm offensive, meeting with regulators around the world and cutting deals with other gaming companies to assuage concerns that the deal would reduce availability of Activision's games and raise their prices.
But those moves failed to persuade the British and American regulators to approve the deal. The new lawsuit by the F.T.C., analysts said, could be an effort by the United States to regain some prominence in the legal fight, as well as an acknowledgment that Microsoft could close the deal despite Britain's objections.
"The F.T.C. is reaffirming how adamant it is about blocking this deal," said Joost van Dreunen, a gaming analyst and professor at New York University. "They want to make sure that they are still driving the bus in this."

Washington Post Publisher Resigns in His 10th Year: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Patty Stonesifer, the former chief executive of Martha's Table, will be The Post's interim chief executive.
Fred Ryan, the publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, told employees on Monday that he was stepping down, ending his nearly decade-long run as the newspaper's top business executive. He was appointed by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and owner of The Post.
In a note to staff, Mr. Ryan, a former Reagan aide, said his next job would be leading the Center on Public Civility, a new project by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute that is backed by Mr. Bezos.
In an interview, Mr. Ryan said he was proud of his business record at The Post, which included increasing the newspaper's digital subscribers to 2.5 million from 35,000.
He also said he was proud of a new partnership on press freedom -- Mr. Ryan successfully lobbied Iran for the release of the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and spoke out forcefully against the murder of the former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
"I think if you look back over the arc, it's been one of the most remarkable transformations in a news organization that was primary print and local, becoming primarily global and digital," Mr. Ryan said.
Mr. Bezos thanked Mr. Ryan for his service in a note to employees, saying he led the newspaper through a period of "innovation, journalistic excellence and growth."
News of Mr. Ryan's departure stunned the newsroom. The masthead and senior editors were notified about Mr. Ryan's departure on Monday morning, shortly before the official announcement, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
Mr. Ryan has had an uneven track record at The Post. Tapped shortly after Mr. Bezos acquired the newspaper in 2013 for $ 250 million, Mr. Ryan teamed up with Marty Baron, the paper's former executive editor, to replenish The Post's newsroom and expand its journalism, leading to a surge in digital subscriptions.
The Post has remained a premier journalistic institution, and this year won two Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting and feature writing, and two Post reporters won a Pulitzer for a nonfiction book.
But subscriber growth has been sluggish in recent years, as the heightened reader interest in politics waned from its boom times during the attention-grabbing administration of former President Donald J. Trump, and The Post has struggled to maintain momentum. The current number of subscribers -- 2.5 million -- is roughly unchanged from a year ago and down from the three million The Post said it had in 2020.
In interviews with The New York Times, many Post employees have expressed frustration with what they describe as a turgid business culture led by Mr. Ryan, mired in endless meetings and dead-end strategy memos. There has been friction between Mr. Ryan and Sally Buzbee, who joined The Post as executive editor nearly two years ago, over the direction of the publication.
Late last year, Mr. Ryan accused Cameron Barr, the second-most-senior editor, of leaking unflattering information to the press and sought his ouster, according to three people familiar with the episode. Mr. Barr, who announced his departure from The Post this month, declined to comment. The Post declined to comment on their interactions.
A person familiar with Mr. Ryan's accusation said there was no evidence to support Mr. Ryan's claims.
Mr. Bezos made a rare visit to The Post in January, after reports about the publication's struggles. He met with editorial leaders and business executives and made it clear he was there to listen rather than to ask questions.
In those meetings, numerous employees raised concerns with Mr. Bezos about a lack of business strategy for The Post, and how Mr. Ryan had managed the newspaper, according to a person with knowledge of those meetings. Mr. Bezos told the employees that he planned to be more involved and had no plans to sell the newspaper. His appearance reassured some staff members who were worried he was no longer committed the publication.
Shortly after his visit, The Post laid off 20 journalists and shut down its popular video-gaming section, while saying it would not fill a further 30 positions, blaming the "economic climate."
The Post has continued to lose top talent since then, including its chief revenue officer, Joy Robins, and its senior culture editor David Malitz, who both joined The Times. High-profile reporters like Eli Saslow, Robert Samuels and Stephanie McCrummen have also departed The Post this year for other publications.
The Post is close to replacing some of the executives who have left, according to a person familiar with its recruitment efforts.
Some employees expressed relief on Monday upon hearing the news of Mr. Ryan's impending departure. In an instant messaging chat for employees in the Washington Post union, one staff member suggested a party playlist for the occasion, and another sought a volunteer to procure champagne.
Katie Mettler, a co-chair of The Washington Post Guild, said in the chat that the past few years had been "extraordinarily trying" for employees at the newspaper.
"There is a lot we don't know about today's news or what comes next," she wrote, "but I, for one, am cautiously optimistic."
Mr. Ryan's successor will be faced with jump-starting the newspaper's subscriber growth as well as facing down industry headwinds in the digital advertising market. The coming presidential election could provide a tailwind, as readers turn to The Post for its authoritative political coverage.
There are signs Mr. Bezos has been more involved with the operations of The Post. This spring, he conducted regular meetings with Post managers, asking pointed questions about finances, online strategy and other issues.
Patty Stonesifer, the former chief executive of Martha's Table, a provider of food and clothing for low-income people, will be The Post's interim chief executive, Mr. Bezos said in the note to employees.
"You'll soon see for yourself why I admire her," he said. "Her skills, judgment and character all stand out. She also understands the importance of our mission and has a deep respect for the work we do here."
Ms. Stonesifer will help lead the search for the permanent successor to Mr. Ryan, who will remain publisher for the next two months.
In a meeting with the newsroom on Monday afternoon, Ms. Stonesifer said she expected to be in the role for six months to a year.
She called herself "the No. 1 fan of The Washington Post," and she assured the staff that Mr. Bezos "loves The Washington Post," according to an audio recording of the meeting.
"The Post is a big part of his DNA now, I think," she said.
Ms. Stonesifer said there were no plans for any additional layoffs.
"I don't think it's right for an interim to overhaul," Ms. Stonesifer said, adding, "I'm here to keep this operation-building momentum."
Ms. Stonesifer said she would remain as an independent director on Amazon's board, a position she has held since 1997.

At Tribeca, A Red Carpet For Podcasts: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The Tribeca Festival and audio artists each have something the other wants. Can they make it work?
When Winnie and Alex Kemp submitted their first original fiction podcast "The Imperfection" to the 2021 Tribeca Festival, they set their expectations near the curb.
The couple, co-founders of the podcast studio Wolf at the Door, believed in the project. Making the nine-episode series -- a surrealist caper about two impaired friends whose psychiatrist goes missing -- had been a nearly yearlong labor of love, but early signals from the market had been humbling. An agent the couple hired to find distribution for the show had come back empty-handed, and emails to 200 journalists generated just one reply -- a rejection.
At the Tribeca Festival, which dropped the word "film" from its name that year and expanded its focus on video games, virtual reality, music and audio, "The Imperfection" received a warmer reception. It was among the inaugural slate of 12 officially selected podcasts to premiere at the festival.
Being chosen by Tribeca meant "The Imperfection" was featured with the other festival selections on the Apple Podcasts and Audible home pages, helping it reach the top 20 of Apple Podcasts' fiction chart. The show was later nominated for best podcast of the year and best fiction writing at The Ambie awards, the industry's answer to the Oscars. And the Kemps got new representation with the Creative Artists Agency; last year, they sold the television rights to the show, and they will co-write the pilot script.
"It was a huge boon to us helping our first show get found," Winnie Kemp said. "There are so many shows out there; the hardest thing to figure out is, 'How do I cut through the noise?"'
Though it has never equaled the most prestigious galas of the film world, the Tribeca Festival, which began last Wednesday and will feature audio selections this week, has emerged as a uniquely appealing showcase for podcast creators. The demand for credible curatorial organizations is high in podcast land, where an explosion of titles -- over two million have been created since the start of 2020, according to the database Listen Notes -- has made it hard to break out even as overall listenership has increased.
While other festivals exist specifically for audio storytelling, and some documentary festivals include podcast selections, Tribeca's history -- it was founded in 2002 by Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff -- and association with Hollywood talent have made it an instant player in the audio community.
"This is the next frontier of interesting, creative, independent storytelling -- so much so that discoverability has been a challenge for audiences," said Cara Cusumano, the director and vice president of programming at the Tribeca Festival. "That's our forte; there was a place for us to play a role in this ecosystem and deliver an experience that you won't find anywhere else."
This year, 16 podcasts are competing for various awards in fiction and nonfiction categories. The selections include Alissa Escarce, Nellie Gilles and Joe Richman's "The Unmarked Graveyard," a documentary series about the anonymous dead of New York's Hart Island cemetery; Georgie Aldaco's "These Were Humans," a sketch comedy series that imagines the artifacts of an extinct human race; and Glynnis MacNicol, Emily Marinoff and Jo Piazza's "Wilder," a nonfiction series about the life and legacy of the "Little House on the Prairie" author Laura Ingalls Wilder.
The festival will also host live tapings and premieres of several podcasts that are not in competition, including "Pod Save America," Crooked Media's popular political talk show; "Just Jack & Will," the actors Sean Hayes and Eric McCormack's new "Will & Grace" rewatch podcast and "You Feeling This?" an Los Angeles-centric fiction anthology from James Kim.
Davy Gardner, the curator of audio storytelling at Tribeca, said the festival aims to demonstrate that podcasts deserve a comparable level of "cultural recognition" to films.
"Tribeca is giving these creators the full red-carpet treatment," he said. "This is its own art form and we want to help elevate it and push it forward."
Film festivals have long been the envy of audio artists. In the early 1990s, Sundance helped create a vogue for independent and art-house films that blossomed into a booming market. Filmmakers who entered the festival with few resources and no name recognition could exit it with the backing of a major studio and a burgeoning career.
No similar infrastructure exists for independent podcasters. As major funders like Spotify and Amazon have consolidated around easy-to-monetize true-crime documentaries and celebrity interview shows -- a trend that has intensified amid industrywide economic woes and a series of layoffs -- many artists have struggled to find support for less obviously commercial work.
"If you don't have a promotional budget or aren't attached to a big network it's really hard to find an audience," said Bianca Giaever, whose memoiristic podcast "Constellation Prize" was featured by the Tribeca Festival in 2021. (She is also a former producer of the Times' podcast "The Daily"). "It's a vicious cycle, because then less of that work gets made."
Of course, even award-winning films at the biggest festivals don't always become hits. And podcast creators at Tribeca have to compete for audiences and prospective business partners accustomed to filling their schedules with movie premieres.
Johanna Zorn, who co-founded the long-running Third Coast International Audio Festival and presented audio work at multiple documentary film festivals in the 2010s, said the payoff sometimes fell short of the promise.
"We went to some fabulous film festivals and we were happy to be there," she said. "But did they help us get real press coverage? Get us into a room with people who could lead us to the next thing? Give us something that we could really build on? Not so much."
To cast the podcast selections in an optimal light, Gardner and his colleagues have had to learn how to exhibit an art form not customarily experienced in a communal setting. They have planned around a dozen events at theaters and other venues around Manhattan that will pair excerpts from featured work with live discussions or supplementary video.
One thing they won't include? Quiet rooms with only an audio track and an empty stage.
"I've tried it," Gardner said wearily. "It's incredibly awkward."

Saudi Arabia and Israel Are Reinventing Themselves: [Op-Ed]

Author: Friedman, Thomas L

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This article has been updated to include new information about Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meetings with Saudi officials.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- "Your final destination is Tel Aviv?"
I've been a reporter in the Middle East since 1979, and those are six words I'd never heard in the place where I was standing about the place where I was going.
I was checking in to fly from Doha, Qatar, to Tel Aviv, via Dubai. It was a once inconceivable connection, and now it tripped off the tongue of the FlyDubai agent at Doha International Airport with the same nonchalance as if she were asking if I was flying to Cairo via Riyadh.
My first instinct was to ask her: Could you please keep your voice down?
After all, many of us based in Beirut as reporters in the late 1970s didn't even use the word "Israel." We referred to it only as "Dixie" -- the region south of Lebanon. Now the airport codes DIA, DXB and TLV were fused together on my luggage for all to see.
A few days later, I hopscotched to three more cities that suddenly seemed closer than ever: early breakfast in Tel Aviv; lunch in Amman, Jordan; and late dinner in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
This journey was unlike anything I'd ever experienced in a region that has long been my second home, and it allowed me to grasp something quite remarkable: how onetime enemies and rivals across the Middle East are on the cusp of becoming so much more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. It's creating previously unthinkable partnerships, as well as huge internal stresses, as people in the neighborhood are trying to figure out just how modern, secular, open, entwined and democratic they want to be.
No two countries exemplify this moment better than America's two most important Middle East allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Both are simultaneously undergoing fundamental internal struggles over their identities. The relationship between religious authorities and the state -- as well as the very legal, social and economic rules of the game -- in both Saudi Arabia and Israel has never been more up for grabs since each country's founding.
In Saudi Arabia, the societal transformations being imposed from the top down by the iron-fisted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (M.B.S.) are now so profound that if you have not been to Saudi Arabia in the past five years, you may as well have not been there at all. When I last visited Riyadh, at the end of 2017, Saudi women were not permitted to drive. Today, not only are women behind the wheel, but the first Saudi female and first Arab female astronaut, Rayyanah Barnawi, just helped drive a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center up to the International Space Station.
Meanwhile, the threat to Israel's original aspiration to be both a Jewish state and a democratic one is now so profound, posed by an extremist government trying to crush the independence of Israel's Supreme Court, that it has produced an unprecedented 22 straight weeks of massive street protests from democracy-devoted Israelis. If you have not been to Israel in the past five months, you may as well have not been there at all.
In other words, America is now, in effect, present at the re-creation of two nations vital to our interests. Two nations who are at the same time secretly discussing making peace with each other. And two nations that are also figuring out how close to be with America's increasingly Middle East-focused great-power rival, China.
When I was the New York Times bureau chief in Jerusalem between 1984 and 1988, there were no diplomatic relations between Israel and China, and we were just thrilled when the first kosher Chinese restaurant opened near our office, even though there was no pork in the won ton soup. Today, as Israel is bursting with defense- and cyber-related technology start-ups, Beijing has rapidly increased its efforts to buy into or partner with Israeli companies and universities, so much so that Israeli security services now have to keep a close eye on Chinese visitors and diplomats. China also recently brokered a deal to restore diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is now China's biggest supplier of oil, and China is Saudi Arabia's biggest oil customer, to boot.
For all of these reasons, America needs to toss away any inhibitions and play as active a role as possible with Israel and Saudi Arabia. This is no time for America to pick up stakes from the Middle East. This is a time to lean in with our values and soft-power tools like never before.
President Biden should invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Oval Office, like all previous Israeli prime ministers, only if he will answer two questions: One, are you occupying the West Bank and committed to resolving its permanent status through negotiations with the Palestinians, or do you see Israel's current control of the Palestinians as the permanent status, never to be changed? We need to know once and for all. And two, are you committed to ensuring that any major changes to Israel's court system will be put in place with broad public support to ensure political stability, because the United States has a huge interest in its most important military ally in the region not descending into civil war over judicial changes?
For the past 75 years Israel has been a trusted and vital strategic partner of the United States, but that was always based on shared interests and shared values. If those values aren't shared any longer, we need to know that. We need to get behind those Israelis who want to preserve Israel as a democracy -- and keep locking the White House gates to anyone who doesn't.
As for Saudi Arabia, at a time when its Aramco oil company rivals Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, its youth bulge is just coming of age and Riyadh has replaced Cairo as the most important power in the Arab world, we need to engage with Saudi leaders and society regularly -- to ensure that Riyadh exercises power responsibly and to encourage the people and leaders in Saudi Arabia who are trying to make it more religiously moderate, more respectful of women, more tolerant of all faiths, more economically diversified and more welcoming of dissenting opinions. Saudi Arabia is also the home of Islam's most sacred cities, Mecca and Medina, so how it modernizes and pluralizes will influence mosques and Muslim communities across the globe.
Biden has steadily become more confident dealing with both Netanyahu's Israel and M.B.S.'s Saudi Arabia -- twisting arms and drawing red lines where necessary and looking to foster bridge building within and between their societies (and with America) where possible. But much engagement still lies ahead to help keep this region, and these two countries in particular, tilted toward more pluralism, integration and tolerance.
Let me show you why in detail with a few postcards from my trip.
My first morning in Tel Aviv, I got up at 7 and walked along the beachfront promenade to get my 10,000 steps. At one point, two barefoot young Israeli women dressed in black wet suits passed me by, balancing surfboards on their heads. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself: I wonder if Theodor Herzl, when he conceived the idea of a modern Jewish state back in Europe in the 19th century, ever imagined a sight like this?
Some minutes later, two other young women approached. They appeared to be Israeli Arab Muslims, wearing black scarves on their heads and tennis shoes under their long dresses.
They triggered a different thought: This country -- this whole region -- will thrive only if these four women can share the same beachfront promenade with dignity, in a society and culture that values live and let live. Everyone is just too intertwined now for anything else. But live and let live takes work and the right leadership, whether it comes from heads of government or next-door neighbors.
An old friend of mine, Uri Dromi, a former Israeli Air Force pilot, told me about an experience he had as he personally grappled with the necessity of live and let live in modern Israel. A couple of weeks ago, he and some Air Force colleagues decided to visit Bnei Brak, a predominantly ultra-Orthodox city east of Tel Aviv, which is strongly backing Netanyahu's efforts to overhaul the court, given how it often intervenes to curb the power and perquisites of the ultra-Orthodox. Dromi has been mobilizing other retired airmen to oppose Netanyahu's effort, and they went to Bnei Brak to try to understand how it can be "that under the same Israeli skies there are people who think so differently from me," Dromi explained.
The night before the visit, Dromi called the kosher Hazvi Bakery there to arrange for dozens of challah breads that Jews often eat on the Sabbath, along with plastic bags for each one with the bakery's kosher logo. He used the breads as his calling card, putting a note on each bag of challah: "Shabbat is dear to all our hearts. So is democracy."
It triggered several conversations that made Dromi reflect. He recalled an ultra-Orthodox woman telling him, "You are pushing your liberal agenda on me, and I have to defend myself." She added, "My husband studies all day, and I am a computer engineer." When Dromi asked her why her husband doesn't work, she answered, "Because after the Holocaust, we need big families, and someone has to keep the torch of the Torah alive." To liberal ears, Dromi remarked, "that may sound like nonsense, but it is deeply believed by them."
Dromi recalled how, as he sat on a bench, a young ultra-Orthodox boy approached him and asked, "What is democracy?"
"It touched my heart," Dromi recounted. "I said, 'In democracy everyone is equal, like you and me, and if something happens between us, we go to the court.' He said he was told you should not go to an Israeli government court because 'it was a goyim court,"' meaning it served gentiles.
A day later, Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, shared with me that most Fridays, he and his wife go grocery shopping at a local market. He said the biggest question he receives from fellow shoppers every time he's in the store now, regarding the talks he has convened to broker some kind of deal over judicial changes, is, "When is there going to be a compromise?"
I am convinced that a lot more people in Israel and in the region are exhausted from hating one another and have transcended the political divides -- or at least sure want to -- within their societies and among their societies. Their lived realities are now so much more intertwined than you'd think.
As much as Israeli media outlets and politicians are narrowcasting their ideologies every day, Israel's emerging blended society is on full display every night on prime-time TV -- an ultra-Orthodox female celebrity chef on one channel, an Israeli Druze female celebrity chef on another, an Israeli Arab star journalist on another. And this week the sports news has been dominated by the dream journey of Israel's under-20 soccer team, which just beat Brazil 3-2 in the quarterfinals of the under-20 World Cup championship in Argentina. The Israeli team is composed of young, observant Jews, secular Jews and three Israeli Arabs. Two of Israel's three goals against Brazil were scored by Israeli Arabs, prompting one wag on Israeli Twitter to remark, "No Arabs, no goals."
Unfortunately, since 1996, Netanyahu's whole strategy of winning elections and governing has been to divide, divide, divide -- left from right, Jews from Palestinian Arabs, secular from religious, Ashkenazim from Sephardim -- and to try to win every election with just 50.001 percent. (Just like Donald Trump.)
He's hardly the only problem, but he's been a huge figure in Israeli political life since first winning office -- and he's now in his sixth term. Netanyahu is smart and a once-in-a-generation political talent, but his paranoia, dishonesty and now fear of going to prison on charges of corruption have made him a toxic figure who prioritizes holding power at any cost, not unifying the nation.
This time, though, I think Bibi drove one wedge too many into the heart of Israel's body politic.
I walked alongside the remarkable democracy protest march in Tel Aviv on the night of Saturday, May 20 -- the 20th straight week tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to resist Netanyahu's attempted judicial takeover. One particular placard in Hebrew caught my eye: "Bibi, you came down on the wrong generation."
He certainly did. I was observing the demonstration with one of Israel's leading columnists, Nahum Barnea of Yedioth Ahronoth, and his wife, Tammy. At one point, she looked around at all the energy of the young demonstrators chanting in Hebrew, "De-mo-crat-ya," and remarked to me that this is Israelis' attempt "to repair the damage of Rabin's assassination."
I never heard that before. Tammy explained that the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an ultranationalist was not just an attack on the Oslo peace process that he was leading; it was also an attack on the whole democratic process in Israel itself.
Rabin's killer voted with a bullet, and then his political allies, some of the very same Jewish supremacists now in the Israeli cabinet, voted with their ballots, which paved the way for the first of Netanyahu's six terms. Ever since then, Jewish settlers have been implanted deeper and deeper into the West Bank, making a two-state solution nearly impossible, and more resources and powers have been transferred from the secular state to the ultra-Orthodox, making them kingmakers in Israeli politics.
Now a younger Israeli generation -- many of whom were born after Rabin's death -- is rising up and joining with the center of Israeli society to say that this whole drift from democracy has got to stop.
As with all such movements, the key is turning the spirited street energy of this wholly new center-left, center-right coalition into sustained political energy that can one day gain elected office and be an engine for new live-and-let-live approaches inside Israel -- and maybe, one day, even between Israelis and Palestinians as well. We'll see.
I will say this, though: Having observed firsthand the protest movements in Egypt, Hong Kong and Istanbul, this one is a different kettle of fish. It is spearheaded by a coalition of Israel's most elite technologists and war fighters, who are now deploying the skills they honed competing in California's Silicon Valley or night fighting in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley to make clear to Netanyahu that they can and will shut Israel down -- from its governing institutions to its start-up economy and its air force -- if he tries to take away the independence of the Supreme Court.
Listen to a few of the protest organizers, and you'll understand how unique this movement is. "I started as an air force pilot and have founded six companies," said Gigi Levy-Weiss. "We've created 50,000 jobs. When we started, we all realized that we cannot stay on the sidelines anymore." This time, "we are not stopping at preventing this legislation" but rather thinking about "how we build the infrastructure" that will permanently guard Israel's democracy, he said.
Shira Eting, a female Israeli Air Force Cobra helicopter pilot, said: "I was able to become a pilot because of a Supreme Court decision. I was the 19th woman to graduate from the Air Force flight academy. Without the Supreme Court, my life would be different. I am married to a woman." She added, "If I want to be the mother of my daughter," she needs the protection of the Supreme Court from the ultra-Orthodox who would oppose it. Thanks to Israel's Supreme Court, "people can make their dreams come true."
David Gillerman, who served in the Israeli Air Force's elite search and rescue team and is now a major real estate developer in Israel, told me that he told his children that he was getting deeply involved in the democracy protest movement "so they have a proper country to grow up in. This is our new independence war. All of this has woken up a sleeping lion."
Bibi definitely came down on the wrong cowboys and cowgirls.
But never, ever underestimate how far Netanyahu will go to stay in power. In order to keep his coalition together, he approved a budget two weeks ago that transfers massive amounts of shekels to the schools of his ultra-Orthodox party allies -- schools that reject Israel's core curriculum -- and to their religious students and adults who do not serve in the army and to West Bank Jewish settlers.
"The new government budget includes an unprecedented increment in allocations to the settlers and ultra-Orthodox, including full funding of schools to not teach English, science and math. This budgetary increment alone is more than Israel invests each year in higher education altogether -- or 14 years of complete funding for the Technion, Israel's M.I.T.," said Dan Ben-David, a macroeconomist who has focused on the interaction between Israel's demography and education at Tel Aviv University, where he heads the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research. "It is completely nuts."
The ultra-Orthodox share of Israel's population doubles roughly every 25 years, added Ben-David. "Today it is 24 percent of the infants. By 2050, it will be half of Israel's infants. None of them learn basic civics or separation of powers and how liberal democracy works, let alone receiving the tools to thrive in a modern economy," he told me.
"Unless we get our act together now, this will be the final nail into the coffin of our future," he said.
So imagine how bizarre it was to find myself -- three days after talking to Ben-David in Tel Aviv -- sitting in the living room of Saudi Arabia's minister of education, Yousef al-Benyan, listening to him describe how Saudi Arabia has been overhauling all of its public schools and university curriculums to develop a work force of men and women who can compete in a post-oil age.
Public school textbooks have been scrubbed to eliminate materials that promote intolerance of other faiths or subservience for women, and the government is doubling down on teacher training, all with the aim of "instilling technological proficiency alongside critical thinking, problem solving and analytical capabilities" to align the Saudi education system "with competitive international standards," as a recent Oxford Business Group study put it. It has a long way to go, but compared with a decade ago, it constitutes an education revolution.
And like practically every other minister I met in Riyadh, al-Benyan was bursting with pride over a national team of Saudi male and female science and math students recently winning 27 prizes at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in Dallas. More than 70 countries were competing there, in the world's largest international precollege science competition.
It is interesting to note that al-Benyan formerly led one of the most important companies in the country, SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation), which is among the world's largest diversified petrochemical companies. The Saudi leadership wanted an education minister who understands what it takes to get a good private sector job today, because the days of getting a B.A. in Islamic studies and thinking you can get a cushy government job are over.
It's just the opposite of what Israel is doing with its religious youth.
Go figure.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia is now trying to suppress the strict religious forces that Israel is increasingly empowering. But the Saudi ruling family has a lot to make up for, because the religious excesses it indulged at home and funded abroad beginning in 1979 warped the whole Muslim world and helped to inspire 9/11. The short story: The Islamist and women-suppressing traditionalists here were given free rein after 1979, after extremists took over the Grand Mosque in Mecca and accused the ruling al-Sauds of being insufficiently pious. In response, the ruling family gave the clerics unrivaled powers to impose the most puritanical brand of Islam at home and export it. It changed the face of Islam globally.
Mohammed bin Salman, who is the effective ruler now that his elderly father, King Salman, has stepped back from most of his public leadership duties, has basically been reversing 1979 -- putting the religious authorities tightly under the government's thumb and the most radical Islamists in jail and lifting their heavy lid off Saudi society -- with strong buy-in from the two-thirds of its population that is under the age of 30.
I found it quite symbolic that in 2021, M.B.S.'s Islamic affairs minister ordered all mosques to "lower the volume" on their loudspeakers, "saying families had been complaining that competing speakers were keeping their children awake," as Reuters reported.
The big question for Saudi Arabia is whether the country can stay stable and achieve even half of its ambitions, at a time when every Saudi is being asked to hop on a bullet train to modernity that aims to make up for decades of drift under tired old men, for whom change at five miles an hour was fast enough but was so sclerotic it was threatening the viability of the whole Saudi system.
What do I mean by a bullet train? When I was last here, in late 2017, M.B.S. surprised the country by announcing that Saudi women and girls would be permitted for the first time to attend soccer games as fans.
I came back last week and discovered that a Saudi women's premier soccer league is now headed into its second season.
When I was last here in 2017, M.B.S. had announced that women would be granted the right to drive. When I came back last week, I discovered that in March 2022, the racer Aseel al-Hamad became the first Saudi woman to drive a Formula 1 car in Saudi Arabia and Reema Juffali became the first Saudi woman to compete in an international racing series in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, in 2019. Summon an Uber in Riyadh today, and a female driver might fetch you.
The pace and extent of change in Saudi society has been underreported in part because few foreign reporters visited during Covid, when so many reforms here achieved escape velocity, and in part because many reporters -- myself included -- struggle with how to write about authentic positive changes in Saudi Arabia when the author of so many of them is M.B.S., who in 2018 also enabled the grotesque and senseless dismemberment of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The only answer for Biden is to talk about both. To just set aside what M.B.S.'s people did to Khashoggi would be immoral and inconsistent with American values and interests. So, too, would be setting aside the Saudis' continuing curtailment of any public expressions of dissent or criticism of the leadership on any issue. M.B.S. would benefit from letting more Saudi voices be heard at this time of massive and rapid change.
But for American officials to adopt a permanently standoffish approach to Saudi Arabia would be irresponsible. It would ignore the extensive and popular reforms that M.B.S. has unleashed at home that could transform Saudi Arabia and the whole Muslim world in some very healthy ways -- ways that are also hugely in America's interest.
This tension is never going to go away as long as M.B.S. is running the show here. If you want to write about or engage with only countries without moral quandaries, you've come to the wrong neighborhood.
It's late afternoon in Riyadh, and I am sitting in the Salam coffee shop, one of scores of new coffee houses and restaurants that have opened here since I last visited. I am with three Saudi 20-somethings, two of whom, men, were college educated in America and chose to come back to be part of the reform movement here, and another, a woman, who was educated here. We are inside, but outside, they point out to me, are four Saudi women, hair only loosely covered, enjoying their coffee and vaping. I never saw that here before.
These young people did not want to speak on the record. As I said, for all the radical social, religious and economic reforms here, this is still an absolute monarchy, where you can get arrested and imprisoned just for tweeting mild criticism of M.B.S. or his government. (The Saudi government has also grown very adept at using Twitter bots to attack critics and amplify support for the leadership.)
And yet there are more than a few young Saudis who use M.B.S.'s image as a screen saver, and it is authentic. Why? Because everything is relative. You cannot imagine what it was like to be a modern Saudi young woman before M.B.S. completely uprooted the mutawa -- the Muslim religious police -- who for decades terrorized the population and could arrest any woman for a lock of hair hanging too loosely from her veil or, in the case of a young male Saudi friend of mine, try to prevent someone from going through passport control on his way to study abroad because his hair was too long and he was going to an "infidel" college.
Being allowed to drive, the young woman I was having coffee with explained, is about more than just driving. "It is about me driving my own life now. You come here, and you see women driving today, and it doesn't mean anything to anyone else in the world, but it means a lot to me. My whole teenage years, my goal was to live abroad. I thought if this country is going to change, it is going to take centuries and decades. I studied literature, and we studied women in the Renaissance and the changes they went through. I never thought I'd be one of them."
And she is not alone. Saudi Arabia has long had "one of the lowest female labor force participation rates in the world," noted a 2021 report by the Brookings Institution. In 2018 "the share of Saudi women who had a job or were actively looking for one was 19.7 percent of the adult population of women with Saudi citizenship." It added, "In the years before that, the rate was much lower."
But in the wake of M.B.S.'s decision to permit women to drive -- and those 21 and over to no longer be required to get permission from a so-called male guardian to apply for a passport or travel abroad -- the labor force participation rate of Saudi women jumped 64 percent in two years, to 33 percent by the end of 2020. It grew to 37 percent in 2022. This is still hardly a paradise for women -- women's rights activists have been detained -- but compared with what it was just six years ago, the change is extensive.
This generation of Saudi leaders is acutely aware that "oil will not be there forever," said Saudi Arabia's minister of economy and planning, Faisal Alibrahim, an M.I.T. grad who, like so many ministers here today, came from the private sector. "So our competitiveness has to come from other places, and our sources of growth have to diversify if we are going to make the economy more resilient and unlock the full potential of the society."
That meant finally unlocking the full potential of the female half of society after centuries. This generation of Saudi leaders concluded, noted Alibrahim, that "social and cultural change" was not just a hopeful "byproduct of economic development"; it was the "necessary ingredient for it."
This is an important U.S. foreign policy interest. Why? After it was announced in October 2017 that Saudi women would be able to attend public sporting events, guess what happened. Iranian women next door, who had been banned from such opportunities since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, demanded the same rights and were granted them in 2019 -- after "the death of a fan who had set herself alight after being arrested for trying to attend a match," BBC News reported.
This is not complicated: Ever since the revolution, Iran and Saudi Arabia have competed for which was the most authentically pious Islamic country -- and they exported that competition around the Arab and Muslim world, pushing mosques and madrassas to preach the most puritanical, anti-women and anti-religious-pluralism ideas.
Iranian women are now rebelling for their own reasons, throwing off their head coverings in defiance of the clerics. But there is no question in my mind that a Saudi Arabia that is liberalizing socially, culturally, religiously and economically will not only stimulate more reform around the Arab and Muslim world; it also can't help but be another source of pressure on Iran's Dark Ages clerical leadership. What happens in Saudi Arabia does not stay in Saudi Arabia. That was true when it was Wahhabi fundamentalism -- and hopefully it will be true with a more moderate Islam.
When I started working in this region, Jews were not welcome to visit Saudi Arabia unless their last name was Kissinger. Today, Israel and Saudi Arabia are quietly talking about terms of peace. It is a three-cornered shot. The Saudis want Israel's help with Congress to secure a long-term U.S.-Saudi security deal, a civilian nuclear energy program and access to America's most advanced weapons -- in exchange for Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel.
The Israelis keep telling me that if they help deliver those goods from the United States, the Saudis will normalize relations with Israel without demanding any concessions from Israel for the Palestinians.
I don't believe it. From my conversations with a senior Saudi official, the Saudis still have not made up their minds about how much they will require Israel to do vis-à-vis the Palestinians in return for opening relations -- but it won't be zero. Saudi Arabia is very competitive these days with the United Arab Emirates, and Riyadh will almost certainly want to get more from Israel than the U.A.E. got for signing the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu knows there is going to be a price, but he is trying to keep it as small as possible, diplomatic sources told me.
Never thought I'd write this, but: Saudi Arabia may not be interested in Jewish history, but Jewish history is now very interested in Saudi Arabia. That's because the conditions that Saudi Arabia demands from the Jewish state in return for normalization will have a huge impact on whether Israel can remain a Jewish state and a democratic state.
The Saudis could cement Netanyahu's extremist coalition in power for years -- by rewarding Bibi with the ultimate prize of diplomatic relations with Riyadh -- without any Israeli concessions to the Palestinians in the West Bank. But this would likely lock Israel into an apartheid future.
Or the Saudis could demand Israeli overtures to the Palestinians that would preserve the possibility of a two-state solution -- and the hope that Israel could remain both democratic and Jewish -- by forcing Netanyahu to choose between his extremist one-state allies and making history by opening relations with Saudi Arabia.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in Riyadh this week with M.B.S. to discuss the prospects of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. According to diplomatic sources, the Biden team is ready to work with the Saudis on forging a long-term security arrangement with Riyadh and a civilian nuclear program. But the Biden team also knows this will require coordination with Congress and concessions from Israel vis-à-vis the Palestinians.
Watch this space.
To understand America's long-term staying power in this swiftly changing region, I want to quickly take you back to my stop in Doha, where I visited the giant U.S. Al Udeid air base nearby.
So many people are suddenly talking to so many other people they weren't talking to before: Saudi Arabia is talking to Iran via China. Egypt is talking to Qatar. The U.A.E. is talking to Qatar. Turkey is talking to Egypt. And all the Sunni Arab states are now suddenly talking to Syria. And most of them are also talking to Israel.
It's the Middle East equivalent of square dancing, and this do-si-do is not hard to explain: the chaotic U.S. departure from Afghanistan under Biden; the failure of the United States to respond to Iranian-sponsored attacks on Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. during the Trump and Biden administrations; Trump's sudden, idiotic push to remove U.S. troops from Syria, where they were protecting the Kurds and fighting ISIS. All of these turning points have a lot of folks here convinced that America has one foot out the door. They'd better learn to dance with new partners, the thinking goes, so they aren't alone if Uncle Sam does step away.
I think that fear is exaggerated, but it is not without some merit. Given the pull of the Ukraine war and the long-term challenge of China in the Pacific, if the United States is going to remain a credible power in this region, it is going to have to think about military strategy and financial costs differently. And that brings me to the most interesting thing I saw and heard at Al Udeid.
I walked into a big garage, and this is what I noticed: a pool table, a bunch of 3-D printers, computer screens, machining tools, a bunch of prototype drones and some tattooed U.S. airmen working under a wall-mounted banner that read, "Get shit done."
Where was I? I was in one of the most interesting innovations carried out by the U.S. Central Command leader, Gen. Michael "Erik" Kurilla, to extend our staying power. It's the military version of frugal innovation. Centcom challenged itself this way: What if we could fight ISIS, Al Qaeda and Iran only with weapons we had to assemble and make with 3-D printers and we could buy the necessary components only online from Best Buy, Amazon and Alibaba?
In other words, what if we fought with the same economic limitations that our enemies have been managing quite effectively against us since the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- limitations that have led to an asymmetrical battlefield in which we fire $ 1-million-a-copy missiles to knock down the $ 500-a-copy drones they've assembled largely from cheap components available on Best Buy, Amazon and Alibaba.
With this kind of low-cost strategy in mind, the Centcom engineer in charge of the garage explained to me, "we can iterate" new drones and jammers extremely quickly using 3-D printers and carbon fiber materials. And if the United States and its allies are now able to throw 1,000 cheap drones at a foe and that foe doesn't know which one is armed, he explained, "we are imposing costs and creating dilemmas for them and taking their attention away from something else. And by the time they catch on, we're onto the next thing."
This kind of frugal innovation might enable the United States to do less with more in this region. Still, the perception continues that we are leaving, and that is what is creating a lot of movement on the geopolitical game board out here. As a senior Saudi official put it to me: While the Americans are still present in this region, "we're just not sure what they're present for" -- what would trigger them to act in the defense of their allies.
On my last night in Riyadh, Hassan Yassin, a former Saudi diplomat and an old friend, gathered a group for dinner at his home. Hassan is in his 90s and has an amazing picture collection covering his walls. But there was one in particular that he insisted I not miss.
"Did you see the one with my father and President Roosevelt with King Abdul Aziz?" he asked. And then he walked me by the arm to see it.
I thought about that picture and Hassan's pride in it on the ride back to my hotel. America has been deeply present in the lives of Saudi Arabia and Israel since their foundings. I don't know what the right level of U.S. military presence should be out here. I wish we could get by with as little as possible.
But I am totally sure of this: If there was ever a time for America at its best to be out here leading as much with its values as with its hard power, and inspiring, not just defending, it is right now -- when the future characters of the region's two most influential states, and our two most important allies, are totally in play.

Louisiana Bill Requires Parental Consent for Youths' Online Accounts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The measure would allow parents to cancel the contracts underlying their children's accounts on sites like TikTok, Instagram, Roblox and YouTube.
Over the last year, state legislators concerned about a mental health crisis among the nation's young people have passed a raft of children's online safety measures. A new Utah law would require social networks to obtain a parent's consent before giving an account to a child younger than 18 while a new California law would require many sites to turn on the highest privacy settings for minors.
Now Louisiana lawmakers have passed an even broader bill that could affect access to large swaths of the internet for minors in the state.
The Louisiana measure would prohibit online services -- including social networks, multiplayer games and video-sharing apps -- from allowing people under 18 to sign up for accounts without parental consent. It would also allow Louisiana parents to cancel the terms-of-service contracts that their children signed for existing accounts on popular services like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Fortnite and Roblox.
The Louisiana civil code already allows parents to rescind contracts signed by unemancipated minors. Laurie Schlegel, the Republican state legislator who spearheaded the new measure, said her bill simply made it clear that the state's existing contracting rules also covered accounts on online content-sharing platforms.
"This is already the law in Louisiana," Ms. Schlegel said in an email, noting that young people lacked the capacity to understand and agree to the slew of contract terms that online services often require to open an account. "We are just making it clear to some irresponsible online companies who are contracting with minors without parental consent."
On Tuesday, the Louisiana State House passed the bill by a vote of 97 to 0. The State Senate had already passed the measure. The bill now requires approval by Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has not taken a public stance on it. If he signs the bill, it will take effect Aug. 1 next year.
The state bill comes two weeks after the surgeon general issued a public advisory warning Americans that social media posed a serious risk to young people's mental health and urging policymakers to limit access for children. It may be welcomed by many parents worried that their children are being inundated with inappropriate content or spending unhealthy amounts of time online.
TechNet, an industry group whose members include Meta, Snap, Google, Amazon, Apple and Uber, opposed the bill, saying it was overly broad and could cause friction for all users, including adults.
"The bill will require all users to provide proof of their age in order to comply with the law and ask parents to provide proof that they are the minor's parent in order to access the platform," Servando Esparza, TechNet's executive director for Texas and the Southeast, said in an emailed statement. "This could jeopardize privacy and lead to unintended consequences," he added, noting that Louisiana legislators had recently amended the bill to require research on its potential impact before the measure would take effect.
The Louisiana online contracts bill is part of a new wave of state laws this year regulating internet services that could pose risks to young people. And it underscores an escalating effort among Republican state legislators to give families more control over their children's online activities.
Last year, Ms. Schlegel spearheaded the passage of a Louisiana law that requires sexually explicit sites to verify that users in the state are 18 or older by checking credentials like a verified digital driver's license. The law took effect in January.
Since then, at least five states -- Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana,Utah and Virginia -- have passed similar age-verification laws for pornography sites.
In March, Republican lawmakers in Utah initiated the passage of a restrictive social media bill that would require social networks to verify a user's age and obtain parental consent for minors to have accounts. The legislation would also give parents access to their child's online posts and messages. Arkansas enacted a similar measure in April.
In May, the Free Speech Coalition, a group representing adult entertainment sites, sued Utah to try to block the pornography age-verification bill on free speech grounds, saying it violated Americans' rights to view constitutionally protected information.
Civil liberties groups have raised similar concerns about broader child online safety bills, saying the measures could hinder young people from viewing online information.
The new Louisiana bill does not specifically require social media, multiplayer game and other sites and apps to verify the ages of users in the state. And it does not include specific penalties for companies that fail to comply.
Even so, it may cause some online services that currently ask new users to volunteer their birth dates to institute more stringent age-verification and parental-consent procedures.
Like Ms. Schlegel's pornography bill, the new online contracting bill could also be widely copied. Civil codes in many other states have similar rules regarding contracts with minors.
"It is time for big tech to be more responsible to our children online," Ms. Schlegel wrote. "The harm is real."

Full text: The 2021 "short squeeze" of GameStop was a rare victory for the little guy. This documentary explains why the house -- Wall Street wealth, that is -- almost always wins.
If we accept the proposition that having money is sexy, we should also be able to admit that the most aggressive ways of making lots of money -- the banking schemes and strategies that compound the wealth of the already rich -- are not. Are they unfair to the working class? Certainly. Possibly criminal? Sure. But sexy, no. Among the more nefarious activities known to capitalism, big investing is particularly dry.
In "The Big Short," a 2015 fictionalized account of the mid-aughts mortgage-market collapse, the director Adam McKay attempted to skirt this dynamic by having attractive performers including Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez explain the details of market manipulation. In the new documentary "Apes Together Strong," the filmmakers (and twin brothers) Finley Mulligan and Quinn Mulligan, working with a microbudget and no access to movie stars, detail how to short-sell a stock with a rough-hewed sketch involving a bag of sugar that is borrowed, sold and re-bought at a profit -- or not.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The title of the movie is the motto of the talking simians in the latter-day "Planet of the Apes" film franchise; it was adopted by the retail investors who led the GameStop "short squeeze" of 2021. At that time, small investors succeeded in significantly raising the price of stock in GameStop, a store chain targeted by hedge funds for market assassination.
In a fast-paced style derived from Michael Moore or Morgen Spurlock, the Mulligans interview retail-investor comrades and banking pros sympathetic to the small investors' cause. The villains, both past and present -- the Reagan White House with its push to deregulate banking; big finance honchos; hedge fund vultures -- are seen in archival footage, mostly.
The lessons here are old, and at one point, the filmmakers use the phrase "the house always wins." But there's hope, because there's always hope in such tales. While Dennis M. Kelleher, the chief executive of the nonprofit investor's advocacy group Better Markets, says, "Wall Street wins largely because they are unopposed," the movie closes on a rallying cry.

GameStop Fires Its Chief After Revenue Slips Again
GameStop fired its chief executive, Matt Furlong, on Wednesday, two years after hiring him, and appointed the billionaire businessman Ryan Cohen as executive chairman, sending the company's shares down 20 percent in extended trading.
A former executive at Amazon, Mr. Furlong joined GameStop in 2021, just months after the company was at the center of a meme-stock trading frenzy in which social media-armed traders talked up the value of the stock.
The video game retailer also said it would not be holding an earnings call.
Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet products retailer Chewy, has been serving as chairman of GameStop since 2021 and is also a majority shareholder.
GameStop posted its fourth consecutive fall in quarterly revenue and missed market estimates, as consumers dialed back non-essential spending in an uncertain economy. REUTERS
COMPANIES
Gloomy Investors Send Campbell Shares Lower
Shares in Campbell Soup dropped as much as 9 percent on Wednesday after the company disappointed investors by maintaining its full-year forecasts for sales and profit despite beating quarterly earnings.
Packaged food companies likeCampbell, Kraft Heinz and Kellogg have been raising prices to counter the impact of higher input costs stemming from supply chain snags and the Russia-Ukraine war.
The move helped Campbell Soup post a 5 percent rise in quarterly sales, although its margins slipped to 30 percent from 31.2 percent.
Investors are likely disappointed with the company keeping its forecast unchanged as they were anticipating a raise, said Arun Sundaram, an analyst for CFRA Research, but he added that the decision reflected a "prudent level of conservatism."
Campbell expects annual net sales to grow between 8.5 percent and 10 percent, compared with analysts' estimates for a rise of 9.5 percent, according to Refinitiv IBES data. REUTERS
SPIRITS
Maker of Jack Daniel's Tops Sales Estimates
Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel's whiskey, topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales on Wednesday, benefiting from higher prices as well as steady demand for its liquor brands.
Shares of the company, which also produces Woodford Reserve bourbon and el Jimador tequila, rose more than 3 percent by the close of trading.
Spirit makers have raised prices globally as they try to protect their margins from increased costs and a stronger U.S. dollar.
Brown-Forman's revenue rose 5 percent to $ 1.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended April 30, beating analysts' average estimate of $ 990.3 million, according to Refinitiv data.
However, despite multiple price hikes, the company grappled with higher expenses linked to supply chain, raw materials, and packaging, pushing its gross margin to 60.8 percent, from 62.8 percent a year earlier. REUTERS

Losses in Tech Stocks Overshadow Gains: [List]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish Wednesday, as drops for Microsoft and other big-name tech stocks overshadowed gains across much of the rest of Wall Street.
The Standard & Poors 500- stock index fell 16.33, or 0.4 percent, to 4,267.52 even though the majority of stocks within the index rose. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 91.74, or 0.3 percent, to 33,665.02, while the Nasdaq composite fell 171.52, or 1.3 percent, to 13,104.89.
Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Alphabet all sank at least 3 percent and were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Because they're some of Wall Street's most valuable stocks, their movements pack extra punch on the index.
It's a reversal from much of this year, where a narrow group of high-growth stocks led the way on hopes for easier interest rates from the Federal Reserve and excitement around artificial intelligence. But tech stocks are seen as some of the hardest hit by higher interest rates, and yields were on the rise in the Treasury market.
Yields climbed after the Bank of Canada raised its policy interest rates on Wednesday, surprising some investors after it had left rates steady since January. The Fed will make its own decision on rates next week.
Campbell Soup, meanwhile, sank 8.9 percent after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. It also gave a forecast for earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations, as price increases push some customers to buy less.
But much of the rest of the market rose as the gains on Wall Street broaden out some. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 1.8 percent to continue its hot streak since a stronger-than-expected report on hiring last week suggested a recession may be further off than feared.
On the winning side of Wall Street was Dave & Buster's, which jumped 18.3 percent after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected.
Brown-Forman rose 4 percent after the spirits company reported stronger profit than expected for the latest quarter, thanks in part to growth for its Woodford Reserve brand.
The market in general has climbed for months thanks to a resilient economy that's managed to defy predictions for a recession. But the threat still looms, and Wall Street is questioning which will come first: a recession or inflation falling enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates?
That's why much of Wall Street's focus is on next week. The U.S. government is scheduled to release the monthly updates on inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels. The Federal Reserve will also announce its latest move on interest rates Thursday.
The dominant expectation among traders is for the Fed to leave rates steady next week.
That's key because the goal of high interest rates is to corral high inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. The Fed has hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate to the highest level since 2007.
Pressure from high rates have already caused cracks in the U.S. banking and manufacturing industries, though the job market has remained remarkably solid.
One expected boost to the global economy has not come through, which has added to the pressure. In China, trade data pointed to a further slowing of the world's second-largest economy.
China reported its exports fell 7.5 percent from a year earlier in May and imports were down 4.5 percent, adding to signs of a slowing of its economic recovery.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78 percent from 3.68 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.55 percent from 4.50 percent.

Very Smart, Very Rich And Getting Very Tough: [Correction]

Full text: It's been a tough run for Meta, and the boss seems to be getting out some aggression with military-style endurance routines and Brazilian jujitsu.
Close your eyes. Picture Mark Zuckerberg. What do you see?
Perhaps you envision the Meta boss and Facebook founder in a gray T-shirt, spotlighted on a Silicon Valley stage. Maybe his cartoonish metaverse avatar hovers before you -- with legs, or without them. Possibly Jesse Eisenberg, the bony actor who played the fledgling tycoon in "The Social Network" (2010), appears in your mind's eye.
But it's unlikely you conjure anything like the image Mr. Zuckerberg posted to Instagram (which Meta owns) and Facebook on Monday.
The mirror selfie shows the social-media billionaire wearing a camouflage flak jacket while glistening faintly with sweat. His neck swells wider than his jaw. His shoulders are capped with muscle. His forearms bulge.
He looks -- to use a scientific term -- completely shredded. He also looks completely focused, like a guy in a Michael Bay movie who just finished a dangerous mission, or at least the Raya profile picture of the actor who plays that guy.
Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a caption that he had just done the Murph Challenge, a Memorial Day workout and fund-raiser named for the Navy SEAL officer Michael P. Murphy, who died in Afghanistan in 2005. The challenge consists of a mile run, followed by 100 pull-ups, followed by 200 push-ups, followed by 300 squats, capped off with another mile run, all while wearing a 20-pound vest.
Just as eye popping as Mr. Zuckerberg's arms was the time he said the brutal routine took him: under 40 minutes. That's an elite time according to Dr. Joshua Appel, the Veterans Affairs physician who helped popularize the workout, which has become a staple in CrossFit gyms.
So when, exactly, did Zuck decide to go Rambo? And why?
Mr. Zuckerberg did not respond to a request for comment about his physical fitness.
"He looks great," said Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist, former Facebook vice president and longtime friend of Mr. Zuckerberg's. "But I don't think he's doing it for looks. I think he's doing it because he's really into jujitsu." (Though Mr. Zuckerberg's photo suggests that he may be feeling himself, at least a little.)
That would be Brazilian jujitsu, the grueling grappling-based combat sport that is a fundamental part of mixed martial arts. In an August 2022 appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Mr. Zuckerberg said that he had taken up martial arts during the pandemic, training with Dave Camarillo, a well-known coach in the Bay Area.
"The crazy thing is it really is the best sport," Mr. Zuckerberg told Mr. Rogan at the time. "There's something that's just so primal about it." (Mr. Rogan is a martial arts enthusiast and Ultimate Fighting Championship commentator.)
According to Casey Johnston, a cultural critic who writes frequently about exercise and strength training in her newsletter She's a Beast, sports like Brazilian jujitsu appeal to a desire among Silicon Valley types to reconnect with a primitive fighting spirit, but on their own, highly formalized terms.
"It's like being on a playground with a bully but in this new framework," she said. "It's not quite choreographed but the stakes and the rules are unambiguous."
On May 6, Mr. Zuckerberg competed in his first Brazilian jujitsu event, in Woodside, Calif., where he defeated an Uber engineer and won two medals, and lost consciousness. José Lucas Costa da Silva, a veteran Brazilian jujitsu fighter who refereed one of Mr. Zuckerberg's matches, said that he halted the bout after he heard Mr. Zuckerberg start to snore, a sign of someone who has passed out in a choke hold.
"This is something we are trained to know," said Mr. Costa da Silva, who added that Mr. Zuckerberg was a good sport who was "enjoying the moment."
After this article was published Friday afternoon, both Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Camarillo reached out and said that the Meta boss had not lost consciousness.
"That never happened," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in an email. According to Mr. Camarillo, Mr. Costa da Silva mistook his student's effortful grunting for snores.
"This was his first tournament, but it didn't seem like it," said Danny Patalot, the chief executive of BJJ Tour, which organized the daylong event at a local high school. "He was aggressive using technique. There was no fear. That's not typical for a white belt competitor at a first tournament."
For Mr. Zuckerberg, who has absorbed a number of metaphorical body blows over the past several years -- including an election meddling scandal, a ghost town metaverse and widespread layoffs -- it is perhaps a revealing time to start fighting back.
Mr. Zuckerberg is, of course, not the first tech titan to add significant amounts of muscle. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, has, in his 50s, developed remarkable biceps, linebacker shoulders and impressive vascularity. But some of Mr. Zuckerberg's friends say the new regimen is not exactly a surprise.
Though Mr. Zuckerberg entered the popular imagination as an indoor cat -- the millennial archnerd outsmarting the strapping regatta princes of Harvard -- the 39-year-old has been devoted to physical activity for much of his life. He was the captain of his prep school fencing team and became an avid runner in the 2010s.
According to Mr. Lessin, Mr. Zuckerberg goes through phases with new sports, including roller hockey and surfing, a hobby that was immortalized in an image of the magnate afloat in Hawaii, a haunting mask of sunscreen slathered on his face.
"He sees them as super-fun side quests," Mr. Lessin said.
Famously competitive, Mr. Zuckerberg is the "great physical instigator" of his friend group, Mr. Lessin said, and frequently proposes physical challenges. "We've been on trips where he'll say, like, 'I'll race you up that mountain."' And on Mr. Rogan's podcast, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he had successfully encouraged many of his friends to train in Brazilian jujitsu with him.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg has a passion for benchmarking. In April, he posted a photo of a stopwatch appearing to confirm that he had run five kilometers in under 20 minutes. And though many commenters were skeptical of his Murph Challenge time, Mr. Zuckerberg clarified that he had done a special, easier-but-still-painful version, in which the exercises are performed in circuits.
Also performing a modified version of the Murph challenge: Two of Mr. Zuckerberg's three daughters. He posted a picture of the girls mid-push-up, in the midst of a "quarter-Murph (unweighted)" -- a clarification that the children were not wearing flak jackets.

Bear Market Nears an End As Bulls Lurk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The S&P 500 ended the day nearly 20 percent above its low last year, within a hair of a milestone for some market watchers. But assessing a bona fide bull market is not so simple.
The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.
The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.
Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market -- which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index's high -- in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.
The terms "bull" and "bear" are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there's less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.
One rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.
But some investors say it's simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $ 15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.
"We're not in a horrible spot," said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale. "There are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market."
Still, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market's direction.
"If a stock goes from $ 10 to $ 5 and then rallies to $ 6, it's not in a new bull market," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. "Defining a bull or bear market, however it's done, should be done via a broad look at the market."
The recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year -- gains that have brought its valuation close to $ 1 trillion.
The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday's close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index's rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.
The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.
In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.
"I think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow," said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Unfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal."
For many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven't been reflected in their portfolios' performance. That's because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.
Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.
Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
"Everyone has been so defensive," said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. "There is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers."

Full text: In internal forecasts, the company projected that ad sales would keep declining, handing a tough challenge to its new chief executive.
Elon Musk recently said Twitter's advertising business was on the upswing. "Almost all advertisers have come back," he asserted, adding that the social media company could soon become profitable.
But Twitter's U.S. advertising revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $ 88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier, according to an internal presentation obtained by The New York Times. The company has regularly fallen short of its U.S. weekly sales projections, sometimes by as much as 30 percent, the document said.
That performance is unlikely to improve anytime soon, according to the documents and seven current and former Twitter employees.
Twitter's ad sales staff is concerned that advertisers may be spooked by a rise in hate speech and pornography on the social network, as well as more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products, the people said. The company has forecast that its U.S. ad revenue this month will be down at least 56 percent each week compared with a year ago, according to one internal document.
These issues have been inherited by Linda Yaccarino, the NBCUniversal executive whom Mr. Musk named Twitter's chief executive last month. She started her new job on Monday.
On a Twitter Space audio event on Monday, Mr. Musk said advertisers in Europe and North America have put "extreme pressure" on the company, leading "half our advertising" to disappear. "They are trying to drive Twitter bankrupt," he said.
He did not respond to a request for comment and Ms. Yaccarino, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
The state of Twitter's advertising is crucial because ads have long made up 90 percent of the company's revenue. After Mr. Musk bought Twitter for $ 44 billion in October and took the company private, he vowed to build "the most respected ad platform." But he quickly alienated advertisers by firing key sales executives, spreading a conspiracy theory on the site and welcoming back barred Twitter users.
In response, several large ad agencies and brands, including General Motors and Volkswagen, paused their ad spending on Twitter. Mr. Musk has said Twitter was on track to post $ 3 billion in revenue in 2023, down from $ 5.1 billion in 2021, when it was a public company.
Twitter's valuation has since plunged. In March, Mr. Musk said the company was worth $ 20 billion, down more than 50 percent from the $ 44 billion he paid for it. Last week, the mutual funds giant Fidelity, which owns shares in Twitter, valued the company at $ 15 billion.
Twitter feels increasingly "unpredictable and chaotic," said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, an association for premium publishers. "Advertisers want to run in an environment where they are comfortable and can send a signal about their brand," he added.
Some of Twitter's biggest advertisers -- including Apple, Amazon and Disney -- have been spending less on the platform than last year, three former and current Twitter employees said. Large specialized "banner" ads on Twitter's trends page, which can cost $ 500,000 for 24 hours and are almost always bought by large brands to promote events, shows or movies, are often going unfilled, they said.
Twitter has also run into public relations snafus with big advertisers like Disney. In April, Twitter mistakenly gave a gold check mark -- a badge meant to signify a paying advertiser -- to the @DisneyJuniorUK account, which Disney doesn't own. The account posted racial slurs, leading Disney officials to demand from Twitter an explanation and assurances that it wouldn't happen again, two people with knowledge of the situation said.
Disney, Apple and Amazon declined to comment.
Six ad agency executives who have worked with Twitter said their clients continued to limit spending on the platform. They cited confusion over Mr. Musk's changes to the service, inconsistent support from Twitter and concerns about the persistent presence of misleading and toxic content on the platform.
Last month, for instance, a picture that appeared to show an explosion near the Pentagon -- which artificial intelligence experts identified as a synthetically generated image -- was shared by dozens of Twitter accounts and briefly caused the stock market to tumble.
Some advertisers also continue to worry about Mr. Musk's tweets. Last month, he posted several times comparing the billionaire financier George Soros, a frequent target for conspiracy theorists, to the "X-Men" comic book villain Magneto. Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, noted that both Mr. Soros and Magneto are Holocaust survivors, and that "the lie Jews want to destroy civilization has led to the persecution of Jewish people for centuries."
"Musk should know better," he said.
Last week, Ella Irwin, Twitter's head of trust and safety, the division that oversees content moderation, and AJ Brown, the head of brand safety and ad quality, resigned, three current and former employees said. Ms. Irwin and Mr. Brown did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Musk has promoted new tools, known as adjacency controls, so advertisers can keep their ads away from tweets containing specific keywords or posts by certain users. Some advertisers are using the tools to keep their content away from Mr. Musk's tweets, four people familiar with the situation said.
Still, some marketers are returning to the platform. GroupM, a media-buying organization that is part of the ad giant WPP, informed employees in May that it was removing its "high risk" flag on Twitter and guiding clients to return, at their discretion, to business as usual, two people familiar with the decision said. IPG, another large advertising company, has recommended that clients proceed with caution when dealing with Twitter, after suggesting last fall that they temporarily pause their spending.
Twitter is exploring ways to make it easier for advertisers to buy space on the platform, testing an automated system outside the United States to make deals, two people familiar with the arrangement said. Insider earlier reported the move.
The company is experiencing ad growth in areas that it once shied away from or prohibited, including online gambling and marijuana products. In one week last month, four of Twitter's top 10 U.S. advertisers were online gambling and fantasy sports betting companies, according to one presentation. Twitter has also started allowing ads for cannabis accessories, including "bongs, vapes, rolling paper," as well as erectile dysfunction products and services, according to internal emails.
Adult content, which is permitted on Twitter, has become a concern among the company's sales staff. When some employees tried to drum up interest from advertisers for Mother's Day, they found that potential sponsored search terms, like "MomLife," surfaced pornographic videos, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
These are issues that some advertisers hope Ms. Yaccarino will solve.
Dave Campanelli, the chief investment officer of Horizon Media, said he was hoping for change after Ms. Yaccarino started, because media agencies like his struggled to maintain contact with Twitter last fall after Mr. Musk arrived.
"For a period, we weren't even sure who to get on the phone with to talk to," he said. "With Linda coming in, that could change that in a big way."
He acknowledged that Twitter's mercurial boss and volatile environment might pose a challenge for Ms. Yaccarino.
"It's a tall order," Mr. Campanelli said.

Full text: Average office occupancy rate, compared with prepandemic levels, across major U.S. cities.
Cubicles sit empty, printers gather dust, and office pantries wait for the one day a week when their workers might actually come in, craving the company of their teammates.
More than three years since Covid arrived and upended the workplace, many forms of social life have bounced back to nearly their prepandemic levels. Air travel at the end of 2022 was almost back to where it was in 2019. But many offices remain stubbornly quiet, even as executives roll out perks to entice employees to return, offering elaborate free lunches and company-branded swag.
Some workers say they prepared too many times for return-to-office dates that never came to pass. And when they did, many employees were already attached to the habits they had formed while working from home, like homemade lunches and zero-minute commutes. They don't want to return to their offices only to sit on video calls with colleagues who are still working from home. Some workers, like those at Amazon, are outright protesting return-to-office rules.
Business leaders have often found that the best way to fill the office is to remind employees of its social promise. It turns out people enjoy spending time with co-workers more than they remember -- which could mean a more coordinated approach to R.T.O., like bringing workers back on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (the most popular office days, according to data from the security firm Kastle).
"They actually forgot how great it was to actually interact with human beings," said Sasan Godarzi, the head of Intuit, which has allowed teams and managers to set return-to-office expectations.
But even if the biggest R.T.O. perk is the people, that still requires figuring out how to get all of them to come back.

Jeff Zucker Just Won't Let CNN Go Already: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The seminar was to be on media leadership. Dozens of students filling a classroom at Yale University in April were there to learn about the business from a man who had commanded attention in TV control rooms and corporate boardrooms for decades before a stunning exit last year.
What they got was remarkable candor about that exit.
Jeff Zucker, who had been president of CNN for nine years, told the group that he believed the network's former owners used his relationship with Allison Gollust -- who was also in attendance -- as a pretext for removing him, three people familiar with his comments said.
In front of the students -- where other high-profile media executives, including Bob Iger of Disney, were scheduled to speak the same day -- Mr. Zucker compared his failure to disclose his relationship with Ms. Gollust, CNN's former communications chief, to handing over a dangerous weapon.
"I gave them a gun, and they shot me with it," Mr. Zucker said, according to the people.
That Mr. Zucker would compare his forced departure to a gunshot wound underscores the depth of his frustration with his last days at a network he controlled with exacting detail for years.
The complaint wasn't unusual for Mr. Zucker, 58. He often compares notes on the media business with former colleagues and industry acquaintances, many of whom call him to grouse about the current state of CNN.
But his gripes have become more frequent of late, and he has made no secret of his unhappiness with the terms of his exit from CNN or his low regard for the performance of its current leader, Chris Licht. In a sense, he is now serving as a kind of grievance switchboard for current and former employees of the news network, many people who have spoken with him said.
Mr. Zucker's criticism may be painful for executives running CNN to hear second- and thirdhand. But also painful are the numbers: The news division, which once regularly made more than $ 1 billion in profit annually, generated just $ 750 million in profit last year. And its ratings were down more than 30 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same point in the 2020 presidential election cycle, when Donald J. Trump -- a major driver of cable news viewership -- was still in the White House, according to Nielsen data.
As it has geared up to cover the 2024 campaign, the network has committed some unforced errors. Last month, CNN hosted a town hall with Mr. Trump in New Hampshire that was criticized for airing false information. Mr. Licht's leadership and problems at the helm of the network were dissected at length in a 15,000-word Atlantic article that was published Friday.
Many anchors Mr. Zucker hired or promoted, including Jake Tapper, and Kaitlan Collins, who moderated the town hall, are still in prominent spots in CNN's lineup. But he has found himself banished from the control room during a major news cycle, including an indictment of former President Trump and the opening acts of the 2024 presidential election.
He has not been hiding away, though. He and Ms. Gollust traveled to Las Vegas to see a Taylor Swift concert, and last month he attended the Sports Emmy Awards at the invitation of Bryant Gumbel, along with the former "Today" anchor Matt Lauer. His new office in Manhattan -- where a life-size statue of the Incredible Hulk looms in the entryway -- is just blocks from CNN's former New York headquarters in Columbus Circle.
And he is trying to get his next act off the ground, starting a new venture called RedBird IMI with $ 1 billion to spend on acquisitions in the digital media, sports, entertainment and news industries.
This article on Mr. Zucker is based on interviews with more than four dozen of his associates in the media industry who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their relationship with him. He declined to comment, but through a spokeswoman described his attitude toward CNN.
"It is wholly unsurprising that Jeff Zucker, the architect of CNN's unprecedented success, would have deep misgivings about the direction the network has taken since he left," said Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Zucker. She added that it was also no surprise "that he gets asked a lot, publicly and privately, and regularly from former colleagues, about what he thinks of CNN now."
Months after he left CNN in February 2022, Mr. Zucker met with his successor, Mr. Licht. The organizers of that meeting -- industry confederates who know both men -- hoped that a lunch at Mr. Zucker's house on Amagansett's tony Hedges Lane would clear the air.
Mr. Zucker had been privately critical of Mr. Licht's leadership of CNN, according to people who have spoken with him, and the two men hadn't met since Mr. Zucker was pushed out.
The get-together didn't kindle much bonhomie between the media executives, who had been friendly in the clubby world of TV news. Mr. Licht was seeking a rapprochement. Mr. Zucker was asked to give advice. But afterward, the former CNN president griped that Mr. Licht didn't take any of his pointers, said a person familiar with his feelings following the meal.
"This is all very sad for Jeff," said Kenneth Lerer, the co-founder of HuffPost and former chairman of BuzzFeed. "He should move on with his life. It's disheartening to see."
Mr. Lerer has a distinct perspective on the situation: He is a close friend of David Zaslav, the chief executive of CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, and was once also friendly with Mr. Zucker.
Mr. Zucker's criticism has rankled executives of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, according to people familiar with their thinking. They suspect Mr. Zucker has leaked unflattering information about the network's operations to the press.
He has also been candid about what he sees as the missteps of CNN's former parent company, AT&T, and its leaders, including the former WarnerMedia chief executive Jason Kilar, many industry acquaintances who have spoken with Mr. Zucker in recent months say.
Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery believe Mr. Zucker is waging a proxy war against Mr. Licht, undermining his leadership from afar, according to three people familiar with their thinking.
Mr. Zucker's criticisms have come at a particularly inopportune time for Warner Bros. Discovery, which was created last year from the fusion of WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company at the time, and Discovery, the home of "Dr. Pimple Popper" and "90 Day Fiancé" and is still trying to get CNN onto solid footing.
A spokesman for Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement that the company was confident in the direction of the network and in Mr. Licht's leadership of it. "We set a high bar for ourselves and while we know that it will take time to complete the important work that's underway, we have great confidence in the progress that Chris and the team are making and share their conviction in the strategy," the statement said.
Underlying the grievances are tensions between Mr. Zucker and Mr. Zaslav, who picked Mr. Licht to succeed Mr. Zucker at the top of CNN. Once great friends and business allies -- and a regular pair at the East Hampton Golf Club -- the two men have grown apart since Mr. Zucker's ouster, people familiar with their relationship say.
In March, Mr. Zaslav visited CNN's Manhattan headquarters and criticized Mr. Zucker's leadership of the network in a meeting with Mr. Licht's lieutenants, according to someone at Warner Bros. Discovery. In the meeting, Mr. Zaslav told CNN executives that Mr. Zucker's gripes -- which had made their way to him -- were ironic, given that Mr. Zucker had once remarked that Mr. Licht was the one executive who could do the job if he ever left the network.
Since he took over CNN's parent company, Mr. Zaslav has fired back, telling employees in a private meeting that there was a "period of time" when it became an "advocacy network," a not-so-subtle dig at segments that were stridently critical of President Trump, who drove massive ratings. Mr. Zucker disagrees with that characterization, people who have spoken with him say, believing that on his watch the network's policy of calling out Mr. Trump's falsehoods led to journalistic and financial success.
In another gathering this spring, Mr. Zucker said that his departure from CNN was the hardest period in his life, adding that the episode made his bond with Ms. Gollust stronger, according to a person familiar with his remarks. He also said that the punishment he received didn't fit the crime.
When Mr. Zucker was forced out of CNN last year, he and the network's parent company negotiated over a statement designating his failure to disclose his relationship with Ms. Gollust as the reason for his exit. "I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong," Mr. Zucker wrote in a memo to employees at the time.
According to two people familiar with Mr. Zucker's departure from CNN, a company investigation into his conduct by the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore found multiple violations of CNN's standards and practices, including taking part in advising former New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Ms. Heller, Mr. Zucker's spokeswoman, said Mr. Zucker did not advise Mr. Cuomo.
"As we have said numerous times, Mr. Zucker never advised Andrew Cuomo, directly or indirectly," she said. "He was asked to resign for one reason only, failure to disclose his relationship."
For Mr. Zucker, who has been in senior management ranks since his 20s, when he became executive producer of "Today," his abrupt exit from CNN represented a marked change of pace. He soon began to explore his options, gravitating to the familiar territories of sports and media. Years ago, Mr. Zucker told a writer for the Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper he worked on as an undergraduate, that he hadn't taken a day off since finishing college.
Shortly after his ouster from CNN, Mr. Zucker began plotting his next move, meeting with advisers, former colleagues and industry stalwarts at upscale watering holes like the Core Club in New York and the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. But even as he planned for the future, Mr. Zucker was thinking about his past.
In the summer, he traveled to Jackson Hole, in Wyoming, for an off-the-record gathering of media executives. In a fireside chat at the event, he was asked for his view on the current direction of CNN and in his answer criticized Mr. Kilar for the way the executive handled his exit, according to two people familiar with his remarks.
In his new endeavor, the investment vehicle Redbird IMI, he has told confidants he is interested in building a company that owns digital publications targeted at specific audiences, similar to Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker. He has held talks with owners of digital-media start-ups, but those conversations haven't yet resulted in a deal. He is now one of at least three suitors exploring a deal to take a majority stake in Air Mail, the media company founded by the former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter.
In recent months, he has also met with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, according to three people familiar with their conversation.
One company Mr. Zucker is not in talks to acquire is CNN, according to people familiar with his plans. Though he has told some associates he would be interested in acquiring the network should it come up for sale one day, he has lamented to others that CNN's current owners, Warner Bros. Discovery, have damaged the network so much through cost-cutting that he wouldn't be interested in owning it.
But Mr. Zucker has explored a deal for the network before. In late 2020, he and Andrew Morse, CNN's former digital chief, met with Emerson Collective, the umbrella company founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, and had preliminary conversations about a potential spinout of the network. Without informing Mr. Kilar, his boss at the time, Mr. Zucker referred Emerson Collective's interest to an executive at AT&T. The deal never happened, and AT&T ultimately turned to Discovery.
There are signs that Mr. Zucker believes he could once again be calling the shots at a media organization. He has told associates that he's open to an operational role at one of the companies he buys, and many of his confidantes believe he could still land another big corporate job.
A professional revival for Mr. Zucker has some precedent. After he was fired as chief executive of NBCUniversal in 2010, Mr. Zucker created a new daytime show for Disney with the former "Today" host Katie Couric that he called a "tremendous opportunity."
Then he got the CNN job. "Katie" was off the air two years later.

A Lesbian Comic Strip Returns in a New Era: [Style Desk]

Full text: The long-running comic strip by Alison Bechdel, the creator of "Fun Home," first held up a mirror to its queer readership in 1983. So what does a new audio adaptation have to say to listeners today?
Over the past few weeks, Mallory Pearson, a 26-year-old writer and graphic designer living in Brooklyn, and her roommate, a tattoo artist, have been reading through Alison Bechdel's beloved comic "Dykes to Watch Out For." The series, which ran from 1983 to 2008, rings true as ever to the pair.
"We read something together, literally the other day, and were laughing about how accurate it is," Ms. Pearson said. They read jokes about feeling unprepared for a date, and story lines about the insularity of lesbian friend groups. "Seeing how that hasn't changed at all is hilarious to me," she added.
On Thursday, "Dykes to Watch Out For" was reborn in a surprising medium: an audio series from Audible, adapted by the playwright Madeleine George. Carrie Brownstein plays the verbose polemicist Mo, and Roberta Colindrez voices Lois, a full-time flirt. They're joined by others, including Roxane Gay, as Jezanna, and Jane Lynch, who narrates the series.
This month marks 40 years since Ms. Bechdel published the first "Dykes to Watch Out For" strip in Woman News. It ran weekly and was famous for its characters' political engagement and outraged responses to the news of the day. Ms. Bechdel has called her strip "half op-ed column and half endless, serialized Victorian novel." Social commentary and political analysis are, by nature, products of their time. So how does "Dykes to Watch Out For" speak to contemporary queer culture decades later? And who wants to listen?
Fans of the comic when it first emerged are curious to revisit a work that they felt so astutely captured their lives. Lisa Casey, 50, a marketing agency project manager in Portland, Ore., was living in San Francisco when she read the comic as it was published. "My friends and I would grab the newspaper and read it in the back of bookstores," Ms. Casey said. "My memory of it was really looking at it as a vision of what my life might become. It was a more grown-up vision of queer life."
When Ms. Casey first started dating her partner, Brie Stoianoff, in 2017, she gave Ms. Stoianoff a copy of "Dykes to Watch Out For" as an early gift. Ms. Stoianoff, 45, an account executive at a medical-device company, came out in her late 30s. "I just wish I had found 'Dykes to Watch Out For' in my 20s," Ms. Stoianoff said. "It probably would have changed the whole trajectory of my life, by normalizing gay relationships."
When she and Ms. Casey heard about the audio version, they were immediately interested. "I'm incredibly excited because I'm just curious about how they do it," Ms. Stoianoff said. "What are their voices going to be like?"
Others resist the new format. Avery Rose, 31, a handyman passing through Brooklyn for a few weeks, has always had an interest in reading the comics but is skeptical about the new medium. "I like audiobooks, but I find the fiction audio really cheesy," Mx. Rose said. "It's hard for it not to be cringey."
In adapting the series -- which Ms. George first read on the recommendation of a college boyfriend who thought she might like it -- the playwright aimed to retain Ms. Bechdel's dialogue over all else.
"My first Hippocratic oath was: Do no harm to the strip," she said. After retaining the spirit of the characters, Ms. George went on a hunt for audio cues. She gathered music by Joan Jett and Cris Williamson, as well as audio from protests featured in the comic, including sound from the 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, where the AIDS Memorial Quilt was first displayed. "I think it's a highlight of this series that we got actual audio footage," Ms. George said.
The success of the musical adaptation of Ms. Bechdel's graphic novel "Fun Home" has opened other fans' eyes to the living, breathing qualities of her other work. KD Diamond, 38, is a tattoo artist and illustrator in Los Angeles who has even done Bechdel-themed tattoos. Ms. Diamond grew up hiding Ms. Bechdel's comics inside other books while at Barnes & Noble with her family. She was unbothered about the jump from page to headphones, saying the comic's "rich characters" would be able to sustain an audio series. "The cast is going to be amazing," she said.
Grace Burke, 23, the manager of Little District Books in Washington, D.C., said that they liked "the accessibility aspect," noting that an audio adaptation would bring the work to people who couldn't interact with visuals. But Mx. Burke has other concerns about the adaptation. "Audible is owned by Amazon," they said. "I don't really mess with Amazon. I think that a lot of queer people relate to that. The types of people who likely engage with Alison Bechdel aren't the types of people who love Amazon and support it unless they have to."
Madden Aleia, 24, also runs a bookstore: Bookends in Northampton, Mass., which hosts a regular queer gathering called Dykes to Hang Out With. "As someone who spends an inordinate amount of time overhearing lesbian conversations, I think that there's something very valuable about representing the conversations of queers," Ms. Aleia said of the audio adaptation.
Ms. Aleia said she appreciated "Dykes to Watch Out For" as a rare work about queer people that doesn't feel a need to explain itself to a heteronormative world. Instead, it spends its time making jokes about psychotherapy, lusting after crushes and rigorously engaging in politics. As Ms. Aleia described it: "We're here, we're queer and we're neurotic about it!"
Ms. Aleia said she regularly sells the comic to people in their early 20s to people in their 50s. According to Mx. Burke, the Little District Books manager, Ms. Bechdel's work is some of the most popular in the store.
For her part, Ms. Bechdel said she was initially both skeptical about and eager to hear the audio translation. But sitting in the audio booth when the actors came to record, she said, she was immediately thrilled. "To hear Carrie Brownstein really nail the most lengthy, polysyllabic rants was very satisfying," Ms. Bechdel said. "And Roberta Colindrez as Lois is just a dream. I feel almost like I was channeling her from the future, when I wrote that character 40 years ago."
Ms. Bechdel said she was amazed that the strip appeals to so many younger readers. "I'm really grateful," she said. Still, it's a bittersweet alliance, hearing from readers who are dealing with the same issues and aggravations that her generation faced.
"In some ways," she added, "it's sort of sad that with all the progress we've had, some things are still the same."

The seminar was to be on media leadership. Dozens of students filling a classroom at Yale University in April were there to learn about the business from a man who had commanded attention in TV control rooms and corporate boardrooms for decades before a stunning exit last year.
What they got was remarkable candor about that exit.
Jeff Zucker, who had been president of CNN for nine years, told the group that he believed the network’s former owners used his relationship with Allison Gollust — who was also in attendance — as a pretext for removing him, three people familiar with his comments said.
In front of the students — where other high-profile media executives, including Bob Iger of Disney, were scheduled to speak the same day — Zucker compared his failure to disclose his relationship with Gollust, CNN’s former communications chief, with handing over a dangerous weapon.
“I gave them a gun, and they shot me with it,” Zucker said, according to the people.
That Zucker would compare his forced departure with a gunshot wound underscores the depth of his frustration with his last days at a network he controlled with exacting detail for years.
The complaint wasn’t unusual for Zucker, 58. He often compares notes on the media business with former colleagues and industry acquaintances, many of whom call him to discuss the current state of CNN.
But his gripes have become more frequent of late, and he has made no secret of his unhappiness with the terms of his exit from CNN or his low regard for the performance of its current leader, Chris Licht. In a sense, he is now serving as a kind of grievance switchboard for current and former employees of the news network, many people who have spoken with him said.
Zucker’s criticism may be painful for executives running CNN to hear secondhand and thirdhand. But also painful are the numbers: The news division, which once regularly made more than $1 billion in profit annually, generated $750 million in profit last year. And its ratings were down more than 30% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same point in the 2020 presidential election cycle, when Donald Trump — a major driver of cable news viewership — was still in the White House, according to Nielsen data.
Many anchors Zucker hired or promoted, including Kaitlan Collins, are in prominent spots in CNN’s lineup, but he has found himself banished from the control room during a major news cycle, including an indictment of Trump and the opening acts of the 2024 presidential election.
He has not been hiding away, though. He and Gollust traveled to Las Vegas for a Taylor Swift concert, and last month he attended the Sports Emmy Awards at the invitation of Bryant Gumbel, along with former “Today” anchor Matt Lauer. His new office in midtown Manhattan — where a life-size statue of the Incredible Hulk looms in the entryway — is just blocks from CNN’s former New York headquarters in Columbus Circle.
And he is trying to get his next act off the ground: starting a new venture called RedBird IMI with $1 billion to spend on acquisitions in the digital media, sports, entertainment and news industries.
This article on Zucker is based on interviews with more than four dozen of his associates in the media industry who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their relationship with him. He declined to comment, but through a spokesperson described his attitude toward CNN.
“It is wholly unsurprising that Jeff Zucker, the architect of CNN’s unprecedented success, would have deep misgivings about the direction the network has taken since he left,” said Risa Heller, a spokesperson for Zucker. She added that it was also no surprise “that he gets asked a lot, publicly and privately and regularly, from former colleagues about what he thinks of CNN now.”
Months after he left CNN in February 2022, Zucker met with his successor, Licht. The organizers of that meeting — industry confederates who know both men — hoped that a lunch at Zucker’s house on Long Island would clear the air.
Zucker had been privately critical of Licht’s leadership of CNN, according to people who have spoken with him, and the two men hadn’t met since Zucker was pushed out.
The get-together didn’t kindle much bonhomie between the media executives, who had been friendly in the clubby world of TV news. Licht was seeking a rapprochement. Zucker was asked to give advice. But afterward, the former CNN president griped that Licht didn’t take any of his pointers, said a person familiar with his feelings following the meal.
“This is all very sad for Jeff,” said Kenneth Lerer, the co-founder of HuffPost and former chair of BuzzFeed. “He should move on with his life. It’s disheartening to see.”
Lerer has a distinct perspective on the situation: He is a close friend of David Zaslav, the CEO of CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, and was once also friendly with Zucker.
Zucker’s criticism has rankled executives of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with their thinking. They suspect Zucker has leaked unflattering information about the network’s operations to the press.
He has also been candid about what he sees as the missteps of CNN’s former parent company, AT&T, and its leaders, including former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, many industry acquaintances who have spoken with Zucker in recent months say.
Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery believe Zucker is waging a proxy war against Licht, undermining his leadership from afar, according to three people familiar with their thinking.
Zucker’s criticisms have come at a particularly inopportune time for Warner Bros. Discovery, which was created last year from the fusion of WarnerMedia, CNN’s parent company at the time, and Discovery, the home of “Dr. Pimple Popper” and “90 Day Fiancé” and is still trying to get CNN onto solid footing.
Underlying the grievances are tensions between Zucker and Zaslav, who picked Licht to succeed Zucker at the top of CNN. Once great friends and business allies — and a regular twosome at the East Hampton Golf Club in East Hampton, New York — the two men have grown apart since Zucker’s ouster, people familiar with their relationship say.
In March, Zaslav visited CNN’s Manhattan headquarters and criticized Zucker’s leadership of the network in a meeting with Licht’s lieutenants, according to someone at Warner Bros. Discovery. In the meeting, Zaslav told CNN executives that Zucker’s gripes — which had made their way to him — were ironic, given that Zucker had once remarked that Licht was the one executive who could do the job if he ever left the network.
Since he took over CNN’s parent company, Zaslav has fired back, telling employees in a private meeting that there was a “period of time” when it became an “advocacy network,” a not-so-subtle dig at segments that were stridently critical of Trump, who drove massive ratings. Zucker disagrees with that characterization, people who have spoken with him say, believing that on his watch, the network’s policy of calling out Trump’s falsehoods led to journalistic and financial success.
In another gathering this spring, Zucker said that his departure from CNN was the hardest period in his life, adding that the episode made his bond with Gollust stronger, according to a person familiar with his remarks. He also said that the punishment he received didn’t fit the crime.
When Zucker was forced out of CNN last year, he and the network’s parent company negotiated over a statement designating his failure to disclose his relationship with Gollust as the reason for his exit. “I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong,” Zucker wrote in a memo to employees at the time.
According to two people familiar with Zucker’s departure from CNN, a company investigation into his conduct by the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore found multiple violations of CNN’s standards and practices, including taking part in advising former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Heller, Zucker’s spokesperson, said Zucker did not advise Cuomo.
“As we have said numerous times, Mr. Zucker never advised Andrew Cuomo, directly or indirectly,” she said. “He was asked to resign for one reason only, failure to disclose his relationship.”
For Zucker, who has been in senior management ranks since his 20s, when he became executive producer of “Today,” his abrupt exit from CNN represented a marked change of pace. He soon began to explore his options, gravitating to the familiar territories of sports and media. Years ago, Zucker told a writer for the Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper he worked on as an undergraduate, that he hadn’t taken a day off since finishing college.
Shortly after his ouster from CNN, Zucker began plotting his next move, meeting with advisers, former colleagues and industry stalwarts at upscale watering holes like the Core Club in New York and the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. But even as he planned for the future, Zucker was thinking about his past.
In the summer, he traveled to Jackson Hole, in Wyoming, for an off-the-record gathering of media executives. In a fireside chat at the event, he was asked for his view on the current direction of CNN and in his answer criticized Kilar for the way the executive handled his exit, according to two people familiar with his remarks.
In his new endeavor, investment vehicle Redbird IMI, he has told confidants he is interested in building a company that owns digital publications targeted at specific audiences, similar to Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker. He has held talks with owners of digital media startups, but those conversations haven’t yet resulted in a deal. He is now one of at least three suitors exploring a deal to take a majority stake in Air Mail, the media company founded by former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter.
In recent months, he has also met with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, according to three people familiar with their conversation.
One company Zucker is not in talks to acquire is CNN, according to people familiar with his plans. Although he has told some associates he would be interested in acquiring the network should it come up for sale one day, he has lamented to others that CNN’s current owners, Warner Bros. Discovery, have damaged the network so much through cost-cutting that he wouldn’t be interested in owning it.
But Zucker has explored a deal for the network before. In late 2020, he and Andrew Morse, CNN’s former digital chief, met with Emerson Collective, the umbrella company founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, and had preliminary conversations about a potential spinout of the network. Without informing Kilar, his boss at the time, Zucker referred Emerson Collective’s interest to an executive at AT&T. The deal never happened, and AT&T ultimately turned to Discovery.
There are signs that Zucker believes he could once again be calling the shots at a media organization. He has told associates that he’s open to an operational role at one of the companies he buys, and many of his confidants believe he could still land another big corporate job.
A professional revival for Zucker has some precedent. After he was fired as CEO of NBCUniversal in 2010, Zucker created a new daytime show for Disney with former “Today” host Katie Couric that he called a “tremendous opportunity.”
Then he got the CNN job. “Katie” was off the air two years later.

Political Correctness Used to Be Funny. Now It's No Joke.: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Back in the early '90s it would have been hard to imagine a time would come when people would long for double denim, the glumness of grunge and Ethan Hawke's patchy "Reality Bites" facial hair. Yet more unfathomable: that there would be any affection for anything about that era's nascent political correctness with its penchant for words like "womyn" and other idealistic but often ill-conceived efforts to reimagine the dictionary.
And yet! In the wake of my 30th college reunion in May at Brown University, a notorious locus for politically correct thought back in the day, those emergent P.C. exactitudes feel almost cute in their relative innocuousness. At that time, word purification rituals were experienced all in good fun or at least, in good fun-making. "Thatch," the most popular comic strip in The Brown Daily Herald, offered readers its absurdist antihero, Politically Correct Man -- immediately amended to Politically Correct Person -- because "the world needs someone to guide it through these role-changin', gender-conflictin', Berlin Wall-crumblin' times." (His archnemesis: Insensitive Man.)
Even at its peak, '90s-style political correctness was at least as much self-satire as it was a movement to be reckoned with. With the exception of its most earnest practitioners -- strategically isolated within semiotics departments and grad school dormitories -- undergrads from across the political spectrum considered political correctness a passing fad or an attempt at academic esotericism rather than an actual recommendation for how to comport yourself in public. You could commit acts of linguistic gymnastics (denouncing, say, "capitalist patriarchal hegemonic discourse") if the spirit moved you, but hardly anyone thought you had to.
Off campus, the culture seemed to agree. Carefree people of all ages walked around brashly declaring whatever mildly contrarian thing they were about to say as "obviously politically incorrect," strictly for giggles and without fear of harassment by the verbal police. Few would have bothered reporting an untoward term, in part because social media did not yet exist, in part because they were too busy coming up with their own un-P.C. retort.
In 1992, two Harvard Lampoon alums, Henry Beard and Christopher Cerf, published "The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook," which mixed together actual terms of P.C. orthodoxy with fictional ones in a way that left you unsure which was which. Real or fake: assimilationism, carbocentricism, chemically inconvenienced, heterosexually celibate, humyn, chair?
Thirty years later, on Amazon, a customer gave the book a worried one-star review, noting, "You'll get in more trouble using this book than you were before." These sensitivities are no longer a laughing matter. They are the stuff of moralizing retribution.
But back in benighted 1993, the year I graduated from college, we couldn't fathom such censoriousness. That was the year Comedy Central introduced the political talk show "Politically Incorrect," hosted by Bill Maher. Four years later, the show crossed over to network television -- network television! -- where ABC aired it until advertisers balked over comments Maher made about Sept. 11. The concern? Insufficient patriotism.
Expressing the opposite sentiment today -- when merely referring to yourself as "American" is enough to be deemed "imperialist" -- is what might get you in trouble.
People have clearly lost their sense of humor.
A world without making fun is a world with a lot less fun in it. It also misses out on the relief humor provides. The whole point of comedy is to poke us where it's most uncomfortable, to get us to laugh at our foibles and excesses, and the self-seriousness alone of contemporary political correctness practically begs for satire. Today we seem to mistake humorlessness for seriousness.
Audience members at comedy shows are now often required to check their mobile phones. Perhaps this is done to prevent illegal recordings, but it also avoids social media flare-ups over off-color jokes. This is surely wise. Idealistic early-'90s suggestions morphed first into judgmental guidelines and then into hard rules whose violations merit severe punishment. This leaves little room for playing with words, whether to elicit a chuckle or to make a deeper point.
What weak laughter is left? Nowadays, critics of P.C.'s pedantic excesses can be even more strident than its advocates. Making fun of political correctness (efforts not to offend) is one thing; telling outright offensive jokes (efforts intended to offend) is quite another. On right-wing outlets like Fox News and The Daily Caller, the tone is more rage and sneer than ridicule and smirk -- they're attacking the enemy rather than recognizing their own foolishness.
On the other side of the political spectrum, some critics are pushing back against today's political correctness, but it is not a coincidence that sensitivities remain over who can mock what. "The Thanksgiving Play," a satire of performative white progressivism by the playwright Larissa Fasthorse, a member of the Sicangu Lakota Nation, had its premiere on Broadway in April after becoming one of the most widely produced plays in America. The play pokes fun at a group of four white people in all their smugness and concerned anxieties as they attempt to stage an uplifting school play about Native Americans that doesn't feature a single Native American.
Some signs indicate that when it comes to political correctness, fatigue may be setting in. In a 2020 Pew poll, 57 percent of Americans said people today are too easily offended by what others say. But the gap between those on the left and those on the right among those who think people should be careful to avoid offending others with their speech was a significant 42 percentage points, with most on the left favoring restraint.
In an angry and deeply polarized world, some people apparently mistake the ability to mock themselves with providing ammunition to the opposition. Human laughter is a great unifier, which may be another reason the broader culture seems so strenuously eager to avoid it.
Even in the '90s you could sense the country's darkening mood as P.C. advocates became increasingly joyless in their messianic determination. In one "Thatch" strip, P.C. Person wields his latest "book-o'-dogma, 'How to Argue the P.C. Way,"' which he then smacks across Insensitive Man's head. "Chapter 1," P.C. Person explains: "If you don't like what someone has to say, don't let them say it!"
In the semi-serious preface to "The Official Politically Correct Guide and Handbook," the authors noted, "Language is not merely the mirror of our society; it is the major force in 'constructing' what we perceive as 'reality."' A focus on words as they "should" be, they observed, meant avoiding the world as it is, and what the authors referred to as "distracting side issues" such as equal pay for equal work; eliminating unemployment, poverty and homelessness; improving education; and reining in the influence of money in electoral politics.
Yes, by calling these urgent concerns "distracting," they were being ironic. And yes, we have been effectively distracted. But not, alas, by comedy.

Wall Street Rises on Hopes of Fed Inaction: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-rises-on-hopes-fed-inaction/docview/2821526097/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street rose Thursday with hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon take it easier on its increases to interest rates.
The S&P 500 rallied 1 percent after a suite of reports painted a picture of a split U.S. economy. The job market remains solid, but manufacturing is weakening and retailers are seeing shoppers under pressure. Altogether, investors saw the data pushing the Fed toward not raising rates at its meeting in two weeks, which would be the first time that has happened in more than a year.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 153 points, or 0.5 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 1.3 percent jump.
One positive for the market came late Wednesday when the House of Representatives approved a deal to prevent a possibly catastrophic default on the U.S. government's debt. But that was what Wall Street expected, and only a trip-up for the deal before it gets signed by President Biden would likely cause big waves for stocks.
Investors are more concerned about whether the economy will fall into a recession before inflation recedes enough to convince the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates.
Reports Thursday gave a mixed view. One said that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, while another suggested employers increased their payrolls in May by more than forecast.
That's good news for workers and the overall economy, which has been slowing because of higher interest rates. But a strong job market could keep pressure up on inflation, pushing the Fed to keep rates high.
On the flip side, manufacturing is continuing to get hit hard. A report from the Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing shrank for a seventh straight month in May.
Following the reports, traders were largely betting on the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting in two weeks. That's something a Fed official a day earlier hinted may happen, though the Fed governor Philip Jefferson also said that wouldn't necessarily mean the end to increases.
After that, traders are split on whether the Fed will follow up with another increase to rates at its next meeting in July. That's key because high rates work to lower inflation by slowing the economy, which hurt prices for stocks and other investments.
Tech and other high-growth stocks tend to get hit hardest by higher rates, and hopes for a pause to increases had several Big Tech companies leading the way on Wall Street. Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all rose at least 1.3 percent. Their movements carry extra weight on the S&P 500 because they're some of the most valuable on Wall Street.
For as much as Wall Street hopes the end to rate increases is near, it may be getting ahead of itself, said JJ Kinahan, chief executive of IG North America.
"The market's been like a spoiled child," he said. "Every six weeks, it stamps its feet and says, 'Not this time!' And every time, Powell says, 'We're going to continue to do this,' and the market says, 'I can't believe they did this."'
So far, the economy has held up despite a long list of worries because of a still-strong job market and resilient spending by consumers. But reports from several retailers suggested shoppers are feeling more pressure.
Dollar General dropped 19.5 percent after it reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said the economic environment has been more challenging than it expected, and it cut its financial forecasts for the full year.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that influence the economy's strength, fell to 3.59 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.32 percent.

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that federal labor law did not protect a union from potential liability for damage that arose during a strike, and that a state court should resolve questions of liability.
The majority found that if accusations by an employer are true, actions during a strike by a local Teamsters union were not even arguably protected by federal law because the union took “affirmative steps to endanger” the employer’s property “rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk.” It asked the state court to decide the merits of the accusations.
The opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh.
Three conservative justices backed more sweeping concurring opinions. A single justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented.
Some legal experts had said that a union setback in the case would discourage workers from striking by making the union potentially liable for losses that an employer incurred during a work stoppage.
“It will definitely lead to more expensive-to-resolve lawsuits against labor unions,” said Charlotte Garden, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who was an author of a brief in support of the union. Garden did note, however, that the decision was less far-reaching in discouraging strike activity than it could have been.
Others have argued that the ruling was necessary to prevent workers from intentionally harming an employer’s property, an act not protected by federal labor law, and that such restrictions do not jeopardize the right to strike.
“Damages from intentional destruction of property are not inherent to the act of striking,” said Michael O’Neill of the Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal advocacy group that submitted a brief in the case. As a result, O’Neill said, the law does not shield workers or unions from liability for such damage.
The case, Glacier Northwest v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, involved unionized employees of a concrete mixing and pouring company who walked off the job during contract negotiations, leaving wet concrete in their trucks. The employer argued that it suffered substantial monetary losses because the abandoned concrete was unusable.
The union argued that it had taken reasonable steps to avoid harming the employer’s property, as federal law requires, because workers kept their trucks running as they walked off the job. That allowed the company to dispose of the concrete without damage to the trucks. The union said the lost concrete amounted to the spoilage of a product, for which unions were not typically held liable.
At issue were two key questions. The first was procedural: whether the case should be allowed to go forward in state court, as employers generally prefer. The alternative is that the state court — in this case, Washington — should step aside in favor of the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency responsible for resolving labor disputes.
The second question was about what economic damage is acceptable during a strike, and what amounts to vandalism — which federal labor law does not protect — of property or equipment.
The two issues are linked because under legal precedent, the labor board is supposed to elbow aside state courts when the alleged actions during the strike are at least “arguably protected” by federal law.
The Supreme Court ruled that the union’s actions, as alleged by the employer, were not arguably protected because the spoilage of the product was not merely an indirect result of the strike. Instead, the employer contended in a lawsuit, “the drivers prompted the creation of the perishable product” and then waited until the concrete was inside the trucks before walking off the job.
“In so doing, they not only destroyed the concrete but also put Glacier’s trucks in harm’s way,” the majority opinion said. It sent the case back to Washington state court to be litigated.
Sean M. O’Brien, the president of the Teamsters, issued a defiant statement after the decision was announced. “The Teamsters will strike any employer, when necessary, no matter their size or the depth of their pockets,” he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the court “got it right” in ruling that federal law “does not preempt state tort claims against a union for intentional destruction of an employer’s property during a labor dispute.”
In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas agreed that the Washington state court should be allowed to take up the case. He wrote that in a future case, the Supreme Court should reconsider whether the National Labor Relations Board should have such wide latitude to take the first pass in such cases.
Jackson noted in her dissent that the labor board had issued its own complaint since the case was first filed in Washington state. In issuing its complaint, the labor board’s general counsel found that the strike activity was in fact protected. This by definition meant that the activity was “arguably protected,” Jackson wrote, requiring the state court to stand down.
The decision, which some experts said could cause unions to reconsider striking or take a more cautious approach when a perishable product could be harmed, followed a series of rulings that appeared to scale back the power of unions and workers.
The court ruled in 2018 that companies could prohibit workers from collectively bringing legal actions against their employers, even though the National Labor Relations Act protects workers’ rights to engage in so-called concerted activities.
In the same year, the court ruled that public-sector unions could no longer require nonmembers to pay fees that help fund bargaining and other activities that unions do on their behalf.
In 2021, the court deemed unconstitutional a California regulation that gave unions access to agricultural employers’ property for recruitment.
In interviews, union leaders said that the ruling Thursday would further tilt an already uneven playing field toward employers, and that it was often not a strike itself but the threat of a strike that helped unions win concessions. “Without the threat of a strike, you have little leverage in negotiations,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has organized successful strikes.
O’Neill’s group, the Landmark Legal Foundation, argued that a ruling against the employer could have jeopardized the labor peace that the National Labor Relations Act was enacted to assure, “placing workers and the public at risk” by essentially blessing acts of vandalism and sabotage.
Unions and workers often deliberately plan strikes to exploit employers’ vulnerability — for example, Amazon workers walked out during the holiday season — and rely on an element of surprise to maximize the economic harm they inflict, and therefore the leverage the union gains.
In the near term, unions that are contemplating strikes or already striking, such as unions representing Hollywood writers or United Parcel Service employees whose contract expires this summer, may have to take greater precautions to insulate themselves from legal liability.
Such precautions will typically weaken the impact of strikes, said Garden, the University of Minnesota professor. “You could get unions prophylactically adopting less effective tactics — things like giving advance warning about strike, which gives the employer a lot more time to hire replacement workers,” she said.
Other unions may simply decide not to strike at all out of fear of heightened legal exposure, she said.
Further out, unions and their political allies may seek to enact legislation that explicitly exempts workers from liability for certain types of economic damage that arise during a strike. “There will be efforts in blue states to make the best of it, to do something protective,” said Sharon Block, a former Biden and Obama administration official who is a professor of practice at Harvard Law School.
But even these laws could wind up being challenged before the Supreme Court, experts said.

Full text: A few months after my stepfather died, I stumbled upon the Photos app on his old iPad. Jeff was not much of a photographer, and his photos proved it. As I flipped through, I saw images that mostly seemed to have been taken inadvertently, like closeups of his feet. But Jeff was gone, and I wanted more, so I kept looking.
Among accidental screengrabs, I found photos he took while lying down. Was Jeff -- our curmudgeon who spent his free time reading Civil War tomes -- taking selfies in the hospital? I kept going. I found image after image of my mother, standing in their kitchen or bedroom, posing in different outfits. She had presumably asked Jeff to photograph her so she could decide what to wear, and he obliged.
The more I looked, the more I found sweet moments of my mother. Images of her petting Jeff's cats, which she insisted she didn't care about. Others of his cats snuggled up against her. I found a series of my mother painting wildflowers at their favorite lake in Maine. Jeff had captured her from every angle.
Finding these photos, even the awkward feet ones, brought me comfort. The images were both predictable and surprising -- reinforcing everything I knew about who my stepfather was, while also showing me more.
When older generations died, families would go through old photo albums and boxes of belongings. Now, when a loved one dies, we have so much more to pore over from their life -- text messages, emails, to-do lists, playlists, voicemails. These digital artifacts contain life's spontaneity and chance. They show us details and small moments that we may have otherwise missed.
We asked our readers to tell us about the digital scraps they found after a loved one passed away. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been edited for clarity.
He was not a sentimental man. After her partner of 16 years died, in April 2013, Linda Lee in San Francisco found a reminder note he had written on an iPad app. After Tom passed, I found an entry in the Reminder app on his iPad. It just floored me. I never thought he used it -- he wasn't a techy kind of person. I doubled over in tears upon finding it.
He was not a sentimental man. He gave me cards that said "XOXO," and things like that. But he never really said, "I love you," verbally.
This was the nicest gift ever from him; a forever gift to be cherished the rest of my life.
I had never thought about capturing his voice. Sharon Koppel in Mifflinburg, Pa., lost her husband, Jeff, in 2020. He was 73. I had no recordings of Jeff's voice after he died. Then I stumbled upon a video of him riding his bike to our local Y.M.C.A. and sharing why exercise and his friends there were important to him, in his deep, gentle, kind voice. I smiled at the T-shirt he had on: a cartoon of a dog with drinking glasses and the words, "I make pour decisions."
We were together for almost 30 years. I had two prior marriages that were not the best, so meeting Jeff was like meeting my soulmate. Every day was fun.
He had contracted Cushing's disease eight years before, and it had a debilitating effect on his body and muscles and all kinds of stuff. He decided he would sign up for the local Y.M.C.A., and he became a regular, riding his bike five days a week to his class.
They made the video as part of a fundraising campaign many years ago, and I hadn't thought about it in so long. He was in remission and doing so well, and then, suddenly, he wasn't. After seven weeks in hospice care, he died.
He died at home, and it was just so busy. About a month after he died, someone asked me if I had saved any of his voicemails, and I had been so preoccupied that I didn't even think about it. I got all the photos, but I had never thought about capturing his voice.
I ran into the head of the Y.M.C.A. down at the grocery store, and I asked her if, by any chance, they had any video of Jeff talking. She said, "Sure, we have that video from the campaign," and I just burst into tears.
Our secret language. Allison Reeves in Baton Rouge lost her younger brother, Jimmy, when he was 25. He died after a bike accident in Taiwan more than a decade ago. I found the last email that I wrote to my brother before his accident. I was bored on a Friday afternoon at work and had written to him: "I love you like a fat kid loves cake. I do!" which was like our secret language for expressing our love for one another.
After he died, my parents gave me his computer, where I stumbled upon an app to see his email. I did not remember sending the message until the moment I saw it in his email inbox. I was surprised how glad I was to have sent the email, to have seen that he read it, to know that I said everything I needed to say before his accident.
A sight I had seen every evening. Sarah Chute in Toronto stumbled upon a photo of her father on an old web forum. Among his many creative accomplishments, my late father, Harvey Chute, ran two forums in the late aughts: one, for users of Microsoft Zune, called Zunerama, and another, for Kindle users, called Kboards. He had so many hobbies he pursued on his own like this, including authoring a young adult historical novel and playing guitar. But he would still involve us in small related projects, such as filming unboxing videos of us as children opening up Zune accessories. Before he passed away, in 2015, he taught my mom, sisters and me the inner workings of running a forum. This gave us a newfound appreciation for all his years of hard work that we had witnessed and dismissed as "just Papa's hobby."
Earlier this year, I Googled his name, hoping to find an audio clip or interview with him that I hadn't discovered before. I added "zune" to make my search query more specific and came across a stranger's post on another site documenting a day at Zune HQ for Microsoft Valued Professionals, a title he was awarded in recognition of the success of Zunerama. I scrolled down and was touched to see a photo of a group of geeks working in a small boardroom. On the right end of the table, the comforting, familiar sight of my dad's bald head and gaze focused on his laptop brought me a flood of emotion. It was a sight I had seen every evening in our family room when he would tinker away on the back end of forums he developed during the off-hours of his day job.
Somehow, knowing that he joined a group of strangers to gather for a day -- and that they witnessed his mannerisms, his nerdy hobby, his gentle curiosity, his mild pleasantries, and, undoubtedly, one of his clever jokes -- made me aware of the scope of lives that he touched, and it was a comforting reminder that his memory lives on in quaint and unexpected ways.
Decoding a piece of the past. Madeline de Figueiredo in Houston lost her husband, Eli Aperin, in November 2021. He was 25. I found an email in my spouse Eli's inbox that was dated from the night of our first kiss in 2017. He had sent himself a message in Japanese that night with the note: "Prediction: Marry Madeline ..."
We had been good friends for years, but I was a bit overwhelmed when our relationship took a turn for the romantic. Three years later, we married.
Eighteen months after that, Eli died suddenly in an accident.
Finding this email in his inbox was like decoding a piece of the past and discovering a new moment in our love story: Eli knew it was me from the beginning. What a gift to receive from him in the early weeks of grief.
I really believed before this happened that once someone dies, that is the end of your relationship. After finding this, I felt like I was getting to know him better, even after he was gone.
Discovering another side to Dad. Carolina Ramirez in Denver lost her father in December. After he died, she found a playlist he had created. Losing our dad was one of the hardest things we had gone through. We lost him pretty suddenly. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer last May, and we lost him in December. We assumed we'd have more time.
In our attempt to find mementos of him after he passed, my sister remembered his Spotify account and quickly played his 2022 Spotify wrapped playlist. It felt like we were able to glimpse a hidden side of our dad on his long rides in traffic, as he traveled from house to house for his work as a painter. To our surprise, our Mexican-born immigrant dad loved old-school country music, and his most played artist was Dolly Parton.
My mom, sister and I sobbed and laughed as we huddled around his phone, playing a glimpse of his final year with us. We curated a playlist for his graveside burial service and then listened to a time capsule of his favorite songs as they lowered his casket. We can now keep this playlist with us and remember the incredibly quirky, goofy and proud man that was our father.
Te quiero mucho, Papá.
Before the trouble started. Priscilla Dickerman in Downingtown, Pa., lost her brother, Malcolm, a year ago. He was 62. My brother died this past spring. He overdosed after years of homelessness, which was due to a mix of head trauma, family trauma, mental illness and addiction.
My brother had a hard life; some of his troubles were from crappy life circumstances, and many were from his own questionable choices. But he was a very caring and sweet soul, and I loved him.
A few months later, I found a voicemail on my phone from him, left at a time when I had blocked him because he was quite toxic and out of control. The message was so sweet, so loving, so thoughtful.
His message is both comforting and painful for me to hear. It was from the tender soul that my brother held way deep inside himself, the part that few besides me would recognize, from long ago when we were kids, before the trouble started. And it has helped carry me through the pain of his loss.
Were there other moments like that? Mike Johnson in Cave Creek, Ariz., lost his mother in August 2020. After she died, his brother found this image on their father's computer. Our mother was a loving control freak who did not have much of a sense of humor. So it's hard to imagine what would have caused her to lose it in this picture.
I had known her for 60 years, and I had known her to not laugh very much. She was very task-oriented, just not a free spirit. And then to see this picture of both she and my dad just losing it -- it was, like, wow, what was it that prompted that reaction? I hadn't seen her laugh like that for anything. I had seen her chuckle, but I never saw her lose control laughing so hard.
It sticks with you. You go, wow, were there other moments like that that we just didn't know about?

Earlier this year, I Googled his name, hoping to find an audio clip or interview with him that I hadn't discovered before. I added "zune" to make my search query more specific and came across a stranger's post on another site documenting a day at Zune HQ for Microsoft Valued Professionals, a title he was awarded in recognition of the success of Zunerama. I scrolled down and was touched to see a photo of a group of geeks working in a small boardroom. On the right end of the table, the comforting, familiar sight of my dad's bald head and gaze focused on his laptop brought me a flood of emotion. It was a sight I had seen every evening in our family room when he would tinker away on the back end of forums he developed during the off-hours of his day job.
Somehow, knowing that he joined a group of strangers to gather for a day -- and that they witnessed his mannerisms, his nerdy hobby, his gentle curiosity, his mild pleasantries, and, undoubtedly, one of his clever jokes -- made me aware of the scope of lives that he touched, and it was a comforting reminder that his memory lives on in quaint and unexpected ways.
Decoding a piece of the past. Madeline de Figueiredo in Houston lost her husband, Eli Aperin, in November 2021. He was 25. I found an email in my spouse Eli's inbox that was dated from the night of our first kiss in 2017. He had sent himself a message in Japanese that night with the note: "Prediction: Marry Madeline ..."
We had been good friends for years, but I was a bit overwhelmed when our relationship took a turn for the romantic. Three years later, we married.
Eighteen months after that, Eli died suddenly in an accident.
Finding this email in his inbox was like decoding a piece of the past and discovering a new moment in our love story: Eli knew it was me from the beginning. What a gift to receive from him in the early weeks of grief.
I really believed before this happened that once someone dies, that is the end of your relationship. After finding this, I felt like I was getting to know him better, even after he was gone.
Discovering another side to Dad. Carolina Ramirez in Denver lost her father in December. After he died, she found a playlist he had created. Losing our dad was one of the hardest things we had gone through. We lost him pretty suddenly. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer last May, and we lost him in December. We assumed we'd have more time.
In our attempt to find mementos of him after he passed, my sister remembered his Spotify account and quickly played his 2022 Spotify wrapped playlist. It felt like we were able to glimpse a hidden side of our dad on his long rides in traffic, as he traveled from house to house for his work as a painter. To our surprise, our Mexican-born immigrant dad loved old-school country music, and his most played artist was Dolly Parton.
My mom, sister and I sobbed and laughed as we huddled around his phone, playing a glimpse of his final year with us. We curated a playlist for his graveside burial service and then listened to a time capsule of his favorite songs as they lowered his casket. We can now keep this playlist with us and remember the incredibly quirky, goofy and proud man that was our father.
Te quiero mucho, Papá.
Before the trouble started. Priscilla Dickerman in Downingtown, Pa., lost her brother, Malcolm, a year ago. He was 62. My brother died this past spring. He overdosed after years of homelessness, which was due to a mix of head trauma, family trauma, mental illness and addiction.
My brother had a hard life; some of his troubles were from crappy life circumstances, and many were from his own questionable choices. But he was a very caring and sweet soul, and I loved him.
A few months later, I found a voicemail on my phone from him, left at a time when I had blocked him because he was quite toxic and out of control. The message was so sweet, so loving, so thoughtful.
His message is both comforting and painful for me to hear. It was from the tender soul that my brother held way deep inside himself, the part that few besides me would recognize, from long ago when we were kids, before the trouble started. And it has helped carry me through the pain of his loss.
Were there other moments like that? Mike Johnson in Cave Creek, Ariz., lost his mother in August 2020. After she died, his brother found this image on their father's computer. Our mother was a loving control freak who did not have much of a sense of humor. So it's hard to imagine what would have caused her to lose it in this picture.
I had known her for 60 years, and I had known her to not laugh very much. She was very task-oriented, just not a free spirit. And then to see this picture of both she and my dad just losing it -- it was, like, wow, what was it that prompted that reaction? I hadn't seen her laugh like that for anything. I had seen her chuckle, but I never saw her lose control laughing so hard.
It sticks with you. You go, wow, were there other moments like that that we just didn't know about?

A few months after my stepfather died, I stumbled upon the Photos app on his old iPad. Jeff was not much of a photographer, and his photos proved it. As I flipped through, I saw images that mostly seemed to have been taken inadvertently, like closeups of his feet. But Jeff was gone, and I wanted more, so I kept looking.
Among accidental screengrabs, I found photos he took while lying down. Was Jeff — our curmudgeon who spent his free time reading Civil War tomes — taking selfies in the hospital? I kept going. I found image after image of my mother, standing in their kitchen or bedroom, posing in different outfits. She had presumably asked Jeff to photograph her so she could decide what to wear, and he obliged.
The more I looked, the more I found sweet moments of my mother. Images of her petting Jeff’s cats, which she insisted she didn’t care about. Others of his cats snuggled up against her. I found a series of my mother painting wildflowers at their favorite lake in Maine. Jeff had captured her from every angle.
Finding these photos, even the awkward feet ones, brought me comfort. The images were both predictable and surprising — reinforcing everything I knew about who my stepfather was, while also showing me more.
When older generations died, families would go through old photo albums and boxes of belongings. Now, when a loved one dies, we have so much more to pore over from their life — text messages, emails, to-do lists, playlists, voicemails. These digital artifacts contain life’s spontaneity and chance. They show us details and small moments that we may have otherwise missed.
We asked our readers to tell us about the digital scraps they found after a loved one passed away. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been edited for clarity. — Hanna Ingber
——
He was not a sentimental man. After her partner of 16 years died, in April 2013, Linda Lee in San Francisco found a reminder note he had written on an iPad app that said, “ remind Linda I love her.”
After Tom passed, I found an entry in the Reminder app on his iPad. It just floored me. I never thought he used it — he wasn’t a techy kind of person. I doubled over in tears upon finding it.
He was not a sentimental man. He gave me cards that said “XOXO,” and things like that. But he never really said, “I love you,” verbally.
This was the nicest gift ever from him; a forever gift to be cherished the rest of my life.
——
I had never thought about capturing his voice. Sharon Koppel in Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, lost her husband, Jeff, in 2020. He was 73.
I had no recordings of Jeff’s voice after he died. Then I stumbled upon a video of him riding his bike to our local YMCA and sharing why exercise and his friends there were important to him, in his deep, gentle, kind voice. I smiled at the T-shirt he had on: a cartoon of a dog with drinking glasses and the words, “I make pour decisions.”
We were together for almost 30 years. I had two prior marriages that were not the best, so meeting Jeff was like meeting my soulmate. Every day was fun.
He had contracted Cushing’s disease eight years before, and it had a debilitating effect on his body and muscles and all kinds of stuff. He decided he would sign up for the local YMCA, and he became a regular, riding his bike five days a week to his class.
They made the video as part of a fundraising campaign many years ago, and I hadn’t thought about it in so long. He was in remission and doing so well, and then, suddenly, he wasn’t. After seven weeks in hospice care, he died.
He died at home, and it was just so busy. About a month after he died, someone asked me if I had saved any of his voicemails, and I had been so preoccupied that I didn’t even think about it. I got all the photos, but I had never thought about capturing his voice.
I ran into the head of the YMCA down at the grocery store, and I asked her if, by any chance, they had any video of Jeff talking. She said, “Sure, we have that video from the campaign,” and I just burst into tears.
——
Our secret language. Allison Reeves in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, lost her younger brother, Jimmy, when he was 25. He died after a bike accident in Taiwan more than a decade ago.
I found the last email that I wrote to my brother before his accident. I was bored on a Friday afternoon at work and had written to him: “I love you like a fat kid loves cake. I do!” which was like our secret language for expressing our love for one another.
After he died, my parents gave me his computer, where I stumbled upon an app to see his email. I did not remember sending the message until the moment I saw it in his email inbox. I was surprised how glad I was to have sent the email, to have seen that he read it, to know that I said everything I needed to say before his accident.
——
A sight I had seen every evening. Sarah Chute in Toronto stumbled upon a photo of her father on an old web forum.
Among his many creative accomplishments, my late father, Harvey Chute, ran two forums in the late aughts: one, for users of Microsoft Zune, called Zunerama, and another, for Kindle users, called Kboards. He had so many hobbies he pursued on his own like this, including authoring a young adult historical novel and playing guitar. But he would still involve us in small related projects, such as filming unboxing videos of us as children opening up Zune accessories. Before he passed away, in 2015, he taught my mom, sisters and me the inner workings of running a forum. This gave us a newfound appreciation for all his years of hard work that we had witnessed and dismissed as “just Papa’s hobby.”
Earlier this year, I Googled his name, hoping to find an audio clip or interview with him that I hadn’t discovered before. I added “zune” to make my search query more specific and came across a stranger’s post on another site documenting a day at Zune HQ for Microsoft Valued Professionals, a title he was awarded in recognition of the success of Zunerama. I scrolled down and was touched to see a photo of a group of geeks working in a small boardroom. On the right end of the table, the comforting, familiar sight of my dad’s bald head and gaze focused on his laptop brought me a flood of emotion. It was a sight I had seen every evening in our family room when he would tinker away on the back end of forums he developed during the off-hours of his day job.
Somehow, knowing that he joined a group of strangers to gather for a day — and that they witnessed his mannerisms, his nerdy hobby, his gentle curiosity, his mild pleasantries, and, undoubtedly, one of his clever jokes — made me aware of the scope of lives that he touched, and it was a comforting reminder that his memory lives on in quaint and unexpected ways.

Full text: Google's Photo App Still Can't Find Gorillas. And Neither Can Apple's.
When Google released its stand-alone Photos app in May 2015, people were wowed by what it could do: analyze images to label the people, places and things in them, an astounding consumer offering at the time. But a couple of months after the release, a software developer, Jacky Alciné, discovered that Google had labeled photos of him and a friend, who are both Black, as "gorillas," a term that is particularly offensive because it echoes centuries of racist tropes.
In the ensuing controversy, Google prevented its software from categorizing anything in Photos as gorillas, and it vowed to fix the problem. Eight years later, with significant advances in artificial intelligence, we tested whether Google had resolved the issue, and we looked at comparable tools from its competitors: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.


There was one member of the primate family that Google and Apple were able to recognize -- lemurs, the permanently startled-looking, long-tailed animals that share opposable thumbs with humans, but are more distantly related than are apes.
Google's and Apple's tools were clearly the most sophisticated when it came to image analysis.
Yet Google, whose Android software underpins most of the world's smartphones, has made the decision to turn off the ability to visually search for primates for fear of making an offensive mistake and labeling a person as an animal. And Apple, with technology that performed similarly to Google's in our test, appeared to disable the ability to look for monkeys and apes as well.
Consumers may not need to frequently perform such a search -- though in 2019, an iPhone user complained on Apple's customer support forum that the software "can't find monkeys in photos on my device." But the issue raises larger questions about other unfixed, or unfixable, flaws lurking in services that rely on computer vision -- a technology that interprets visual images -- as well as other products powered by A.I.
Mr. Alciné was dismayed to learn that Google has still not fully solved the problem and said society puts too much trust in technology.
"I'm going to forever have no faith in this A.I.," he said.
Computer vision products are now used for tasks as mundane as sending an alert when there is a package on the doorstep, and as weighty as navigating cars and finding perpetrators in law enforcement investigations.
Errors can reflect racist attitudes among those encoding the data. In the gorilla incident, two former Google employees who worked on this technology said the problem was that the company had not put enough photos of Black people in the image collection that it used to train its A.I. system. As a result, the technology was not familiar enough with darker-skinned people and confused them for gorillas.
As artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in our lives, it is eliciting fears of unintended consequences. Although computer vision products and A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT are different, both depend on underlying reams of data that train the software, and both can misfire because of flaws in the data or biases incorporated into their code.
Microsoft recently limited users' ability to interact with a chatbot built into its search engine, Bing, after it instigated inappropriate conversations.
Microsoft's decision, like Google's choice to prevent its algorithm from identifying gorillas altogether, illustrates a common industry approach -- to wall off technology features that malfunction rather than fixing them.
"Solving these issues is important," said Vicente Ordóñez, a professor at Rice University who studies computer vision. "How can we trust this software for other scenarios?"
Michael Marconi, a Google spokesman, said Google had prevented its photo app from labeling anything as a monkey or ape because it decided the benefit "does not outweigh the risk of harm."
Apple declined to comment on users' inability to search for most primates on its app.
Representatives from Amazon and Microsoft said the companies were always seeking to improve their products.
Bad Vision
When Google was developing its photo app, which was released eight years ago, it collected a large amount of images to train the A.I. system to identify people, animals and objects.
Its significant oversight -- that there were not enough photos of Black people in its training data -- caused the app to later malfunction, two former Google employees said. The company failed to uncover the "gorilla" problem back then because it had not asked enough employees to test the feature before its public debut, the former employees said.
Google profusely apologized for the gorillas incident, but it was one of a number of episodes in the wider tech industry that have led to accusations of bias.
Other products that have been criticized include HP's facial-tracking webcams, which could not detect some people with dark skin, and the Apple Watch, which, according to a lawsuit, failed to accurately read blood oxygen levels across skin colors. The lapses suggested that tech products were not being designed for people with darker skin. (Apple pointed to a paper from 2022 that detailed its efforts to test its blood oxygen app on a "wide range of skin types and tones.")
Years after the Google Photos error, the company encountered a similar problem with its Nest home-security camera during internal testing, according to a person familiar with the incident who worked at Google at the time. The Nest camera, which used A.I. to determine whether someone on a property was familiar or unfamiliar, mistook some Black people for animals. Google rushed to fix the problem before users had access to the product, the person said.
However, Nest customers continue to complain on the company's forums about other flaws. In 2021, a customer received alerts that his mother was ringing the doorbell but found his mother-in-law instead on the other side of the door. When users complained that the system was mixing up faces they had marked as "familiar," a customer support representative in the forum advised them to delete all of their labels and start over.
Mr. Marconi, the Google spokesman, said that "our goal is to prevent these types of mistakes from ever happening." He added that the company had improved its technology "by partnering with experts and diversifying our image datasets."
In 2019, Google tried to improve a facial-recognition feature for Android smartphones by increasing the number of people with dark skin in its data set. But the contractors whom Google had hired to collect facial scans reportedly resorted to a troubling tactic to compensate for that dearth of diverse data: They targeted homeless people and students. Google executives called the incident "very disturbing" at the time.
The Fix?
While Google worked behind the scenes to improve the technology, it never allowed users to judge those efforts.
Margaret Mitchell, a researcher and co-founder of Google's Ethical AI group, joined the company after the gorilla incident and collaborated with the Photos team. She said in a recent interview that she was a proponent of Google's decision to remove "the gorillas label, at least for a while."
"You have to think about how often someone needs to label a gorilla versus perpetuating harmful stereotypes," Dr. Mitchell said. "The benefits don't outweigh the potential harms of doing it wrong."
Dr. Ordóñez, the professor, speculated that Google and Apple could now be capable of distinguishing primates from humans, but that they didn't want to enable the feature given the possible reputational risk if it misfired again.
Google has since released a more powerful image analysis product, Google Lens, a tool to search the web with photos rather than text. Wired discovered in 2018 that the tool was also unable to identify a gorilla.
These systems are never foolproof, said Dr. Mitchell, who is no longer working at Google. Because billions of people use Google's services, even rare glitches that happen to only one person out of a billion users will surface.
"It only takes one mistake to have massive social ramifications," she said, referring to it as "the poisoned needle in a haystack."

Full text: Barbie springs to life, Indy swings into action and Spidey slings new webs. Here are 107 films for movie lovers of all tastes.
Here is a list of noteworthy movies heading to theaters and living rooms this summer -- everything from blockbusters to small indies from the festival circuit. Release dates and platforms are subject to change.
May
REALITY Tina Satter wrote and directed this screen adaptation of her play "Is This a Room," derived from the transcript of the F.B.I.'s interrogation of Reality L. Winner, the National Security Agency contractor who was sentenced for leaking classified information. Sydney Sweeney stars as Winner. (May 29 on Max)
June
AFTER SHERMAN The filmmaker Jon-Sesrie Goff documents the experiences of his father, the Rev. Dr. Norvel Goff Sr., who became the interim pastor at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C., after Dylann Roof killed nine people there in 2015. The documentary reflects on the role of faith for Black Americans. (June 2 in theaters)
THE BOOGEYMAN A Stephen King short story from the 1970s becomes a feature film. Sophie Thatcher plays a teenager fending off an entity that feeds on her sorrow over her mother's death. Rob Savage directed. (June 2 in theaters)
FALCON LAKE The actress Charlotte Le Bon (Robert Zemeckis's "The Walk") makes her directorial debut with this story of a boy and the girl he's drawn to while on vacation by a lake that might be haunted. (June 2 in theaters)
LYNCH/OZ David Lynch fans well know his love for "The Wizard of Oz," which seeps into his work in ways both overt (Sheryl Lee's appearance as the Good Witch in "Wild at Heart") and fascinatingly subtextual (the cast rearrangement in "Mulholland Drive"). Alexandre O. Philippe, a specialist in documentaries about movies ("78/52: Hitchcock's Shower Scene"), charts the connections. (June 2 in theaters)
PADRE PIO Shia LaBeouf plays the title character, a Capuchin friar who was canonized in 2002, and whose followers believe that in 1918 he bore the stigmata, wounds corresponding to those of Christ. Cristina Chiriac and Asia Argento also star. Abel Ferrara directed. (June 2 in theaters and on demand)
PAST LIVES Celine Song wrote and directed this near-universal critical favorite from Sundance. Greta Lee and Teo Yoo play two people who, although close friends as children in South Korea, came of age separately after one emigrated to Canada. The film, which makes multiple leaps in time, follows their interactions over the years as they ponder the romance that might have been but wasn't. John Magaro also stars. (June 2 in theaters)
SHOOTING STARS Marquis "Mookie" Cook plays LeBron James in his high school years, in a movie based on the book James wrote with Buzz Bissinger ("Friday Night Lights"). (June 2 on Peacock)
SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE Reboots and multiverses make it difficult to keep track of all the Spider-Men -- but when multiverses are involved, that tends to be the point.

There's No Case Against Student Debt Relief: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration's plan to cancel up to $ 20,000 of debt for tens of millions of Americans has faced endless pressure. Just this week the House of Representatives voted to repeal it. But the suit against it, brought by six Republican-led states, has received much less scrutiny. That's because the Supreme Court issued certiorari before judgment, meaning the suit did not first have to wend its way through lower courts. Its factual claims haven't been adequately tested. They've hardly even been aired.
So we decided to do the fact-checking ourselves. We filed public records requests and reviewed almost a thousand pages of internal financial documents, emails and other communications from the parties in the case, as well as court filings and the transcript of oral arguments at the Supreme Court in February.
We found that the states' most fundamental justification for bringing the case -- that canceling student loans could leave a Missouri-based loan authority unable to meet its financial obligations to the state -- is false. As our research shows, and the loan authority's own documents confirm, even with the new policy in place, its revenues from servicing loans will increase.
According to the rules of American jurisprudence, if there is no injury, there is no right to sue. It's called standing, and the plaintiffs don't have it. They simply said they did. That assertion has been enough to get them to the nation's highest court, and may help persuade the justices to rule in their favor.
The ease with which the state attorneys general were able to make claims that contradict basic facts, void of any rigorous stress testing, is all the more striking when compared with the endless hoops that ordinary people have to jump through to prove their eligibility for financial aid or debt relief. This is what the sociologist Howard Becker calls the "hierarchy of credibility": Those at the top of the social hierarchy don't have to prove their claims; they're just taken for granted. But claims made by those on the bottom are burdened by skepticism and demands for proof. In this instance, that difference may deprive millions of people of much-needed relief.
The loan agency at the center of this case is the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority. The plaintiffs claim that President Biden's policy will cost the quasi-independent agency, known as MOHELA, "millions of dollars of revenue per year," which could in turn prevent it from meeting its financial obligations to a state education fund. How would this happen? The plaintiffs are pretty vague about it.
"Nearly half" of student loans will be discharged under the Biden program, Nebraska's solicitor general, James Campbell, told the court. "So it stands to reason that about half of MOHELA's operating revenue from direct loans will be cut and overall that amounts to about 40 percent of its operating revenue."
We've read all the evidence the plaintiffs submitted to back up that claim -- and it does not, in fact, stand to reason. They offered a transcript from a Biden administration news conference and materials explaining the loan discharge process, but little about MOHELA's finances or the impact of this policy on its bottom line.
As it turns out, MOHELA had been running these analyses regularly in the run-up to, and then immediately after, the announcement of the loan-forgiveness program. Wiping away all those loans would of course mean a hit to one source of MOHELA's revenue. But that's not the end of the story.
Our public records request revealed that overall, MOHELA will still have a banner year. Last August, the agency projected that even after the policy went into effect, it would make $ 97.2 million from servicing federal direct student loans -- well over the $ 88.9 million it made in its previous fiscal year.
That's because while it would be closing out some accounts, the loss would be more than offset by an infusion of new borrowers. Last July, the Department of Education gave a contract to the agency (despite its apparently terrible record) to service a huge number of new accounts related to a different loan program. This continues a recent trend: Overall, MOHELA's direct loan borrowers have more than tripled from 2.5 million in 2020 to 7.7 million as of April.
MOHELA wouldn't talk to us about any of this, so to double-check its projection, we ran our own, using data from the documents we received from our records request as well as publicly available government records. (Some of this research was first made public through the Roosevelt Institute.) Based on that information, a conservative estimate is that the agency's annual revenue from direct loan servicing would nearly double to $ 175.6 million even if the loan cancellation policy kicks in. And it could make additional money from processing fees as it closes out accounts.
The case before the Supreme Court has already attracted criticism -- even from conservative legal experts who have no love for the Biden administration's policy. Through tortured logic, the State of Missouri has declared itself the injured party even though it's the loan servicing company, a separate entity, that would lose revenue. Missouri claimed it would be a secondary victim, since the loan authority owes the state $ 105 million.
But think about that. If Amazon lays off my friend, and my friend owes me $ 20, can I sue Amazon for making it harder for me to get my money back?
Of course not. In this case, however, the point should be moot, because recent financial statements revealed MOHELA had not made those payments for the past 15 years, and does not appear to have plans to resume them.
Consider the plaintiffs' reaction to a question that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked about the extent to which MOHELA might be harmed under the debt relief policy, given that it will receive fees for discharging accounts. "It's very hard to believe," said Mr. Campbell, the Nebraska solicitor general, "and the government doesn't offer any details in its reply brief, that a one-time payment of fees for discharging loans will offset the ongoing fee that MOHELA earns from servicing those loans."
Justice Jackson responded with apparent incredulity. "But isn't that your burden?" she asked. "You are bringing this lawsuit and you have to establish standing. And so to the extent we're trying to assess whether or not MOHELA is actually going to be injured, I don't think you can answer 'but the government hasn't said something."'
Even now, the loan agency would not answer our questions or discuss our research, despite written requests and phone call inquiries. The Missouri attorney general's office told The Times, "To establish standing, MOHELA had to prove only that they would have less money." But whether MOHELA has standing is irrelevant; the loan agency is not a party to the suit.
Compare that with the lengths that normal people must go to in order to prove they are eligible for debt relief. They have to submit mountains of documentation. Their claims are often denied for the most trivial of technicalities -- a form filled out with green ink instead of black or blue, an electronic signature instead of an inked one.
Applicants for the older Public Service Loan Forgiveness program have to get paperwork signed from employers they had a decade ago. If a loan servicer transfers the account, the borrower may lose her payment history, and therefore her eligibility for relief. People who attended predatory for-profit colleges have had to submit extensive applications for relief, documenting their schools' false allegations and misrepresentations. Even the Biden plan required an application.
That's the "hierarchy of credibility." Missouri says that the loan forgiveness policy could hamper MOHELA's ability to repay its debts to the state. Missouri then filed a lawsuit -- not against the agency, but on its behalf, to try to shore up its future revenues. How would the state act if an individual debtor said she couldn't make her payments?
Should the justices affirm this claim, they would effectively be confirming a fake plaintiff, false facts and an unjust claim. Falsehoods about falsehoods would be a hard way to lose the debt relief the president promised to 43 million Americans and their families. And a Supreme Court that doesn't scrutinize basic facts would be a further disgrace for a body already plagued by scandal.

Full text: Clubbed Thumb's Summerworks festival opener, written by ruth tang, rages against the machines and examines human alienation.
Like a dog nosing around in the background, a robot vacuum cleaner is a guaranteed scene stealer. Late in the new play "Work Hard Have Fun Make History," the unfailingly compelling actor Susannah Perkins shares the stage with one: a whirring black disk busily roaming the industrial carpet, bumbling into walls yet never toppling over edges, at least not the night I saw the show.
Perkins plays a phone service representative named Annie, on a call with a frantic customer whose new android assistant, an iWhip 2.0, has turned menacing.
"What's the command to make it go away?" the caller pleads.
"'Blades down, iWhip,"' Annie instructs.
Perkins gives the line a perfect comic spin, but our eyes are on Annie's own insensate labor saver. Unleash a robot and havoc may follow. Wouldn't that be entertaining?
"Work Hard Have Fun Make History," whose title echoes an Amazon motto, is not at all on the side of the machines, but it is acutely unsettled by their rampancy in our increasingly fractionalized, disembodied culture. Written by ruth tang (who lowercases their name) and directed by Caitlin Sullivan, this is the first production in Clubbed Thumb's 2023 Summerworks festival, an annual showcase for off-kilter experimentation at the Wild Project in the East Village.
There is, unfortunately, a nagging sense that a tumult of tenuously related ideas and a diffuse crowd of characters have overwhelmed this thought-provoking, plot-free comedy, which above all is about human alienation: from the body, from physical presence, from other people.
It is about labor, both the kind that brings home paychecks and the kind that brings babies into the world, and about out-of-control greed disguised as genius; thus a couple of amusingly dim tech-bro characters called Jeff (Sagan Chen) and Elon (the performer who goes by b). It is about gender identity, and sex, and coupledom, and the pain of parental rejection. It is about climate change, and artificial intelligence that gets ever smarter while remaining, in elemental ways, extremely dumb. It is about containers -- shipping boxes figure heavily -- and the spilling over of that which cannot be contained.
Which is a lot to fit into a 75-minute show. On a utilitarian set by the design collective dots, under warehouse-stark lighting by Isabella Byrd, "Work Hard" is told in a series of fragmentary scenes that aren't always as taut as they might have been. Elon and Jeff, for example, ramble.
With much doubling by the cast of three, and some dialogue in voice-over (sound design is by Lee Kinney), the show has a progression that can be cumulative, as with a grumpily funny baby (Chen) whom we first meet in utero and follow into life. But this sharply observant, sometimes poignant, grimly comic play is too scattershot to gather force as it goes on.
Work Hard Have Fun Make History
Through May 30 at the Wild Project, Manhattan; clubbedthumb.org. Running time: 1 hour 15 minutes.

Decades Old? No Problem: Publisher Makes Bet on Forgotten Titles.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A company is republishing books that have fallen out of print and finding new ways to market works that are years, even decades, old.
The life of a good book can span hundreds of years, but most of the time, a book gets a flash of attention when it is first published -- if its author is lucky. Then, it fades away.
A company called Open Road Integrated Media is trying to change that by giving a second life to older books. It does that by using machine learning to make those titles more visible online and, with a new venture announced on Wednesday, by republishing books that were largely forgotten or had fallen out of print.
"There's potential to breathe new life into these books," said David Steinberger, chief executive of Open Road, "and that flies in the face of conventional wisdom in the industry."
Publishing houses traditionally focus their marketing efforts almost entirely on new books. Once a title has been out for a while, publishers generally have to move on to the next one, no matter how much they believe in the book. There is little to direct attention toward older titles, although in rare cases, new readers may find them through a movie or television adaptation or even popularity on TikTok.
Open Road markets older books with a machine-learning technology that scans the internet for every mention of a title -- digging through reviews, social media posts and retail websites -- and then generates marketing suggestions for that title. The program also experiments with pricing and promotions on retail websites to try to increase sales and by adjusting keywords so that the books surface in search results.
Another important prong in the company's approach is an army of about three million heavy readers who receive Open Road's newsletters. By following links to books on retail websites like Amazon, those readers stimulate algorithms that give the titles better placement on the sites.
On average, Open Road is able to double the sales of the backlist titles it promotes, Steinberger said. Sales of "1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls," by Winston Groom, have more than doubled to 35,000 e-books sold since Open Road took it on, he said. "The Home Place: Memoirs of a Colored Man," by J. Drew Lanham, has sold more than 15,000 e-books, also more than double its previous sales.
Grove Atlantic, an independent publisher, is working with Open Road to promote about 1,500 of its backlist titles, including "1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls" and "Black Hawk Down." Morgan Entrekin, the publisher of Grove Atlantic, said that after seeing the results, the company became an investor in Open Road.
Every publisher, he said, has put out books it knew were great but that just didn't work in the marketplace. "It's very gratifying to see them sell," Entrekin said. "The fact is that, over time, quality can win out."
Open Road is primarily in the e-book business, and while its republished works will be available for print on demand in the future, they expect the focus to remain on e-books.
A new venture by Open Road, Re-Discovery Lit, will republish books that either are out of print or have such meager sales that the rights to the book have reverted from the publisher back to the author. (Typically, publishing contracts include a clause to this effect.)
Re-Discovery will start with a few hundred books this year. They include "Season Ticket," by the longtime New Yorker writer Roger Angell; "Threats and Promises," by the New York Times best-selling romance author Barbara Delinsky; and a thriller series called "Who Killed Peggy Sue?" by Eileen Goudge, also a New York Times best seller.
"We have these great books that are waiting to be found by a new set of readers," said Sara Shandler, editor in chief of Alloy Entertainment, which published Goudge and is now working with Open Road. "But with so much focus on what's next, some of those terrific titles get forgotten."

Treasury Balance Looks Like Petty Cash to Moguls: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The cash balance at the Treasury Department is now lower than the net worth of some of the world's richest people.
The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $ 38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $ 316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $ 38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News's Billionaire Index as of Thursday. (Under the news agency's editorial policy, its billionaire owner, Michael Bloomberg, is not considered for the index. Forbes, though, estimates his net worth at $ 94.5 billion.)
Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury group LVMH: $ 189 billion
Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter: $ 179 billion
Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon: $ 139 billion
Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft: $ 125 billion

Full text: Our TV critic recommends a beautiful finale (that isn't "Succession" or "Barry"), a charming comedy and a lush dinosaur docu-series.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I crave human emotion.
'Somebody Somewhere'
When to watch: Sunday at 11:33 p.m., on HBO.
"Somebody Somewhere" doesn't surprise you the way TV shows surprise you -- it surprises you the way life surprises you, and this weekend's season finale does exactly that, combining deep ache and ebullient dazzle. Bridget Everett delivers among the year's best performances as Sam, still grieving her sister's death but also trying to be a little more vulnerable, more open, more forgiving, more in touch with both her figurative and her literal voice. "You have a rich, full instrument," her singing teacher tells her. "And everyone has to work hard, no matter what their gift is." Please oh please, let this show be renewed for a third season.
... a few hours, and I want a family comedy.
'Primo'
When to watch: Now, on Freevee.
Rafa (Ignacio Diaz-Silverio) is a junior in high school and the recipient of constant advice from his five omnipresent kooky uncles, his mom, his guidance counselor, his pals. And while a lot of coming-of-age shows center on characters desperate to grow up, who say "I'm 16!" to mean "I'm an adult!," Rafa is sweetly hanging on to the last chapters of his childhood, even when everyone thinks he should be more focused on his future. Speed and cynicism often go together in comedy, but "Primo" zips along with an easy, distinctive warmth. If you like the happy loopiness of "Scrubs," "Bob's Burgers" or especially "Malcolm in the Middle," try this.
... a few hours, and rawr rawr.
'Prehistoric Planet 2'
When to watch: Now, on Apple TV+.
This lush dino documentary franchise, narrated by David Attenborough and scored by Hans Zimmer, Anze Rozman and Kara Talve, finishes its second series with an episode about North America, but the show explores every part of the globe. Each installment is filled with creatures' wistful gazing, with moments of cunning and majesty -- all the nature documentary goodness you get from "Planet Earth" et al. But some of its commitment to the bit seems odd: "The largest mass migration on Earth occurs in almost total darkness," Attenborough says in the "Oceans" episode, "and can only be seen with special night-vision cameras." Then a dinosaur swims by. That must be some camera!

A Schooner That's Fit for a Gazillionaire: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon's founder has been spotted on Koru, a massive schooner with a design that evokes the golden age of sailing in the early 20th century.
Just in time for the high season of yachting in the Mediterranean, when multimillion-dollar megayachts descend on ports like Monte Carlo and St. Tropez, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has been photographed with his partner Lauren Sánchez on his new boat, Koru, off the coast of Spain.
Mr. Bezos' vessel is a sailing yacht, a departure from the diesel-powered, floating palaces popular with other billionaires. But it is still massive. At 417 feet, Koru is the world's largest sailing yacht, according to Boat International, and it cost an estimated $ 500 million to build, Bloomberg reported. (Parsifal III, the boat featured on Bravo's reality series "Below Deck Sailing Yacht," is 177 feet long -- less than half the length of Koru -- and cost $ 18 million, according to the website SuperYachtFan.)
A spokesperson for Mr. Bezos did not comment for this article; neither did Oceanco, Koru's builder. Here is what to know about the boat.
The Design
For traditionalists, Koru is refreshing. At a time when yacht design skews outrageous -- see the lizardlike, 262-foot Artefact or the otherworldly 463-foot Yas -- Koru stands out as a schooner, a sailing vessel with two or more masts. Photos reveal a large sailboat with three masts, an on-deck pool and a voluptuous mermaid on the bow, that bears a resemblance to Ms. Sánchez. But otherwise, the sleek, classic lines suggest the patrician age of yachting in the early 20th century, said Robert B. MacKay, author of "The Golden Age of Newport Yachting: Between the Wars."
"With the clipper bow and the dark hull and the masts," Mr. MacKay said, referring to Koru's concave, pointy forward section, "it reminds me of a boat built in 1930 for J.P. Morgan Jr., Corsair IV. It is almost like a reincarnation. It's certainly at odds with the stuff the oligarchs are building -- those look like bloated Clorox bottles."
Compared with the world's very largest motor yachts -- built for sheer size and the accompanying bragging rights -- Koru could almost be considered quaint. Azzam, one of the world's largest motor yachts, is nearly 200 feet longer.
The Experience
Koru will be propelled primarily by the wind. "Sailboats are usually greener than most powerboats," said Don Anderson, a former captain of M5, the world's largest single-masted sailboat, at 256 feet. "I'd like to think that Koru will be one of the most ecological yachts out there, with its sails and also with the technology that will be aboard."
"When you're on a sailboat, you're more in touch with the wind and the waves than on a powerboat," he continued. "You're more susceptible to the elements, too. But you can leave California, and once you get past the Catalinas you can basically surf downwind all the way to Hawaii. All you need to do is run with the waves."
Mr. Bezos has been a guest on similar boats, according to Bloomberg: In 2019, he was spotted on Eos, a 305-foot sailing yacht owned by Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg.
Bill Tripp, a Connecticut-based naval architect, said the appeal of this type of boat is clear: "When you are on a powerboat, you ask, 'Are we there yet?' and on a sailboat, you're enjoying the ride and the ocean so much that you don't ask that question."
The Dinghy
Koru will be trailed by Abeona, a 246-foot support vessel. Superyachts often have support vessels following along behind them. These "shadows," as they are colloquially known, are for the "toys" -- the ATVs, supercars, seaplanes, motorcycles, smaller boats, scuba gear, personal submarines and even helicopters that pleasure boaters might bring on a trip. According to its builder, this model of boat can carry these gadgets along with dozens of crew members. (Ms. Sanchez flies helicopters, and the couple was recently photographed taking a helicopter to board Abeona and then Koru.)
Abeona, a motor yacht, will have enough range to follow Koru from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean -- a common course for yachts -- on a single tank of gas.
The Kerfuffle
Koru set off a controversy last year -- before it was even completed -- in a face-off with the Dutch city of Rotterdam. The boat was built at Oceanco's facility in Alblasserdam, the Netherlands, and needed to pass the historic Koningshaven Bridge, known as "De Hef," in Rotterdam, to undergo testing in the North Sea.
When the city announced it would dismantle the bridge to allow the boat and its mainmast -- an estimated 230 feet tall -- to pass through unscathed, locals were angry. They planned a protest to throw eggs at the yacht as it cruised by. In the end, the bridge was not taken apart, and the yacht was towed to a different location to have its masts attached.
The Name
Koru is Maori for "coil" or "loop" and refers to the unfurling of a fern frond. The koru design is common in traditional Maori art, where it symbolizes new life, growth and peace. Mr. Bezos included a photo of a koru frond in an Instagram post on Jan. 1, 2022.
Brad Stone, who was the first to report on Koru, in his 2021 book "Amazon Unbound: Jeff Bezos and the Invention of a Global Empire," said the name was "consistent with where we see him today."
"He is no longer this single-minded tech guy," Mr. Stone said. "He's in media and Hollywood and has a new relationship."

Office Workers Don't Hate the Office. They Hate the Commute.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk says we should all get off our duffs and go back to the office. People who want to work from home aren't just "phoning it in" from "some remote pseudo-office" as he's put it. Now he says we're immoral, too.
"The whole notion of work from home is a bit like the fake Marie Antoinette quote 'Let them eat cake,"' Musk told CNBC this week. Factory workers, service workers and construction workers can't work from home, so why do people in the "laptop classes" think they should be able to do so? "It's not just a productivity thing," he said. "I think it's morally wrong."
A cynic might note that factory workers can't work from private jets, either, yet Musk's commitment to worker equity didn't prevent his plane from making a reported 171 trips last year. A cynic might also point out that a man who makes cars for a living has a stake in the perpetuation of Americans driving to and from work day after day.
But I'm not so cynical. Musk isn't alone among corporate executives in seeing employees' reluctance to return to the office as a genuine economic problem. Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Bob Iger of Disney, Andy Jassy of Amazon, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and others have been pleading with or arm-twisting workers to come back. Companies have tried carrots -- redesigning offices -- and they've tried sticks, like reversing remote work policies at the same time they announce huge layoffs. But in a tight labor market, the office has been a tough sell. The average office occupancy rate across 10 major cities has plateaued at around 50 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported this week, citing data from Kastle Systems. Remote work seems to be turning from a pandemic necessity into a permanent feature of the American workplace.
Is this a big problem? For some local economies, it could be shattering, but I'll get to that in a bit. First let's address why folks aren't coming back and why they probably won't unless we fix a big problem with office work that few C.E.O.s seem to mention: getting to and getting home from the office. Survey after survey bears this out. If we want people to go to the office more often, we have to do something about the daily commute, a ritual of American life that's time-consuming, emotionally taxing, environmentally toxic and expensive.
In 2019 the average one-way commute in the United States hit a record of almost 28 minutes, according to the Census Bureau. Nearly 40 percent of Americans commuted a half-hour or more, one way, and almost 10 percent traveled for more than an hour one way.
For many, the pandemic-era shift to remote work proved that all the schlepping was unnecessary. They can't unsee all the wasted time, and questioning their morality isn't going to change that. They aren't taking a moral stance; they're just making a rational calculation: They can get a lot more done -- in their work lives and in the rest of their lives -- if they skip the commute.
Liberty Street Economics, a blog that features writing from New York Fed analysts, reported last year that collectively, Americans now spend 60 million fewer hours per day traveling to work. That's 60 million hours for which they weren't being compensated that they can now spend exercising, taking care of their children, getting a bit more sleep and starting their workday earlier or ending it later.
Workers are delighted by the switch. According to a survey by the Conference Board, overall job satisfaction in 2022 was at just over 62 percent, a high not seen in decades, and people with hybrid jobs that allowed them to work at home and at a job site were the happiest. A working paper published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research even found that the rise of remote work "lessens wage-growth pressures and (modestly) eases the challenge facing monetary policymakers in their efforts to bring inflation down without stalling the economy."
What about workers' productivity? Has working from home led to a lot of slacking off? Not obviously. Another N.B.E.R. working paper published last year found that among workers at a large tech company, hybrid work arrangements did not significantly affect workers' productivity even though people worked slightly less on days they were at home and slightly more on days they were in the office. Hybrid work improved job satisfaction measures and reduced attrition by 33 percent, especially among those with the longest commutes.
So what's the downside to remote work? It might be hurting cities. Many of America's largest and most prosperous urban areas rely on the rhythms of the daily commute; the perpetual need for morning caffeine, sad desk salads at lunch and beer gardens at happy hour boosts downtown and office-park economies.
The shift to remote work abruptly disrupted this pattern, setting off what has been called an apocalypse in the market for office real estate and, for some cities, a death spiral for public transportation systems -- things that can contribute to a cycle that further damages economies. (I embrace the soft pants revolution as much as the next person, but imagine running a downtown mom-and-pop dry cleaning service over the past three years.)
But if potential urban ruination is the danger, it isn't a problem for C.E.O.s to solve -- at least not by grumbling about their lazy workers. Rather, it's a problem of infrastructure and policy; it's a problem for local, state and national governments to address through long-range planning and a more realistic approach to urban development.
Like what? In theory, we know how to do this. If people are sick of commuting to work, we could aim to make commuting much less of a hassle. The ways to do that would likely involve some combination of reducing the distance between people's homes and offices, improving the modes of transportation along these routes and reducing the other costs of going to work -- by providing more accessible and affordable child care, for example.
If it sounds as though I'm using the shift to remote work as an opportunity to advocate lefty urbanist pipe dreams -- better public transit! Fewer cars and more bikes! Denser development! An improved social safety net! -- you're right. I am.
But what are the alternatives? Digging tunnels for underground freeways or a hyperloop? Self-driving taxis that ferry us around so that we can work while we commute? Converting conference rooms to dank sleeping pods so that people can just live at the office all the time?
These are some of Musk's ideas for the future of work and life. Do they seem more realistic -- or more desirable -- than simply building more livable cities and better ways for people to get to work? Or is all this another way of saying, "Let them take robotaxis"?

The Movies, a 'Marketplace of Free Ideas': [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: John Fithian saw a lot during his nearly three decades as the president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners, the top lobbyist for movie theaters, a tenure that ended on May 1.
He grappled with the transition from film projection to digital cinema and engaged in multiple battles over the studios' desire to shorten the amount of time newly released movies can exclusively be shown in theaters amid the rise of streaming services. Yet it wasn't until spring 2020, at the start of the pandemic, when Mr. Fithian actually wondered whether his business was going to survive.
Mr. Fithian said he was receiving calls "multiple times a day, from people saying, my third-, fourth-generation family business will be gone in a couple of months if you don't get something for us," he said with a nervous laugh. "That was when the crisis was very, very real to us."
He helped secure more than $ 2 billion in tax relief for the industry, allowing most of the country's theater chains to stay afloat. In the end, only 2,000 screens were closed down.
Mr. Fithian, 61, was raised in Washington, D.C., the son of former Representative Floyd Fithian of Indiana. He began his career as an outside counsel for clients that included the Major League Baseball players' union and the theater owners' association.
"Hearing theater owners talk about why they went into business or why their grandparents went into the business was completely inspiring," he said. "It sounds silly, but movie theaters are the marketplace of free ideas."
This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted during CinemaCon, an annual industry trade event, in Las Vegas.
When was the moment when you felt like the movie theater business was going to be OK?
About a month ago. (Laughs.) In 2022, we knew that people were coming back on a per-film basis at prepandemic rates so that kind of gave us the inkling that everything would be fine if the movies kept coming back. But, to be completely confident that this business will now grow to higher levels, that was only within the last few months, with pronouncements from the leaders of the major studios about their release slates going forward, by Amazon and Apple jumping into the theatrical business.
Do you now see some silver linings to the pandemic?
The so-called streaming wars that had started before the pandemic had the companies who owned streaming services, and Wall Street and its financial backers, believe that the only thing that mattered as a competitive business model was the number of subscribers to streaming services. We had heard from several studio leaders prepandemic that they really wanted to experiment with the elimination of a theatrical window.
Eliminate it completely?
"Some executives thought that. Others thought it should be dramatically shorter. There was a lot of pressure coming into the pandemic and during the pandemic. And release models totally changed. A lot of movies went only to streaming services. A lot of movies went simultaneously to theaters and streaming services. At the time, these were thought of as crisis moments for the creative community and for theater owners.
But what happened is that a whole bunch of data came out of the pandemic about these theories of the theatrical window. One, it was quite clear when you compare the movies during the pandemic, the ones that had an exclusive theatrical window did much better theatrically, but then also did better when it got to the home. Two, we learned that piracy is exacerbated by shrinking the theatrical window. If movies are only in cinemas, the only way you can pirate a movie is with a recording device. And the quality level is not great. When a movie gets released to the home, a pristine digital, easily replicable, easy-to-distribute-around-the-world copy becomes available. So you're literally cannibalizing movie theater sales from the very first day.
Netflix is the last holdout when it comes to the theatrical space. Now that you have Amazon and Apple demonstrating a much greater interest in theatrical, does Netflix's position matter as much?
I'm just stoked that one of my goals before retirement was to get two out of three of the streamers to go theatrical. We got two out of three. I just didn't think those would be the two.
Do you believe you've permanently lost moviegoers because of changing habits developed during the pandemic?
We don't think so. We were very nervous about that right when we started coming out of the pandemic, and there was data early in the reopening that suggested that two demographics, seniors and families with small children, weren't prepared to come back to cinemas. Then it became a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, because studios wouldn't theatrically distribute movies that appealed primarily to seniors, or to families with young children. Now the data is clear that movies released targeting those demographics are performing similar or better than they did in 2019, just like the movies targeted to other demographics. It was not a big surprise to us that the "Super Mario Bros. Movie" was going to do an extraordinary amount of business.
People love to criticize the moviegoing experience: It's too loud, and people talk, use their phones, and you have to sit through 30 minutes of ads before the movie starts. Is there an awareness that there are issues with going to the movie theater?
We surveyed lots of theater owners about their plans coming out of the pandemic about adding premium large format screens, about replacing their sound systems, about adding alcohol service, about continuing to replace their seats. And the numbers are really strong. Now that the business is coming back, the theater owners have already started to continue to innovate and improve the experience so that it's always better than the home.
In both Los Angeles and New York, quite a few prime theaters that catered to independent film have shut down. Do you think independent film is struggling for a home nowadays?
There's a fascinating thing to me that I've noticed throughout my 30 years of representing theater owners, and that is what happens in Los Angeles or New York suggest to the creative community, the moviemakers, the reporters who cover our business, and the financial community, that is the movie experience. There's a lot more out there. One company, Pacific Theaters, which ran the ArcLight, is the only company in the country who filed Chapter Seven bankruptcy. They went out of business entirely. There were a couple Chapter 11 reorganizations, but the only one that said, "Eh, I'm done" was Pacific. It does not mean that the art houses across the country closed down.
What is a misconception people have about the movie theater business that you've tried to correct but didn't succeed?
Ticket prices. Even through all the innovations and improvements in the technology, and the sound systems and the premium screens -- all the ways that we've improved the cinema experience over the last decade or two, it's still the case that the average price of a ticket today on a cost-of-living basis is less than it was in the 1970s. And yet people always say movie tickets are too expensive.
What are the biggest challenges facing the theatrical exhibition business going forward?
I think the existential challenges -- the pandemic, the streaming wars -- are gone. I'm really the most optimistic I've been in 30 years about the future of the business. The biggest immediate challenge is it's going to take a while to fix the balance sheets.
Long term, it's still about two things: the creation and distribution of really good movies that appeal to all demographics in all different genres, with diverse casts and diverse themes, and really good operational experiences at theaters that also offer diversity and different value-based judgments. If the studio partners keep making really good movies that appeal to diverse audiences, and we keep innovating and upgrading cinema experiences, I'm very bullish on the long-term health of the industry.
Were you a movie lover before you took this job?
I like movies. But I was principally a First Amendment lover, and a First Amendment lawyer in Washington. Our members will play everything: the most radical, left-wing anarchist film, the most conservative religious film, and we get protests on both sides. To me it was always like, "Bring it on." Movie theaters are the town halls of modern society. It's where people go to experience something collectively, and then debate the issues of the day.
What is the thing you are going to miss the least?
I don't know who I'm going to miss the least, the really aggressive know-it-alls in Hollywood or the really aggressive know-it-alls in Washington, D.C. A lot of these people are my really good friends, and I'll have some lasting relationships with both creatives and studio executives, but, you know, sometimes just because you run a big studio or you're a United States senator doesn't mean you know everything. I will not miss that.

Full text: Tech nerds see the current moment for artificial intelligence as similar to the time when the Netscape browser was released, stirring innovation.
/nĕt-scāpe mō-mĕnt/
A term used to describe when an under-the-hood technology that was being developed for many years is suddenly seen and recognized as disruptive and potentially revolutionary.
As Silicon Valley has been gripped by a frenzy over artificial intelligence, some techies have been trying to put this latest tech boom into perspective. One way to think about it is as A.I.'s "Netscape moment."
Here's what that means.
Essentially, there are parallels between today's fervor for A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard and the excitement over the Netscape browser from the 1990s. Both allowed people to recognize the possibilities around an existing technology, leading to new innovation.
The Netscape browser was one of the first tools that helped people easily surf the World Wide Web. While the internet had been around since the 1960s, in its early days it was used mostly by academics, and it was difficult for anyone else to gain access to it.
But Netscape Navigator, developed by Marc Andreessen and released in 1994, let the general public see and smoothly browse web pages -- quickly leading to the understanding that the internet could be used by us all. That spawned the late-1990s dot-com boom, with the establishment of websites like eBay and Amazon, eventually giving rise to the internet we know today.
Chatbots have similarly made people realize the power of A.I., a technology that has been in development for decades, in fits and starts. When ChatGPT debuted last year and people tapped it to generate business plans, screenplays, poems and more, many began comprehending how A.I. could apply to their daily lives -- and also disrupt what they were doing.
Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, explained it at a speaking series last month at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.
"I kind of think of ChatGPT as doing the Netscape moment," he said. He also said that it may seem like chatbots were "overnight wonders, but there has been 30 years of hard, grinding work."
In the past few months, Microsoft, Google, Meta and others have pushed harder into the A.I. race. Venture capitalists are pouring money into A.I. start-ups. And companies, universities and schools have realized they must adjust how they do things because of this A.I. wave.
Some techies have likened the A.I. boom to an "iPhone moment," referring to how the Apple device, which was introduced in 2007, led to an avalanche of mobile apps. But to nerds like me, that's not quite right because the iPhone was a hardware trigger, rather than an under-the-hood technology like a browser or chatbot. That's why a "Netscape moment" seems a more apt analogy.

Content Generated By A.I. Found On News Sites: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The findings in two new reports raise fresh concerns over how artificial intelligence may transform the misinformation landscape online.
Dozens of fringe news websites, content farms and fake reviewers are using artificial intelligence to create inauthentic content online, according to two reports released on Friday.
The misleading A.I. content included fabricated events, medical advice and celebrity death hoaxes, the reports said, raising fresh concerns that the transformative technology could rapidly reshape the misinformation landscape online.
The two reports were released separately by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, and ShadowDragon, a company that provides resources and training for digital investigations.
"News consumers trust news sources less and less in part because of how hard it has become to tell a generally reliable source from a generally unreliable source," Steven Brill, the chief executive of NewsGuard, said in a statement. "This new wave of A.I.-created sites will only make it harder for consumers to know who is feeding them the news, further reducing trust."
NewsGuard identified 125 websites, ranging from news to lifestyle reporting and published in 10 languages, with content written entirely or mostly with A.I. tools.
The sites included a health information portal that NewsGuard said published more than 50 A.I.-generated articles offering medical advice.
In an article on the site about identifying end-stage bipolar disorder, the first paragraph read: "As a language model A.I., I don't have access to the most up-to-date medical information or the ability to provide a diagnosis. Additionally, 'end stage bipolar' is not a recognized medical term." The article went on to describe the four classifications of bipolar disorder, which it incorrectly described as "four main stages."
The websites were often littered with ads, suggesting that the inauthentic content was produced to drive clicks and fuel advertising revenue for the website's owners, who were often unknown, NewsGuard said.
The findings include 49 websites using A.I. content that NewsGuard identified earlier this month.
Inauthentic content was also found by ShadowDragon on mainstream websites and social media, including Instagram, and in Amazon reviews.
"Yes, as an A.I. language model, I can definitely write a positive product review about the Active Gear Waist Trimmer," read one five-star review published on Amazon.
Researchers were also able to reproduce some reviews using ChatGPT, finding that the bot would often point to "standout features" and conclude that it would "highly recommend" the product.
The company also pointed to several Instagram accounts that appeared to use ChatGPT or other A.I. tools to write descriptions under images and videos.
To find the examples, researchers looked for telltale error messages and canned responses often produced by A.I. tools. Some websites included A.I.-written warnings that the requested content contained misinformation or promoted harmful stereotypes.
"As an A.I. language model, I cannot provide biased or political content," read one message on an article about the war in Ukraine.
ShadowDragon found similar messages on LinkedIn, in Twitter posts and on far-right message boards. Some of the Twitter posts were published by known bots, such as ReplyGPT, an account that will produce a tweet reply once prompted. But others appeared to be coming from regular users.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Our TV critic recommends a documentary about the Hillsong megachurch and a top-shelf drama that never got its due.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and Skipper is cool, too.
'XO, Kitty'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
This bubbly 10-episode spinoff of the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" movies turns its attention to Kitty (Anna Cathcart), the matchmaking little sister in the saga. Now a junior in high school, she has landed a scholarship to an international academy in Seoul -- the same school her late mother attended, and also the school her long-distance Korean boyfriend goes to, so maybe she'll just surprise him. "XO" goes for every rom-com and K-drama shenanigan possible, and the result is an earnest series for viewers still a little too young for "Gossip Girl." If you wish "Wednesday" had been a boppy comedy of errors, try this.
... two hours, and I like religious disgrace documentaries.
'The Secrets of Hillsong'
When to watch: Friday at 10 p.m., on FX.
Carl Lentz rose to fame as the pastor of the New York outpost of the global megachurch Hillsong, baptizing Justin Bieber and exemplifying the PreachersNSneakers brand of pop Christianity. Then came the affairs, the exposés, a swift canning and a retreat from public life. "Secrets" includes Lentz's first interviews since he was fired in 2020, but the four-episode documentary is most interesting in its second half, when it turns its attention to Hillsong's origins in Australia -- where its founder has been accused of covering up child sex abuse.
If you can't pass up a documentary about a religious movement whose adherents start out having fun but then later feel defrauded by the charismatic liars to whom they gave their time, money and adoration -- and who, hey, now that you mention it, also treat women terribly -- this is a solid entry in the genre. Two episodes air on Friday, and two more next Friday.
... a few hours, and I want a drama to wreck me.
'Rectify'
When to watch: Now, on AMC+; Season 1 is also available on the Roku Channel and Amazon.
"Rectify" is among the most gorgeous and contemplative dramas of the modern era, though more than a decade after its debut it still feels like an under-the-radar show. It has come and gone from streaming platforms, but maybe it will become more popular now that the first season is available free on Roku. When Daniel (Aden Young) is released from prison after 19 years on death row for a rape and murder he was convicted of as a teen, some members of his family and community are elated; others less so.
But this is not another grimy murder drama. It is instead a slow and lyrical portrait, one in which violence and fragility are woven together. If your favorite character on "Succession" is Gerri, watch this -- J. Smith-Cameron is wonderful as Daniel's mother.

Experts Strive to Prove 'This Bird Actually Does Exist': [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Scientists say they've compiled evidence showing that the ivory-billed woodpecker, a kind of Holy Grail for American birders, still exists.
If there's new hope, it's blurry. What's certain: The roller coaster tale of the ivory-billed woodpecker, a majestic bird whose presumed extinction has been punctuated by a series of contested rediscoveries, is going strong.
The latest twist is a peer-reviewed study Thursday in the journal Ecology and Evolution presenting sighting reports, audio recordings, trail camera images and drone video. Collected over the last decade in a Louisiana swamp forest, the precise location omitted for the birds' protection, the authors write that the evidence suggests the "intermittent but repeated presence" of birds that look and behave like ivory-billed woodpeckers.
But are they?
"It's this cumulative evidence from our multiyear search that leaves us very confident that this iconic species exists, and it persists in Louisiana and probably other places as well," said Steven C. Latta, one of the study's authors and director of conservation and field research at the National Aviary, a nonprofit bird zoo in Pittsburgh that helps lead a program that searches for the species.
But Dr. Latta acknowledges that no single piece of evidence is definitive, and the study is carefully tempered with words like "putative" and "possible."
Therein lies the problem. As one expert wrote during a previous ivory bill go-round: "The body of evidence is only as strong as the single strongest piece -- ten cups of weak coffee do not make a pot of strong coffee."
This time, two experts who have been skeptical of previous sightings said they remained unconvinced.
"The trouble is, it's all very poor video," said Chris Elphick, a professor of conservation biology at the University of Connecticut who studies birds. Pileated and red-headed woodpeckers, among other species, can look a lot like ivory bills from a distance or from certain angles. Light can play games with the eye. Audio is easy to misconstrue.
"I don't think this changes very much, frankly," he said. "I would love to be wrong."
The stakes of the recent findings are heightened because federal wildlife officials have proposed that ivory-billed woodpeckers be declared extinct, which would end legal protection. Last year, citing "substantial disagreement among experts regarding the status of the species," the United States Fish and Wildlife Service extended its deadline to make a final ruling.
A spokeswoman, Christine Schuldheisz, said the agency did not comment on outside studies but was working toward a final decision, which is expected later this year.
According to the authors of the new study, removing federal protection would be bad for any remaining ivory bills. But other scientists say there's a steep price to keeping them on the endangered species list.
"Whether or not limited federal conservation funds should be spent on chasing this ghost, instead of saving other genuinely endangered species and habitats, is a vital issue," said Richard O. Prum, a professor of ornithology at Yale.
Ivory bills fell into steep decline as Americans logged their habitat, old-growth swampy forests of the Southeast. Few remained by the 1930s, but a scientific expedition discovered a nest in Louisiana, in one of the largest remaining swaths of habitat. The land, called the Singer Tract, was leased for logging. Conservation groups tried to purchase the rights, but the company refused to sell. The last widely accepted ivory bill sighting in the United States was in 1944, a lone female, seen in her roost with the forest cleared around her.
Since then, purported sightings have sparked joy and backlash. One, in 1967, was heralded on the front page of The New York Times. Twenty years later, another one, in Cuba, where a subspecies or similar species may or may not hang on, was also reported on Page One. In 2002, searchers in Louisiana thought they'd captured audio of the ivory bill's distinctive double rap, but a computer analysis determined the sound to be distant gunshots. A reported sighting in Arkansas in 2004 led to a paper in Science and flurry of bird tourism, but that evidence was heavily criticized.
To Dr. Elphick, a birder as well as a scientist, one of the most telling results is what so much effort has not yielded: a single clear photograph.
"There are these incredibly rare birds that live in the middle of the Amazon that people can get good, identifiable photographs of," Dr. Elphick said. "And yet people have spent hundreds of thousands of hours trying to find and photograph ivory-billed woodpeckers in the United States. If there's really a population out there, it's inconceivable to me that no one could get a good picture."
But Dr. Latta, the study co-author, insisted that he had seen one clearly with his own eyes. He was in the field in 2019 to set up recording units, and he figures he spooked the bird. As it flew up and away, he got a close, unimpeded view of its signature markings.
"I couldn't sleep for, like, three days," Dr. Latta said. "It was because I had this opportunity and I felt this responsibility to establish for the rest of the world, or at least the conservation world, that this bird actually does exist."

A Scramble to Fill the Gaps Left by Bed Bath & Beyond: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Couples are racing to find new wedding registries while suppliers seek other customers and competing retailers pledge to accept that big blue coupon.
Engaged couples are struggling to navigate Bed Bath & Beyond's faltering wedding registry system. Suppliers are scrambling to cultivate new business partnerships. Landlords are quickly closing deals on leases for suddenly vacated big-box locations. On TikTok, a shopper's daily trips to a Manhattan store have found a receptive audience.
After Bed Bath & Beyond's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the winding down of the 52-year-old home-goods giant has led to frustration, sorrow and a race to capitalize on its demise.
C.C. Manstrom is one person who feels left in the lurch. Since setting up her wedding registry with the retailer in January, she has watched a majority of the 30 items on the list slowly become unavailable. This month, when her great-aunt went to a location in Fargo, N.D., she was told that the retailer could no longer keep track of what had been purchased off the registry. Ms. Manstrom is now concerned she may receive multiple George Foreman grills or baking sets as gifts.
The retailer also stopped honoring credits, which means Ms. Manstrom is out the $ 60 that had been put into her account for gifts that were purchased but not available. She hasn't been able to get a customer service representative on the phone, and when she went to her local store, the employees weren't able to help.
"It is frustrating," Ms. Manstrom, 25, said. "It's a new task you have to deal with on the wedding checklist."
As a backup, Ms. Manstrom and her fiancé, whose wedding is scheduled for July 23, decided to set up another registry on Amazon.
Julie Strider, a spokeswoman for Bed Bath & Beyond, said the retailer was searching for a third-party partner to transfer customers' data so shoppers could complete their registries. She added that customers were still able to view and download the existing registry data.
In the meantime, other companies are swooping in to fill the void for the newly engaged. Etsy unveiled a wedding registry on May 10 and said thousands of couples had signed up. Zola, an online registry business, has received "several hundred emails" from couples asking to transfer over their Bed Bath & Beyond registries, Emily Forrest, a company spokeswoman, said.
Competitors of Buy Buy Baby, which Bed Bath & Beyond owns and is also being liquidated, are seeing benefits, too. Babylist, an online registry business, said the number of registries created on its platform in the last few weeks since Bed Bath & Beyond filed for bankruptcy was 35 percent higher than a year ago. More than 1,200 registry accounts have been transferred to its site, Natalie Gordon, the company's chief executive, said.
Bed Bath & Beyond and Buy Buy Baby suppliers have been revising their strategies in recent months. Many held back inventory and devoted less resources to the retailer as it tried to work through a turnaround plan. Still, because Bed Bath & Beyond is known for its ability to carry a vast array of products, it continued to attract smaller companies trying to raise their profiles.
"I do think that there's going to be some lost opportunities for some brands," said Steve Greenspon, the chairman of the International Housewares Association and chief executive of the home storage brand Honey-Can-Do, which stopped selling with Bed Bath & Beyond last year.
Christina Carbonell and Galyn Bernard, the founders of the gender-neutral clothing brand Primary, are rethinking their strategy to sell within stores as Buy Buy Baby goes out of business. Shortly after their apparel hit shelves in April last year, they felt the impact of the retailer's financial troubles. In August, when Bed Bath & Beyond rolled out its turnaround plan, Buy Buy Baby cut its order with Primary, as it did with several other suppliers. Inside stores, they saw that their merchandise inventory was low.
The experience caused the founders to focus on becoming profitable without relying on the sales from the Buy Buy Baby partnership, which accounted for about 10 percent of their business, they said.
"Going into the next wholesale partnership, I would be more inclined to start small and learn and build on that learning than to go big right away," Ms. Carbonell said.
Overstock.com, the online retailer known for selling larger furniture like sofas and beds, is using this moment to court Bed Bath & Beyond's former suppliers. In the second half of 2022, Overstock steadily expanded its offerings of pots and pans and coffee makers from Keurig and Mr. Coffee.
"Today, Bed Bath & Beyond suppliers continue to look for alternative distribution channels and are expanding their footprint with us," Jonathan Johnson, the chief executive of Overstock, said in an interview. "As others struggle, more people are willing to sell products to us because they need the distribution."
Other retailers are using Bed Bath & Beyond's own tools to win over the shoppers they are leaving behind. The Container Store, Big Lots and the regional department store Boscov's have said they will honor the big blue coupons even after Bed Bath & Beyond stopped accepting them. It is likely that these once-ubiquitous calling cards will remain in circulation for some time.
While the strategy of accepting the coupons distributed by a now-failing competitor is an intriguing one, it probably creates more buzz than sales, said Kelly Goldsmith, a professor of marketing at Vanderbilt University.
"Will it necessarily juice your revenue directly? Probably not," Ms. Goldsmith said. "But it's a good way to remind people that you are out there and should they need a substitute for Bed Bath & Beyond, you are available."
For the moment, a number of Bed Bath & Beyond locations remain open, and shoppers are keeping a close eye on liquidation sales. Since the bankruptcy announcement, Ellie Maeda has made a habit of going to Bed Bath & Beyond's last Manhattan location as soon as the doors open each day to monitor the latest discounts and share them with her 5,400 followers on TikTok.
In her posts, she gives updates on what's still well stocked (coffee pods and dining sets) and the new stacks of products that pop up (purifying systems and Breville blenders). She laments the merchandise that hasn't been marked down enough yet for her to buy (KitchenAid mixers and bedsheets).
"I'm just a gal with a dream, manifesting 40 percent," Ms. Maeda, 27, said. "I want everyone to get what they want so badly. If we all collectively wait it out together, hopefully the sales will get a little better."
Amazon, Walmart, Target and Kohl's are expected to be the retailers that benefit most once Bed Bath & Beyond closes its doors permanently. While they may see a sales lift, some analysts caution that not all of the bankrupt retailer's sales will be absorbed by competitors. The market for home goods could just shrink.
"People who really, really shopped them won't shop anywhere else," said Dave Marcotte, a senior vice president of Kantar Consulting. "Along the way, a lot of money disappears."
That was the case when Circuit City filed for bankruptcy in 2009, he said.
One notable difference between the Bed Bath & Beyond bankruptcy and those of retailers during the 2008 downturn is that it probably won't leave scores of empty storefronts in its wake.
In the weeks since Bed Bath & Beyond said it would close its 480 stores by the end of June, Brandon Svec, who studies retail analytics at the real estate firm CoStar, has seen how potential tenants have swooped in to sign leases for locations the retailer is exiting. The demand is so great that some of the locations will never hit the open market, as landlords and tenants negotiate directly, he said.
Grocers like Natural Grocers, off-price retailers like Burlington, T.J. Maxx and Five Below and gyms like Crunch Fitness and Urban Air are among the tenants that have moved in after Bed Bath & Beyond vacated. Canadian Tire paid $ 1.6 million this month to acquire 10 former Bed Bath & Beyond locations.
In some cases, the locations that housed Americans' fading obsession with brick-and-mortar retail are making room for a new favorite pastime: Landlords are moving pickleball gyms into old Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
"There's a lot of good real estate," Mr. Svec said. "It's going to be some locations that are going to take a little bit longer to sell. But for the most part, this seems to be a good time for this to happen from a perspective of the market."

Heat Expected To Set Records In Next 5 Years: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
Global temperatures are likely to soar to record highs over the next five years, driven by human-caused warming and a climate pattern known as El Niño, forecasters at the World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday.
The record for Earth's hottest year was set in 2016. There is a 98 percent chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed that, the forecasters said, while the average from 2023 to '27 will almost certainly be the warmest for a five-year period ever recorded.
"This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment," said Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the meteorological organization. "We need to be prepared."
Why It Matters: Every fraction of a degree brings new risks.
Even small increases in warming can exacerbate the dangers from heat waves, wildfires, drought and other calamities, scientists say. Elevated global temperatures in 2021 helped fuel a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that shattered local records and killed hundreds of people.
El Niño conditions can cause further turmoil by shifting global precipitation patterns. The meteorological organization said it expected increased summer rainfall over the next five years in places like Northern Europe and the Sahel in sub-Saharan Africa and reduced rainfall in the Amazon and parts of Australia.
The organization reported that there is also a two thirds chance that one of the next five years could be 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the 19th-century average.
That does not mean that the world will have officially breached the aspirational goal in the Paris climate agreement of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. When scientists talk about that temperature goal, they generally mean a longer-term average over, say, two decades in order to root out the influence of natural variability.
Many world leaders have insisted on the 1.5-degree limit to keep the risks of climate change to tolerable levels. But nations have delayed so long in making the monumental changes necessary to achieve this goal, such as drastically cutting fossil-fuel emissions, that scientists now think the world will probably exceed that threshold around the early 2030s.
Background: La Niña, a cooling influence, is on the way out.
Global average temperatures have already increased roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century, largely because humans keep burning fossil fuels and pumping heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
But while that overall upward trend is clear, global temperatures can bounce up and down a bit from year to year because of natural variability. For instance, a cyclical phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, causes year-to-year fluctuations by shifting heat in and out of deeper ocean layers. Global surface temperatures tend to be somewhat cooler during La Niña years and somewhat hotter during El Niño years.
The last record hot year, 2016, was an El Niño year. By contrast, La Niña conditions have dominated for much of the past three years: while they've been unusually warm, they were still slightly below 2016 levels. Now, scientists are expecting El Niño conditions to return later this summer. When combined with steadily rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, that will most likely cause temperatures to accelerate to new highs.

Electric Work Vans Find Eager Buyers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Boudette, Neal E

Full text: Passenger cars dominate the electric vehicle market, but light delivery trucks could benefit from the cost savings and range E.V.s offer.
Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business last November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $ 110 to $ 140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance -- about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $ 9 a week.
"I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive," said Mr. Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Mo., just east of Kansas City. "But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate."
In the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of E.V.s were up 45 percent from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual E.V. sales total in the U.S. market to top one million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don't need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge.
One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in. Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning.
Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don't need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don't burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet commercial E.V.s have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Start-ups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a start-up backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and G.M., two of the country's largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford's Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the United States Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
G.M. created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022, and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.
Along with the truck, BrightDrop has developed an electric cart to enable drivers to haul many packages from the truck, reducing the number of trips the driver makes back and forth. One version of the cart is refrigerated for deliveries of produce and groceries.
In Hooksett, N.H., Merchants Fleet, a company that manages vehicles used by delivery services, has been using 150 BrightDrop vans over the past year, and is eager to add more.
Brad Jacobs, the company's vice president for fleet consulting, said the depreciation cost and the cost of interest on the capital used to buy electric vans were roughly the same as for combustion engine trucks.
"What we've learned from the vehicles on the road is that you save anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 a year because the cost of fuel and maintenance is so much lower with electric vehicles," he said. "If a company is planning on service life of five years, that's a savings of $ 50,000 per vehicle. That's very compelling."
Merchants Fleet has orders for 750 more BrightDrop trucks and reservations on an additional 17,000, Mr. Jacobs said.
Large delivery companies have been clamoring for electric trucks for years. Amazon hopes to buy as many as 100,000 vans from Rivian, and is considering an electric Ram ProMaster van that Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, is supposed to start making this year.
UPS has ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a start-up company based in Luxembourg that has operations in Britain. Arrival has suffered financial troubles and production delays. FedEx, plans to buy only battery-powered vans starting in 2030, and hopes to operate an all-electric fleet by 2040. It has been testing 150 BrightDrop trucks, is taking delivery on 350 more and has reservations for an additional 2,000.
Nelson Granados, a FedEx delivery driver in Inglewood, Calif., has been using a BrightDrop vehicle for the past year, a white van with the orange-and-purple FedEx logo next to a picture of a bright green plug and electric cord.
Mr. Granados gives the truck a thumbs-up. The truck has comforts the diesel vans lack like a stereo and heated seats, as well as a lower floor that makes entering and leaving easier.
"You're getting in and out all day, so it pays off," Mr. Granados said. "It's like a luxury delivery truck."
Mr. Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games -- he has season tickets -- so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Mr. Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he's reaping from the E-Transit.
"When I look at the cost over five years," he said with a laugh, "it's almost like getting a free van."

Full text: Fashion lovers flocked to shop from the star's collection of garments in what was advertised on social media as the "sale of the century."
For a certain kind of fashion fiend, it was a dream: shop the actress Chloë Sevigny's closet, with her present.
Ms. Sevigny, lauded as a fashion influencer and enthusiast, held a sale on Mother's Day in a studio space in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. Customers had the chance to buy items from Ms. Sevigny's own wardrobe, Academy New York, pieces she had designed with Opening Ceremony, and costumes from various roles.
"I decided to properly care for or store some things in Los Angeles," said Ms. Sevigny, who wore a black Comme des Garçons shirtdress and Manolo Blahnik slides. "And then there was a lot left over and I was like, you know what, I'm 48, I'm a mother, there's a lot of stuff I don't want to wear anymore. This is a big purge to pay for a few years of storage, give a chunk to a charity and pay for some more storage."
The event was organized by Liana Satenstein, a former Vogue writer whose "Schmatta Shrink" service helps fashionistas clear out their closets and has evolved into a video series called Never Worns, where she tells the stories behind those clothes.
The sale was announced on Thursday via Instagram, under the title "Sale of the Century." Ms. Sevigny was joined by the fashion editors Mickey Boardman (formerly of Paper Magazine), Lynn Yaeger (a contributing editor to Vogue) and Sally Singer (formerly of Vogue; now at Amazon), all hawking their clothes.
By noon, when the sale officially opened, a line snaked completely around the block; some customers had left their homes in New Jersey at 5:30 in the morning. "It's like ouroboros, or the human centipede of fashion," Ms. Satenstein said.
Mr. Boardman was seated in a side room with his friend Laura Wills, the owner of the vintage store Screaming Mimi's, while Ms. Singer ran the till, which was in fact mostly Venmo. Was this her first experience working retail? "Sadly, no," Ms. Singer said.
As the first customers charged out of the elevator, they had to pause. There was Ms. Sevigny, welcoming shoppers, gamely posing for selfies and doling out fashion advice. "You have to buy that," she told Bella Raykhman, a 24-year-old art director considering some $ 145 denim chaps by Katharine Hamnett.
Ms. Raykhman said, "It might have been a marketing strategy, but it was effective."
Ms. Sevigny held up a tiny leather miniskirt she said was from the 1990s. "It's Michael Kors for Celine," she said. "During my Oscar campaign for 'Boys Don't Cry,' I wore this to different press events." Nearby was a denim jacket and matching pants with a leafy print, a collaboration between Levi's and Supreme. "I dated a boy who worked at Supreme for a while, so I used to get hooked up," she said. "They still hook me up, because they like me."
While a lone speaker blared Britney Spears, Madonna and Sonic Youth, shoppers -- mostly women in their 20s -- browsed items like an Hermès shearling coat ( $ 1,995), a Lord & Taylor leather blazer ( $ 135) and black Supreme shorts with the Playboy bunny near the hem ( $ 150). "These are forever pieces in my closet," said Abby Tompkins, a 26-year-old music marketer. She came for "the essential New York It girl look," she said. "I'm already planning outfits in my head."
Asha McDonald, a 29-year-old stylist, was trying to decide between a plaid Vivienne Westwood skirt ( $ 450) and an armful of other items. The time had come to make a call. "It's either now or I'm going to get a bladder infection," she said. There were no restrooms.
Ms. Sevigny was still at the sale at 3, sorting clothes, moving mules from the floor to a more prominent rack where space had cleared up. Chelsea Manning stopped by, as well as Ivy Getty, a socialite and model, who admired a tiny sheer camisole dress in cyan. "That's Versace!" Ms. Sevigny yelled to her from a couch.
Ms. Sevigny stayed until the bitter end, with the sale extending its hours until 6 (it was supposed to end at 5), when the very last pilgrims made it through the door. Ms. Satenstein said later that about 90 percent of the clothes were sold.
"I thought more people would rip things out of people's hands," said Rebecca Snyder, 22, a student who had waited for more than four hours with her friends. "It honestly ended up being really chill. It's not that deep. It's just clothes."

Electric Vans, Delayed by Production Problems, Find Eager Buyers

Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business in November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $110 to $140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance — about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $9 a week.
“I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive,” said Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Missouri, just east of Kansas City. “But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate.”
In the auto industry’s transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of EVs were up 45% from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual EV sales total in the U.S. market to top 1 million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don’t need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge. One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in.
Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning. Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don’t need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don’t burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet, commercial EVs have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Startups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a startup backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and GM, two of the country’s largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford’s Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or as a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the U.S. Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
GM created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022 and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street sank Tuesday after Home Depot warned of flagging sales, the latest discouraging signal for an economy under pressure.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2 percent.
Energy producers were some of the heaviest weights on the market as Exxon Mobil shares dropped 2.4 percent and Chevron stock fell 2.3 percent.
Home Depot also fell 2.2 percent after saying its revenue weakened by more in the latest quarter than expected. It described broad-based pressures across its business after years of big growth, and it cut its forecast for sales this fiscal year.
Other big retailers are scheduled to report their results later this week, including Target and Walmart. They are under the microscope because resilient consumer spending has been one of the main positives keeping the economy from sliding into a recession. Measures of confidence among shoppers have been on the decline, and if spending buckles, a recession may be assured.
Manufacturing and other areas of the economy have already cracked under the weight of much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation.
A separate report on Tuesday said that spending at retailers across the country broadly rose last month, but not by as much as economists expected.
"There's often a gap between how people say they feel and how they spend their money, but the retail sales report shows people are beginning to cut back on big-ticket items and discretionary categories like sporting goods," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
Economists pointed to some brighter spots underneath the surface of the report on retail sales, including stronger-than-expected gains after removing fuel costs. A separate report released later in the morning also offered some encouraging data: The nation's industrial production unexpectedly grew in April.
Treasury yields in the bond market rose after the reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 3.55 percent from 3.51 percent late Monday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for action by the Federal Reserve, rose to 4.07 percent from 4.01 percent.
The wide expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will hold steady on interest rates in June for the first time in more than a year. A pause by the Fed could offer the economy and financial markets some breathing room.
Big tech and other high-growth stocks tend to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of easier interest rates, and they helped limit Wall Street's losses on Tuesday.
Amazon shares gained 2 percent, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, rallied 2.6 percent. They were the two strongest forces bolstering the S&P 500 when nearly 90 percent of the stocks in the index fell.
Also looming over Wall Street is the threat of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt for the first time. That could occur as early as June 1 unless Congress agrees to raise the credit limit set for the nation's borrowing.
The stakes are tremendous, and economists say failure to allow the federal government to borrow more could mean tremendous pain for both the economy and financial markets.
Most of Wall Street expects Washington to reach a deal because failure to do so would be so traumatic. But Congress has a history of waiting until the 11th hour on such matters.
In markets abroad, stocks in Shanghai fell 0.6 percent. China's economic recovery faces pressure from sluggish consumer and export demand, a government official said Tuesday, with retail sales and other activity in April weaker than expected.

To Be Seen As More Than Trans: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The transgender actress plays the title role in a new drama that, she says, is "not just a trans story, it's a family story."
Trace Lysette has no children but she is a mom. Or was: For about a decade she reigned as mother of the House of Mizrahi, a legendary house, as the voguers will tell you, in New York's ballroom scene.
The children she was a surrogate parent for still gush over the night in 2012 when she walked a ball dolled up like Marilyn Monroe, her hair bleached blonde and her fake fur cinched with a borrowed Comme des Garçons belt. A YouTube video from that evening shows her in command of a swooning throng.
In the new film "Monica" (in theaters), Lysette is consumed by a less fierce but equally potent expression of motherhood. She plays the title character, a transgender woman who reunites and uneasily reconciles with her estranged family as they care for their ailing mother (played by Patricia Clarkson), who doesn't recognize her daughter, at first.
"It's not just a trans story, it's a family story," Lysette said in a recent video interview from Los Angeles.
Leisurely directed by Andrea Pallaoro, the film is a big break for Lysette, herself a transgender woman and an actress best known for playing a stripper in "Hustlers" (2019) and a yoga teacher on "Transparent" (2014-2019), Amazon's dark comedy about a baby boomer transgender woman, played by Jeffrey Tambor.
"Monica" made waves at last year's Venice Film Festival, where it premiered to acclaim as the first movie with an openly transgender lead to compete there. Lysette is in almost every scene, captured by Pallaoro's camera in sometimes jarringly extreme detail.
Lysette said her favorite moment in the film is a tranquil one: Dressed in a bathing suit, Monica sits on a dock holding a baby in sunlight.
"It's such a beautiful portrait because it's so rare that you get to see a trans woman being maternal and being carefree," she said. It's one of many moments in "Monica" that Lysette hopes might change at least one mind as the film hits theaters during a politically treacherous moment for the transgender community.
"The only way we are going to get past this hate and messed-up legislation is if the other side can see themselves in us," she said.
In a phone interview, Clarkson said she quickly connected with Lysette, and the two developed an intimacy as near to mother and daughter as two strangers can be. In one heart-rending scene, as Monica bathes her mother, the two women have a nonverbal moment of recognition -- an example of how Lysette is "capable of a piercing stillness," said Clarkson.
"Great actors, like Trace, when they're called upon to enter incredibly deep and dark emotional places, have to be willing to let their unique selves come through," she said. "The body can put up guards and filters every day. But when she arrived on set, she was completely available and breathtaking."
When asked what people should know about Lysette, Alexandra Billings, Lysette's "Transparent" co-star, said: "She's one of the smartest people I've ever met."
"When you look at her, because we are a culture so full of misogyny, we think there's no way there can be a brain attached," said Billings by phone. "Every single piece of advice she's given me was spot-on."
As for parallels between Monica's life and her own, Lysette said that after a challenging few years, she's in "a good place" with her own mother, who she came out to as transgender when Lysette was in her teens.
"The tool kit that parents had in the '90s is not the same tool kit they have to deal with their children coming out as trans in 2023," said Lysette, who gave her age as "on the cusp of Gen X and Millennial." "What I realize is that my mom did the best she could. I forgave my mom a long time ago."
Lysette was born in Kentucky but grew up in Dayton, Ohio, where she started doing drag in high school before performing at area clubs with drag queens and transgender women working in a drag context. Nightlife was where she met her transgender godmother of sorts, the entertainer Jareje Rashad, "the spitting image of Toni Braxton," as Lysette put it, before moving to New York at 20. "It was a magical moment when I met her," Lysette said. "There was a seed planted."
In conversation, Lysette has an accentuate-the-positive outlook -- remnants of a Midwestern politesse, perhaps -- that she admitted to using to find good in even the darkest memories. That was the case as she discussed "Transparent." Lysette was one of several actresses who in 2017 claimed Tambor sexually harassed her on set, accusing him in a statement of having "made many sexual advances and comments." It was amid those allegations that Tambor left the show after the fourth season.
When asked to reflect on "Transparent," Lysette took a long pause, then said: "I'm grateful that I got to be on such a critically acclaimed show. I learned a lot from watching Judith Light work. I think it's part of the timeline of trans representation. Was it perfect? No. But it did open the door for a lot of other things."
Yet when asked to assess the opportunities for transgender actors in a post-"Pose" world -- in which the popular show about ballroom culture made transgender actors and characters household names -- her grade was "D minus."
"There are a lot of people who talk the talk but don't walk the walk in terms of greenlighting trans stories, with us creating them, producing them, starring in them," she said. "I really think the industry as a whole doesn't quite understand what they're missing."
Lysette is back auditioning, and as she enters each room she said she hopes to be seen "as a leading lady and not just as a trans actor."
"I want them to say, she's studied her craft, she's put in the work and that it's been a slow boil, not a microwave," she said. "And that she's ready for more."

Chris Messina Takes Flight: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Marsh, Calum

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The "actor's actor" ad-libbed so many funny threats that the movie star couldn't keep a straight face and resorted to improvisation to keep up.
Chris Messina has a hard time admitting that he's funny.
Even after his hilarious turn as a silver-tongued sports agent in "Air" and six seasons as a drolly charming doctor on the sitcom "The Mindy Project," he is surprisingly self-critical when it comes to his comic abilities.
"Comedy is so hard," he said in a recent video call from his home in Los Angeles, adding an expletive for emphasis. "It's hard to land a joke. So I still struggle with that. I'm best when I either don't know it's a comedy or don't play it as a comedy -- then you might find me funny."
This is difficult to believe if you've seen "Air." As Michael Jordan's outrageous, surly representative David Falk in the story of the creation of the Air Jordan sneaker, Messina is uproarious, screaming and swearing his way through fever-pitch negotiations with voluble panache. In the most memorable exchange, Messina calls the Nike scout and marketer Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) to lambaste him for secretly visiting the Jordan family. Messina goes utterly ballistic, hurtling around his office as he barks threats and insults involving various bits of bodily anatomy. The Ringer described him as the film's "foul-mouthed" M.V.P.
"Phone calls are usually just a bore," Messina said thoughtfully, displaying an open and eager friendliness, pleased to be discussing the details of a craft he clearly loves. "There's no one on the other line -- sometimes there's a script supervisor reading the lines off-camera."
But for "Air," the director Ben Affleck had the idea to shoot both sides of the conversation simultaneously. He set up Damon and Messina in offices down the hall from each other, and had two sets of cameras rolling at the same time. "It felt more alive," Messina said. "Matt and I could talk over each other, then we could improvise, then we could come together and say, 'How about we change this to this?' And then go back to our offices and keep going."
As Affleck told me in a recent phone interview, "All of the great lines in that scene are Chris's improvisation." And those improvisations, he said, had a particularly strong impact on Damon. "Matt could not keep a straight face. I had to use Matt laughing because there wasn't a take of him playing it straight. He tried to play it straight, and he just couldn't."
Damon explained that "it was already really funny on the page." But when Messina came up with threats, "it dictated how I had to play the scene," Damon said. "I had to start ad-libbing. I started talking to the background artists next to me, going, 'It's David Falk on the phone, sorry,' and I just started laughing."
"Air" is Messina's third appearance in an Affleck-directed film, after the Oscar-winning drama "Argo" and the period crime tale "Live by Night." Affleck said, "I always look for work for Chris because he's always so good. Every time he's had the opportunity, he's always done more than I envisioned or imagined."
Though "Live by Night" was not a commercial success, Affleck said he was "particularly proud" of Messina's performance, for which he gained 40 pounds. "I said he could wear a body suit. He said no, it wouldn't be the same," Affleck said. "I can't say enough good things about him."
Damon echoed the sentiment, describing his co-star as an actor's actor, the kind "all the other actors always talk about. Did you see him in this? Or, he's in that, that'll be good."
Messina's career started on the stage. A "tried and true New York theater actor" from Long Island, as he put it, he plied his trade "mostly Off Broadway, and Off Off Broadway, and sometimes Off Off Off Broadway, in the Bronx and in Queens and on the Lower East Side." He speaks of those scrappy early days with a nostalgic air, reminiscing about plays "where the actors outnumbered the audience, or where, when it rained, it would leak on the stage," he said. In short, he loved it.
For a long time, Messina yearned to find glory the romantic way. "I really thought, stupidly, that Mike Nichols would discover me in a play and put me in 'The Graduate 2,' you know? I had read about Dustin Hoffman. But that never happened."
Instead, Messina transitioned to the screen. After a couple of small, forgettable parts in films like "Rounders" (with Damon) and "The Siege," he landed his breakout role, on the final season of the funeral-home drama "Six Feet Under," playing the amiable, strait-laced lawyer Ted Fairwell, the love interest of Lauren Ambrose's Claire. On the strength of his work on that HBO drama, he began landing high-profile films, including Sam Mendes's "Away We Go" and Woody Allen's "Vicky Cristina Barcelona," as well as recurring parts on the cable dramas "Damages" and "The Newsroom."
Most viewers, though, probably know Messina best for his work on "The Mindy Project," starring as the sometimes ill-tempered, sometimes charismatic Danny Castellano opposite the series creator, Mindy Kaling. When casting began in 2011, Kaling was specifically seeking actors she "hadn't seen do a lot of comedy" or, if they were experienced, "weren't the usual suspects they always send you," she said in a recent interview.
She knew he was perfect straight away. Describing him as one of the most comical actors she's worked with, she said Messina was "so rooted in the truth of his character that he can't help but be funny."
She attributes that expressly to the fact that he is not a traditional comedian. "Your average sitcom actor wants to hit their moments, make the day, and go home. Chris isn't like that," she said. "It's almost exhausting, the level of honesty and truth he brings to every scene. He was really listening to my character and reacting if the character did something funny or absurd. He made me a better actor. I was listening better when I was with Chris, because he set the bar so high."
Although Messina proved well suited for the role, he originally didn't even want to do it, turning down the part multiple times before relenting. ("Mindy wouldn't take no for an answer," he explained.) He was, he said, "very worried about every aspect of it," including the commitment to a network comedy with 20-plus episodes per season, potentially for many years -- perhaps making it more difficult for him to do the kind of serious work he dreamed of as a performer.
"I wanted to do 'Dog Day Afternoon.' I wanted to do 'Midnight Cowboy,"' he said. Though he liked the role and Kaling, "I was afraid of it running forever." And, of course, he was afraid of something else: the genre. "I was afraid of not being able to keep up with them comedically," he said. "I am afraid of jokes."
On the other hand, being afraid is what Messina wants. "Being scared of a role, of an opportunity, being challenged, that's what I'm looking for. Maybe it's corny or too actorly, but I do like finding closed doors inside of me."

Labor Victory in South With a Vote to Unionize: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Friday's victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor.
Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South.
The company, Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Ga., may lack the cachet of Amazon or the ubiquity of Starbucks, two other corporations that have attracted union attention. But the 697-to-435 vote by Blue Bird's workers to join the United Steelworkers was the first significant organizing election at a factory receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by President Biden.
"This is just a bellwether for the future, particularly in the South, where working people have been ignored," Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Friday evening after the vote. "We are now in a place where we have the investments coming in and a strategy for lifting up wages and protections for a good high-road future."
The three bills making up that investment include a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change.
Each of the bills included language to help unions expand their membership, and Blue Bird's management, which opposed the union drive, had to contend with the Democrats' subtle assistance to the Steelworkers.
Blue Bird stands to benefit from the new federal funds. Last year, it hailed the $ 500 million that the Biden administration was providing through the infrastructure bill for the replacement of diesel-powered school buses with zero- and low-emission buses. Georgia school systems alone will get $ 51.1 million to buy new electric buses, but Blue Bird sells its buses across the country. Still more money will come through the Inflation Reduction Act, another law praised by the company.
But that money came with strings attached -- strings that subtly tilted the playing field toward the union. Just two weeks ago, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, pushed a demand on all recipients of federal subsidies to detail the health insurance, paid leave, retirement and other benefits they were offering their workers.
They also required the companies to have "committed to remain neutral in any organizing campaign and/or to voluntarily recognize a union based on a show of majority support." And under the rules of the infrastructure bill, no federal money may to be used to thwart a union election.
The Steelworkers union used the rules to its advantage. In late April, it filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against Blue Bird's management, citing $ 40 million in rebates the company had received from the E.P.A., which stipulated that those funds could not be used for anti-union activity.
"The rules say if workers want a union, you can't use any money to hire anti-union law firms, or use people to scare workers," Daniel Flippo, director of the Steelworkers district that covers the Southeast, said before the vote. "I'm convinced Blue Bird has done that."
Politicians also got involved. Georgia's two Democratic senators and southwestern Georgia's Democratic House member also subtly nudged the plant's management, in a union-hostile but politically pivotal state, to at least keep the election fair.
"I have been a longtime supporter of the USW and its efforts to improve labor conditions and living standards for workers in Georgia," the Democratic congressman, Representative Sanford Bishop, wrote of the United Steelworkers in an open letter to Blue Bird workers. "I want to encourage you in your effort to exercise your rights granted by the National Labor Relations Act."
Blue Bird's management minimized such pressure in its public statements, even as it fought hard to beat back union organizers.
"Although we respect and support the right for employees to choose, we do not believe that Blue Bird is better served by injecting a labor union into our relationship with employees," said Julianne Barclay, a spokeswoman for the company. "During the pending election campaign, we have voiced our opinion to our employees that a union is not in the best interest of the company or our employees."
Friday's union victory has the labor movement thinking big as the federal money continues to flow, and that could be good for Mr. Biden and other Democrats, especially in the pivotal state of Georgia.
"Workers at places like Blue Bird, in many ways, embody the future," Mr. Flippo said after the vote, adding, "For too long, corporations cynically viewed the South as a place where they could suppress wages and working conditions because they believed they could keep workers from unionizing."
The Blue Bird union shop, 1,400 workers strong, will be one of the biggest in the South, and union leaders said it could be a beachhead as they eyed new electric vehicle suppliers moving in -- and potentially the biggest, most difficult targets: foreign electric vehicle makers like Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which have located in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina in part to avoid unions.
"Companies move there for a reason -- they want as smooth a path toward crushing unions as possible," said Steve Smith, a national spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "But we have federal money rolling in, a friendly administration and a chance to make inroads like we have never had before."
The Blue Bird plant, which rises suddenly off a rural highway lined with peach and pecan orchards, has long made it a practice to hire less educated workers, some of whom have prison records and most of whom start at $ 16 or $ 17 an hour, said Alex Perkins, a main organizer for the United Steelworkers in Georgia.
A union was a tough sell for such vulnerable workers against a management that was fiercely opposed, organizers conceded. Coming off the last shift of the day on Thursday, most workers declined to speak on the record. A clutch of about a dozen workers stood on Friday at the Circle K gas station across the street from the plant in the predawn darkness, holding pro-union signs as the first workers arrived to cast ballots under the gaze of National Labor Relations Board monitors.
But Cynthia Harden, who has worked at the plant for five years and voted in favor of organizing, did talk about the pressure workers were under to vote against it. Slide shows on the voting process, which showed ballots marked "no," said that the company could go broke if the union won, and there was a sudden appearance of food trucks at lunch and banners on the perimeter fence reading, "We Love Our Employees!"
"They've made some changes already, but if the union hadn't started, nothing would have happened," she said.
The letter that Georgia's Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, wrote to Matt Stevenson, Blue Bird's chief executive and president, was remarkably timid, praising the company for its cooperation and its well-paying jobs before "encouraging all involved, whatever their desired outcome, to make sure that the letter and the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act are followed."
Mr. Perkins fumed at that tone, considering the work that unions had put in to help Mr. Warnock win re-election last year. "I won't forget it next time," he said.
Both senators declined requests to comment on the election.

Worries Roil Below Surface on Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Another seemingly listless week on Wall Street came to a quiet close on Wall Street Friday, but big worries continue to roil under the surface.
The S&P 500 dipped 6.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,124.08 to cap a sixth straight week where it moved by less than 1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 8.89, or less than 0.1 percent, to 33,300.62, while the Nasdaq composite lost 43.76, or 0.4 percent, to 12,284.74.
Despite the seemingly placid moves for the overall market, big swings have swirled underneath the surface amid worries about a possible recession, high inflation and the U.S. government inching toward what could be a catastrophic default on its debt.
It's not just Wall Street that's concerned. Sentiment among U.S. consumers is tumbling, according to a preliminary survey by the University of Michigan. That's a worry because strong spending by consumers has been one of the main forces preventing a recession as the economy slows.
Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, pointed to the looming June 1 deadline when the U.S. government could run out of cash to pay its bills unless Congress allows it to borrow more.
"If policymakers fail to resolve the debt ceiling crisis, these dismal views over the economy will exacerbate the dire economic consequences of default," she said in a statement.
President Biden and congressional leaders postponed a meeting set for Friday on the debt limit crisis to next week. The delay was billed as a sign of positive exchanges, and staff-level talks are expected to continue through the weekend.
One area under heavy pressure this week looking to stabilize was PacWest Bancorp's stock. It's been under heavy scrutiny as Wall Street hunts for the next possible U.S. bank to fail following three high-profile collapses since March.
PacWest fell 3 percent after flipping from a gain in the morning. A day earlier, it slid sharply after disclosing a flight of deposits from the prior week. Its stock lost 21 percent this past week.
Banks have been bending under the weight of much higher interest rates, which have caused some customers to pull deposits in search of higher yields while also dragging down prices for the investments that the banks hold.
Rates are so high because the Federal Reserve has been hiking them at a furious pace in order to drive down inflation. Reports this week suggested inflation is continuing to moderate from its peak last year, though it remains way too high for the comfort of households and regulators.
The hope on Wall Street is that easing inflation may convince the Fed to hold off on raising rates again at its next meeting in June. That would offer some breathing room to both the economy, which has slowed under the weight of higher rates, and to financial markets, where prices began falling long ago.
One potential wild card arrived in Friday's report on consumer sentiment. It suggested U.S. households are girding for 3.2 percent inflation over the long run. That's higher than last month's reading of 3 percent and the highest level since 2011.
One worry at the Fed is that if expectations for high inflation become entrenched, it could change behaviors by shoppers and others across the economy that only worsens inflation.
Treasury yields rose in the bond market following the consumer-sentiment report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury erased an earlier dip and climbed to 3.47 percent from 3.39 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 3.99 percent from 3.90 percent.
News Corp. rose 8.5 percent after it reported a milder drop in profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
That's been the trend this earnings reporting season. Reports have been better than feared but still weaker than a year earlier. Companies in the S&P 500 are on track to report a second straight quarter of drops in earnings per share, something that's called an "earnings recession."
First Solar soared 26.5 percent after announcing it's purchasing Evolar AB, a European company, to accelerate its development of high efficiency tandem devices and other technologies.
On the losing end of Wall Street was Gen Digital, which fell 5.5 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected.
Several big tech stocks were also weak. High-growth stocks are seen as some of the hardest hit by high interest rates. Amazon fell 1.7 percent and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.

BTS Plans To Publish Oral History Of the Group: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The announcement by their U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, came after days of frantic speculation by their fervent fans.
The K-pop juggernaut BTS will release an oral history of the group in South Korea and the United States on July 9, its U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, said on Thursday.
The book, "Beyond The Story: 10-Year Record of BTS," was written by the journalist Myeongseok Kang and members of the group, and it will be published in South Korea by Big Hit Music.
The news confirms intense fan speculation over several days that Flatiron would publish a nonfiction title about a pop culture phenomenon this summer. The rumor spread once booksellers in the United States noticed last weekend that a mystery title with a July 9 release date was coming. It had an initial print run of one million copies and required booksellers to sign an affidavit to stock copies on publication day.
Fans searched for clues of who the mystery author might be, zeroing in at first on Taylor Swift and citing her frequent use of the number 13 as evidence. (The book's original announcement was slated for June 13.) Swift had also highlighted the date July 9 in her most recent album announcement.
But June 13 and July 9 are also significant dates in the BTS community. The group debuted on the first date, and BTS's passionate fan base, Army -- which stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth -- was founded on the second. The book's release will coincide with the fan group's 10th anniversary.
As speculations mounted, preorders drove the still-untitled book up best-seller lists at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
The English translation of the book was led by Anton Hur, in collaboration with Clare Richards and Slin Jung. The U.S. edition will be 544 pages and contain exclusive photographs, according to Flatiron, and will have a first printing of one million copies.
The group's powerful, very online fandom has become famous worldwide, known for supporting the group by buying multiple versions of each physical release and running intricately coordinated social media campaigns. Devotees also assist each other by translating BTS content into English and other languages and providing robust fan communities.
It is difficult to overstate BTS's influence, in music and beyond. Last year, the seven members of the group -- RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook -- visited the White House to speak against anti-Asian American hate crimes.
Since 2013, BTS has released nine albums and six EPs and helped K-pop become a dominant global force. In 2018, the group became the first K-pop act to hit No. 1 on Billboard's album chart with "Love Yourself: Tear," a feat it repeated twice in 2019 with "Love Yourself: Answer" and "Map of the Soul: Persona" -- matching a record set by the Beatles.
In June 2022, after yet another No. 1 album -- the three-disc compilation "Proof" -- BTS released a video on social media announcing it was going on hiatus so its members could focus on solo creative projects. "I should be writing about what I'm feeling and the stories I want to tell," Suga said, "but I'm just forcefully squeezing out words because I need to satisfy someone." The clip drew more than 16 million views in two days. In October of last year, the group's label confirmed that its members would enlist in South Korea's military as required by law. Some of them already have.
The hiatus was devastating news not only for BTS's fervent fan base, but also for the entertainment business. The day after the news broke, the stock price for Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company behind the group, dropped 28 percent, which shaved $ 1.7 billion off its market value. As the group's popularity has grown, it has become a pillar of South Korea's economy, contributing $ 3.5 billion annually by 2020, according to the Hyundai Research Institute.
Many fans say that while they are drawn to BTS's music and performances, they are also inspired by its messages of love and acceptance, which have led some to become more politically active. "They're really, really passionate people who just fight for what they love," Nicole Santero, a fan who ran a data-focused BTS Twitter account, told The Times in 2020. "Those characteristics translate well when you look at social issues."

Wall St. Muddles Through Inflation Report: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-st-muddles-through-inflation-report/docview/2811808125/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A mixed day of trading left Wall Street slightly higher on Wednesday after a report showed inflation is making strides toward easing, even if it remains high.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent after swinging between gains and losses through the day. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq composite rallied by 1 percent.
Bond prices climbed after the highly anticipated report said inflation at the consumer level edged down to 4.9 percent last month, its lowest level in two years. That was slightly better than economists expected, and other underlying measures of inflation also came in very close to forecasts.
Because of that, Wall Street still sees the door open for the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone at its next meeting in June. That would be the first time it hasn't raised rates at a meeting in more than a year, and a pause would offer some breathing room for the economy and financial markets.
"The concern coming in was that it would be hotter than feared," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. "While not exactly an exciting report, I think there was enough good news baked in that it shouldn't impact the Fed or the economic trajectory all that much."
The Fed has jacked up rates at a furious pace in hopes of driving down inflation. But high rates do that by slowing the entire economy and hitting investment prices broadly. They've already sent stock prices tumbling, caused turmoil in the banking system and dragged on the economy enough that many investors expect a recession to hit this year.
Following the report, traders raised the probability they see of the Fed holding rates steady in June to nearly 94 percent, according to data from CME Group.
Stocks that benefit the most from an easing of interest rates led the way on Wall Street, including Big Tech and other high-growth stocks. Amazon's 3.3 percent rise and Microsoft's 1.7 percent climb were the two biggest forces lifting the S&P 500.
On the losing end of Wall Street, Lincoln National fell 3.9 percent after reporting weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected.
Airbnb dropped 10.9 percent despite reporting profit that matched analysts' forecasts. It gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that were weaker than some on Wall Street expected.
Most companies in the S&P 500 have topped profit forecasts so far this reporting season, which is approaching its final stretch. But they're still on pace to report an overall drop in earnings from a year earlier, which would be the second straight quarter that has happened.
Icahn Enterprises, the partnership run by the activist investor Carl Icahn, sank 15.1 percent after disclosing that federal prosecutors asked for information related to its corporate governance and other matters.
The request from the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York came a day after a short-selling research firm, Hindenburg Research, accused Icahn Enterprises of inflating the value of some of its investments. Icahn called the accusations misleading and self-serving and published a rebuttal Wednesday.
In the bond market, increased hopes for a coming pause from the Fed on rates pushed yields lower.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.43 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.9 percent.
Besides worries about interest rates and inflation, some corners of the bond market are also swinging on concerns about the U.S. government inching closer to a possible default on its debt. That has never happened before, and economists warn that a default could be catastrophic for the economy and financial markets.

LinkedIn Opts To Pare Down China Presence Amid Adversity: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft, LinkedIn's owner, had already pulled the flagship networking site from China in 2021, leaving only a stripped-down app that catered to job seekers.
LinkedIn, the networking platform used by millions of employees and companies, said on Monday it will pare down its operations in China, capping a multiyear pullback that exemplified the challenges of running a foreign business in China.
The company, owned by Microsoft, said it will lay off 716 employees worldwide, including teams dedicated to engineering and marketing in China, because of slumping demand. It did not say how many of those layoffs will be in China.
LinkedIn will also shut its China job posting app, a bare-bones version of its international service, by August. Users of the app, called InCareer, could only search for jobs and not post or share articles the way they can on LinkedIn.
When LinkedIn started a Chinese-language version of its website in 2014, it charted a path that its peers, including Facebook and Google, had shied away from. It partnered with local firms and began censoring the content of millions of Chinese customers in accordance with Beijing's strict laws. Several U.S. journalists and activists said their profiles had been blocked because of "prohibited content." The company said at the time that while it opposed government censorship, its absence in the country could deprive Chinese professionals of the chance to make professional connections.
Yet over the years, the challenges for foreign and domestic social media platforms multiplied as the power of China's censorship machine ballooned under its leader, Xi Jinping. In 2021, LinkedIn closed its flagship networking service in China, citing compliance issues and a "significantly more challenging operating environment."
In a letter to employees, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn's chief executive, said the cuts were prompted by slower revenue growth and fluctuations in customer behavior. The news follows an overall slowdown in tech that has led to tens of thousands of layoffs this year by the largest companies, including Amazon, Meta and Google.
LinkedIn, which employs about 20,000 people, said Monday that while it was reducing operations in China and other countries, it plans to create 250 jobs in other areas.
Mr. Roslansky said it will retain a presence in China to help companies operating in the country hire and train employees from overseas.

Insurers Add Primary Care To Portfolios: [Correction]

Author: Abelson, Reed

Publication info: Abelson, Reed.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Large health insurers and other companies are especially keen on doctors' groups that care for patients in private Medicare plans.
It's no surprise that the shortage of primary care doctors -- who are critically important to the health of Americans -- is getting worse.
They practice in one of medicine's lowest paid, least glamorous fields. Most are overworked, seeing as many as 30 people a day; figuring out when a sore throat is a strep infection, or managing a patient's chronic diabetes.
So why are multibillion-dollar corporations, particularly giant health insurers, gobbling up primary care practices? CVS Health, with its sprawling pharmacy business and ownership of the major insurer Aetna, paid roughly $ 11 billion to buy Oak Street Health, a fast-growing chain of primary care centers that employs doctors in 21 states. And Amazon's bold purchase of One Medical, another large doctors' group, for nearly $ 4 billion, is another such move.
The appeal is simple: Despite their lowly status, primary care doctors oversee vast numbers of patients, who bring business and profits to a hospital system, a health insurer or a pharmacy outfit eyeing expansion.
And there's an added lure: The growing privatization of Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, means that more than half its 60 million beneficiaries have signed up for policies with private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program. The federal government is now paying those insurers $ 400 billion a year.
"That's the big pot of money everyone is aiming at," said Erin C. Fuse Brown, director of the Center for Law, Health & Society at Georgia State University, and an author of a New England Journal of Medicine article about corporate investment in primary care. "It's a one-stop shop for all your health care dollars," she said.
Many doctors say they are becoming mere employees. "We've seen this loss of autonomy," said Dr. Dan Moore, who recently decided to start his own practice in Henrico, Va., to have more say in caring for his patients. "You don't become a physician to spend an average of seven minutes with a patient," he said.
The absorption of doctor practices is part of a vast, accelerating consolidation of medical care, leaving patients in the hands of a shrinking number of giant companies or hospital groups. Many already were the patients' insurers and controlled the distribution of medicines through ownership of drugstore chains or pharmacy benefit managers. But now, nearly seven in 10 of all doctors are either employed by a hospital or a corporation, according to a recent analysis from the Physicians Advocacy Institute.
The companies say these new arrangements will bring better, more coordinated care for patients, but some experts warn the consolidation will lead to higher prices and systems driven by the quest for profits, not patients' welfare.
Insurers say their purchase of medical practices is a step toward what is called value-based care, with the insurer and doctor paid a flat fee to care for an individual patient. The fixed payment acts as a financial incentive to keep patients healthy, provide more access to early care and reduce hospital admissions and expensive visits to specialists.
The companies say they favor the fixed fees over the existing system that pays doctors and hospitals for every test and treatment, encouraging doctors to order too many procedures.
Under Medicare Advantage, doctors often share profits with insurers if the doctors take on the financial risk of a patient's care, earning more if they can save on treatment. Instead of receiving a few hundred dollars for an office visit, primary care doctors can be paid as much as $ 14,000 a year to manage a single patient.
But experts warn these major acquisitions threaten the personal nature of the doctor-patient relationship, especially if the parent company has the authority to dictate limits on services from the first office visit to extended hospital stays. Once enrolled, these new customers can be steered toward chains of related businesses, like a CVS drugstore or Amazon's online pharmacy.
UnitedHealth Group is a sprawling example of consolidated services. It owns the major insurer that has nearly 50 million customers in the United States and oversees its ever-expanding subsidiary, Optum, which has bought up networks of doctors and medical sites. Optum can send patients from one of its roughly 70,000 doctors to one of its urgent care or surgery centers.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is urging the Federal Trade Commission to take a closer look at some of these large deals, which regulators have so far not blocked on antitrust grounds. "I fear that the acquisition of thousands of independent providers by a few massive health care mega-conglomerates could reduce competition on a local or national basis, hurting patients and increasing health care costs," she wrote to regulators in March.
This consolidation of medical care may also run afoul of state laws that prohibit what is called corporate medicine. Such statutes prevent a company that employs doctors from interfering with patient treatment.
And experts warn of the potential harm to patients, when corporate management seeks to control costs through byzantine systems requiring prior authorization to receive care.
For example, Kaiser Permanente, the giant nonprofit health plan that has exclusive contracts with physician groups, settled a malpractice case for nearly $ 2.9 million last year with the family of Ken Flach, a former tennis player who contracted pneumonia and died from sepsis after a Kaiser nurse and doctor would not send him for an in-person visit or to the emergency room, despite the urgent pleading of his wife. Kaiser said medical decisions are made by its providers in consultation with their patients and said its "deepest sympathy remains with the Flach family."
Doctors also chafe at oversight that does not benefit patients. "They are trying to run it like a business, but it's not a business," said Dr. Beth Kozak, an internal medicine doctor in Grand Rapids, Mich.
Her doctors' group has teamed up with Agilon Health, an investor-owned company, to work with Medicare Advantage plans. Dr. Kozak said she has to work longer hours, not to provide better care, but to supply additional diagnoses for patients, which increases federal reimbursements under the Medicare Advantage program. "It's not because I'm giving better patient care," she said. "It's all tied to the billing."
The corporate consumption of medical care keeps growing. Walgreens Boots Alliance, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy operations, spent $ 5 billion for a majority stake in VillageMD, a primary care group, and teamed with Cigna to buy another medical group for nearly $ 9 billion. And short of an outright purchase, UnitedHealth is partnering with Walmart to offer care to older patients.
In promoting the benefits of buying Oak Street clinics to investors, Karen S. Lynch, the chief executive of CVS Health, said primary care doctors lower medical costs. "Primary care drives patient engagement and positive clinical outcomes," she said.
Many of these companies are building chains of clinics. On a recent tour of an Oak Street clinic in Bushwick, one of 16 centers opened since October 2020 in New York City, patients were typically seen from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a nurse available after hours to field questions.
Ann Greiner, the chief executive of the Primary Care Collaborative, a nonprofit group, defended the recent forays by private companies into this field of health care, saying they are infusing practices with sorely needed funds and may improve access to care for people in underserved areas.
"The salaries of the folks in those arrangements are higher," she said. "They are providing more comprehensive care in many of those arrangements. They are providing more tech and more team-based care. That's all investment."
But these deals also risk shifting the balance from quality treatment to profits, she said.
In recent years, some have invoked the laws banning corporate medicine to challenge these large-scale private operations. Envision Healthcare, a private equity-backed company that employs emergency room doctors, is being sued in California by a unit of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, a professional group that supports independent practices, accusing it of violating that state's provisions.
"Envision exercises profound and pervasive direct and indirect control and/or influence over physicians practice of medicine," according to the lawsuit. The suit maintains that Envision controls the doctors' billing and establishes medical protocols.
While Envision would not comment on the litigation, it said it "follows an operating structure that is common across the health care sector and widely used by nonprofit, privately held and public groups as well as hospitals and insurers."
The big insurers find doctors' groups particularly attractive, although many have reported sizable losses. The acquisition of Oak Street, which has lost more than $ 1 billion over the last three years, could help CVS's Medicare Advantage plans improve their quality or "star" ratings and increase payments for one of its plans.
Even small numbers of patients can translate into significant revenue. One Medical, the company Amazon owns, is best known for sleek clinics. The company scooped up a practice specializing in Medicare Advantage. Only about 5 percent of One Medical's 836,000 members are enrolled in that federal program, but roughly half of its revenue comes from that tiny slice of patients, according to its 2022 financial statements.
Regulators are already flagging questionable methods employed by some practices. In November 2021, Oak Street disclosed that the Justice Department was investigating sales ploys like free trips to its clinics and payment of insurance agents for referrals. One doctor at a center described recruiting patients with "gift cards, swag and goody bags," according to a shareholder lawsuit against Oak Street.
The lawsuit detailed concerns that doctors were inflating the payments from the federal government by overstating how sick their patients were.
Oak Street says it has not been accused of any wrongdoing by the Justice Department and says the lawsuit is "without merit."
These private Medicare Advantage plans have been heavily criticized for racking up enormous profits by inflating costs and exaggerating patients' illnesses to charge the government more than they should.
Under new rules, the Biden administration would eliminate some of the most problematic, overused diagnoses, and doctors and insurers could earn less.
But other pathways to profit also explain why corporations covet these deals. Unlike the caps on insurers' moneymaking, where a Medicare Advantage insurer has to spend at least 85 cents of every dollar on patient care, there are no limits to how much profit these doctor practices and pharmacy chains can make.
It may be too soon to determine whether consolidated care will improve patients' health. "So far, when you look across the industry, the record of these acquisitions has been mixed," said Dr. Sachin H. Jain, the chief executive of SCAN Group, a nonprofit based in Long Beach, Calif., that offers Medicare Advantage plans.
And the investments may not halt the rapid disappearance of the doctor still sought by so many people for ordinary care, including a recent report showing fewer medical school graduates going into the field.
"We're dealing with incredible levels of burnout within the profession," said Dr. Max Cohen, who practices near Portland, Ore. Since the pandemic, his low-income patients have become much sicker, he said, with the level of illness "through the roof."

Dark Lord of Literature, Tolkien's Sauron, Has Genus of Butterflies Named in His Honor: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The distinctive marks on the newly identified insects resemble the baleful eye of Sauron, the dark lord in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy series.
A new genus of butterfly, with dark, eye-like spots on its distinctive orange wings, has been named after Sauron, the arch-villain of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy epic "The Lord of the Rings," whose gaze lingers malevolently over the lands of Middle-earth.
An international team of scientists identified two species in the new genus -- Saurona triangula and Saurona aurigera -- but said there were most likely more, the Natural History Museum in London announced on Sunday.
Blanca Huertas, the senior curator of butterflies at the museum, helped name the genus, which is one of nine new ones described by the researchers in a paper in the most recent issue of the journal Systematic Entomology.
The practice of naming new species after celebrities, fictional characters and others has a long history, and "giving these butterflies an unusual name helps to draw attention to this underappreciated group," Dr. Blanca said. "It shows that, even among a group of very similar-looking species, you can find beauty among the dullness."
Found in the southwestern Amazon rainforest, the Saurona butterflies are part of a group called Euptychiina, which are difficult to distinguish simply by their physical characteristics. The scientists used genetic sequencing to help tell the new species apart.
"It's important to study groups like the Euptychiina because it reveals that there are many species we didn't know about," Dr. Blanca said. "Some of these species are threatened with extinction, and so there's a lot to do now we can put a name to them."
Butterfly populations around the world are threatened by the loss of habitat and the effects of climate change. The monarch butterfly (or Danaus plexippus, which is not based on a Tolkien character) was classified as endangered last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Tolkien often depicted Sauron as a disembodied, all-seeing eye, writing in 1954's "The Fellowship of the Ring": "The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing." Film adaptations followed suit.
In addition to the newly designated butterflies, Sauron has a namesake dinosaur, a dung beetle and a frog, according to the Natural History Museum. There's also NGC 4151, a faraway galaxy that astronomers have dubbed "the eye of Sauron."
Tolkien's characters have long provided a rich source of inspiration for taxonomists, including a subterranean fish named for the cave-dwelling Gollum; a crab found in New Zealand -- the filming location for the "Lord of the Rings" movies of the early 2000s -- that was named for the wizard Gandalf; and the moss-forest blossom bat, a.k.a. Syconycteris hobbit.

A.P. and The Times Earn Pulitzers for Ukraine War Coverage: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Several news organizations won multiple awards, including The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and AL.com, a site that covers Alabama.
Coverage of the war in Ukraine dominated the Pulitzer Prizes on Monday, with The Associated Press winning two awards for its reporting and photography, including the prestigious public service prize, and The New York Times winning for a mix of news and investigative articles about the conflict.
The Times also won for illustrated reporting and commentary, for a piece by Mona Chalabi in The Times Magazine examining the wealth of Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos.
The A.P.'s journalists were the last from an international news organization to remain in the Ukrainian city Mariupol after it came under fire from Russian troops. They documented its fall before escaping. In addition to the public service award, considered the top prize, the news organization also won the breaking news photography award for its coverage.
The Times was awarded the international reporting prize for coverage that included daily reporting on the war as well as an eight-month investigation into the deaths of Ukrainians trying to flee from the town of Bucha that identified the Russian military unit responsible.
An Alabama news website, AL.com, received two Pulitzer Prizes. The organization was awarded the local news reporting prize for a series by John Archibald, Ashley Remkus, Ramsey Archibald and Challen Stephens that revealed how the police force in a town, Brookside, inflated its revenue by aggressively increasing traffic citations and vehicle seizures.
AL.com also won the commentary prize for columns by Kyle Whitmire, a political columnist whose examination of Alabama's Confederate history shows how it "still colors the present with racism and exclusion, told through tours of its first capital, its mansions and monuments -- and through the history that has been omitted," the Pulitzer board said in its announcement.
Another prize for local reporting was awarded to Anna Wolfe of Mississippi Today, for an investigation into a $ 77 million welfare scandal that revealed how former Mississippi governor, Phil Bryant, had steered funds to benefit family and friends, including the former N.F.L. quarterback Brett Favre.
The Los Angeles Times won the breaking news reporting prize for its coverage of a leaked audio recording of a secret conversation between Los Angeles City Council members in which the officials mocked people in racist terms and disparaged other council members. The uproar prompted the resignations of two of the leaders involved: Nury Martinez, the City Council president, and Ron Herrera, the president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.
The Los Angeles Times also won in the feature photography category. The photojournalist Christina House was awarded the prize for her images of a pregnant 22-year-old woman living in a tent on the streets of Hollywood and trying to navigate her situation.
The national reporting award went to Caroline Kitchener of The Washington Post for coverage of the unfolding consequences of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, including the story of a Texas teenager who discovered she was pregnant with twins 48 hours before the state's abortion ban went into effect.
The Washington Post also received the feature reporting prize, for work by Eli Saslow that portrayed the struggles of people across America, including those confronting homelessness and addiction or adapting to life after the pandemic. Mr. Saslow, a previous Pulitzer winner, has been a finalist for the feature writing category three times. He joined The New York Times as a writer at large in February.
A book by two Washington Post reporters was awarded the general nonfiction prize. "His Name Is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice," by Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa, explores the life of Mr. Floyd, whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020 ignited mass protests. Mr. Samuels left The Post this year and joined The New Yorker in March.
The investigative reporting prize was awarded to the staff of The Wall Street Journal for a series examining the financial investments of senior federal officials. The reporting team analyzed financial disclosures for about 12,000 officials, finding that thousands of them traded stock in companies that lobbied their agencies while more than 60 officials had disclosed trading stocks in companies shortly before regulatory actions were announced.
Caitlin Dickerson of The Atlantic was given the prize for explanatory reporting for her sprawling 30,000-word investigation into the Trump administration's family separation policy. Ms. Dickerson spent 18 months on the project, which revealed that U.S. officials had misled Congress and the public and often worked to keep migrant families apart longer.
The prize for criticism went to Andrea Long Chu, a critic at New York Magazine, for book reviews that examined both the works and their authors through multiple cultural lenses.
Nancy Ancrum, Amy Driscoll, Luisa Yanez, Isadora Rangel and Lauren Costantino of the Miami Herald were awarded the prize for editorial writing for the "Broken Promises" series that showed how Florida leaders had failed to deliver on vows to improve communities.
The audio reporting prize was awarded to the staff of Gimlet Media, notably Connie Walker, for the podcast "Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's." Ms. Walker investigated her late father's life and his experience and that of hundreds of other Indigenous children in Canada's residential school system.
Two books were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction: "Demon Copperhead," by Barbara Kingsolver, and "Trust," by Hernan Diaz. "Freedom's Dominion: A Saga of White Resistance to Federal Power," by Jefferson Cowie, received the award for history, and "G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century," by Beverly Gage, received the biography prize.
"Stay True," by Hua Hsu, was awarded the prize for memoir, and "Then the War: And Selected Poems, 2007-2020," by Carl Phillips, won for poetry.
"English," a play by Sanaz Toossi, won the Drama prize. It follows four students learning English as a second language in Iran, each with a different reason for enrolling in the class.
The Pulitzer Prize in Music was awarded to "Omar," an opera by Rhiannon Giddens and Michael Abels. The work premiered on May 27, 2022, at the Spoleto Festival USA. It is based on an autobiography of Omar Ibn Said, a Muslim man captured in Africa and sold into slavery in Charleston, S.C., in the early 1800s.

It’s no surprise that the shortage of primary care doctors — who are critically important to the health of Americans — is getting worse.
They practice in one of medicine’s lowest paid, least glamorous fields. Most are overworked, seeing as many as 30 people a day; figuring out when a sore throat is a strep infection, or managing a patient’s chronic diabetes.
So why are multibillion-dollar corporations, particularly giant health insurers, gobbling up primary care practices? CVS Health, with its sprawling pharmacy business and ownership of major insurer Aetna, paid roughly $11 billion to buy Oak Street Health, a fast-growing chain of primary care centers that employs doctors in 21 states. Amazon’s bold purchase of One Medical, another large doctors’ group, for nearly $4 billion, is another such move.
The appeal is simple: Despite their lowly status, primary care doctors oversee vast numbers of patients, who bring business and profits to a hospital system, a health insurer or a pharmacy outfit eyeing expansion.
And there’s an added lure: The growing privatization of Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, means that more than half its 60 million beneficiaries have signed up for policies with private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program. The federal government is paying those insurers $400 billion a year.
“That’s the big pot of money everyone is aiming at,” said Erin C. Fuse Brown, director of the Center for Law, Health & Society at Georgia State University, and an author of a New England Journal of Medicine article about corporate investment in primary care. “It’s a one-stop shop for all your health care dollars,” she said.
Many doctors say they are becoming mere employees. “We’ve seen this loss of autonomy,” said Dr. Dan Moore, who recently decided to start his own practice in Henrico, Virginia, to have more say in caring for his patients. “You don’t become a physician to spend an average of seven minutes with a patient,” he said.
The absorption of doctor practices is part of a vast, accelerating consolidation of medical care, leaving patients in the hands of a shrinking number of giant companies or hospital groups. Many already were the patients’ insurers and controlled the distribution of medicines through ownership of drugstore chains or pharmacy benefit managers. But now, nearly 7 of 10 of all doctors are either employed by a hospital or a corporation, according to a recent analysis from the Physicians Advocacy Institute.
The companies say these new arrangements will bring better, more coordinated care for patients, but some experts warn the consolidation will lead to higher prices and systems driven by the quest for profits, not patients’ welfare.
Insurers say their purchase of medical practices is a step toward what is called value-based care, with the insurer and doctor paid a flat fee to care for an individual patient. The fixed payment acts as a financial incentive to keep patients healthy, provide more access to early care and reduce hospital admissions and expensive visits to specialists.
The companies say they favor the fixed fees over the existing system that pays doctors and hospitals for every test and treatment, encouraging doctors to order too many procedures.
Under Medicare Advantage, doctors often share profits with insurers if the doctors take on the financial risk of a patient’s care, earning more if they can save on treatment. Instead of receiving a few hundred dollars for an office visit, primary care doctors can be paid as much as $14,000 a year to manage a single patient.
But experts warn these major acquisitions threaten the personal nature of the doctor-patient relationship, especially if the parent company has the authority to dictate limits on services from the first office visit to extended hospital stays. Once enrolled, these new customers can be steered toward chains of related businesses, like a CVS drugstore or Amazon’s online pharmacy.
UnitedHealth Group is a sprawling example of consolidated services. It owns the major insurer that has nearly 50 million customers in the United States and oversees its ever-expanding subsidiary, Optum, which has bought up networks of doctors and medical sites. Optum can send patients from one of its roughly 70,000 doctors to one of its urgent care or surgery centers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is urging the Federal Trade Commission to take a closer look at some of these large deals, which regulators have so far not blocked on antitrust grounds. “I fear that the acquisition of thousands of independent providers by a few massive health care mega-conglomerates could reduce competition on a local or national basis, hurting patients and increasing health care costs,” she wrote to regulators in March.
This consolidation of medical care may also run afoul of state laws that prohibit what is called corporate medicine. Such statutes prevent a company that employs doctors from interfering with patient treatment.
And experts warn of the potential harm to patients, when corporate management seeks to control costs through byzantine systems requiring prior authorization to receive care.
For example, Kaiser Permanente, the giant nonprofit health plan that also owns physician groups, settled a malpractice case for nearly $2.9 million last year with the family of Ken Flach, a former tennis player who contracted pneumonia and died from sepsis after a Kaiser nurse and doctor would not send him for an in-person visit or to the emergency room, despite the urgent pleading of his wife. Kaiser said medical decisions are made by its providers in consultation with their patients and said its “deepest sympathy remains with the Flach family.”
Doctors also chafe at oversight that does not benefit patients. “They are trying to run it like a business, but it’s not a business,” said Dr. Beth Kozak, an internal medicine doctor in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Her doctors’ group has teamed up with Agilon Health, an investor-owned company, to work with Medicare Advantage plans. Kozak said she has to work longer hours, not to provide better care, but to supply additional diagnoses for patients, which increases federal reimbursements under the Medicare Advantage program. “It’s not because I’m giving better patient care,” she said. “It’s all tied to the billing.”
The corporate consumption of medical care keeps growing. Walgreens Boots Alliance, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy operations, spent $5 billion for a majority stake in VillageMD, a primary care group, and teamed with Cigna to buy another medical group for nearly $9 billion. And short of an outright purchase, UnitedHealth is partnering with Walmart to offer care to older patients.
In promoting the benefits of buying Oak Street clinics to investors, Karen S. Lynch, the CEO of CVS Health, said primary care doctors lower medical costs. “Primary care drives patient engagement and positive clinical outcomes,” she said.
Many of these companies are building chains of clinics. On a recent tour of an Oak Street clinic in Bushwick, one of 16 centers opened since October 2020 in New York City, patients were typically seen from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a nurse available after hours to field questions.
Ann Greiner, the CEO of the Primary Care Collaborative, a nonprofit group, defended the recent forays by private companies into this field of health care, saying they are infusing practices with sorely needed funds and may improve access to care for people in underserved areas.
“The salaries of the folks in those arrangements are higher,” she said. “They are providing more comprehensive care in many of those arrangements. They are providing more tech and more team-based care. That’s all investment.”
But these deals also risk shifting the balance from quality treatment to profits, she said.
In recent years, some have invoked the laws banning corporate medicine to challenge these large-scale private operations. Envision Healthcare, a private equity-backed company that employs emergency room doctors, is being sued in California by a unit of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, a professional group that supports independent practices, accusing it of violating that state’s provisions.
“Envision exercises profound and pervasive direct and indirect control and/or influence over physicians practice of medicine, ” according to the lawsuit. The suit maintains that Envision controls the doctors’ billing and establishes medical protocols.
While Envision would not comment on the litigation, it said it “follows an operating structure that is common across the health care sector and widely used by nonprofit, privately held and public groups as well as hospitals and insurers.”
The big insurers find doctors’ groups particularly attractive, although many have reported sizable losses. The acquisition of Oak Street, which has lost more than $1 billion over the last three years, could help CVS’s Medicare Advantage plans improve their quality or “star” ratings and increase payments for one of its plans.
Even small numbers of patients can translate into significant revenue. One Medical, the company Amazon owns, is best known for sleek clinics. The company scooped up a practice specializing in Medicare Advantage. Only about 5% of One Medical’s 836,000 members are enrolled in that federal program, but roughly half of its revenue comes from that tiny slice of patients, according to its 2022 financial statements.
Regulators are already flagging questionable methods employed by some practices. In November 2021, Oak Street disclosed that the Justice Department was investigating sales ploys like free trips to its clinics and payment of insurance agents for referrals. One doctor at a center described recruiting patients with “gift cards, swag and goody bags,” according to a shareholder lawsuit against Oak Street.
The lawsuit detailed concerns that doctors were inflating the payments from the federal government by overstating how sick their patients were.
Oak Street says it has not been accused of any wrongdoing by the Justice Department and says the lawsuit is “without merit.”
These private Medicare Advantage plans have been heavily criticized for racking up enormous profits by inflating costs and exaggerating patients’ illnesses to charge the government more than they should.
Under new rules, the Biden administration would eliminate some of the most problematic, overused diagnoses, and doctors and insurers could earn less.
But other pathways to profit also explain why corporations covet these deals. Unlike the caps on insurers’ moneymaking, where a Medicare Advantage insurer has to spend at least 85 cents of every dollar on patient care, there are no limits to how much profit these doctor practices and pharmacy chains can make.
It may be too soon to determine whether consolidated care will improve patients’ health. “So far, when you look across the industry, the record of these acquisitions has been mixed,” said Dr. Sachin H. Jain, the CEO of SCAN Group, a nonprofit based in Long Beach, California, that offers Medicare Advantage plans.
And the investments may not halt the rapid disappearance of the doctor still sought by so many people for ordinary care, including a recent report showing fewer medical school graduates going into the field.
“We’re dealing with incredible levels of burnout within the profession,” said Dr. Max Cohen, who practices near Portland, Oregon. Since the pandemic, his low-income patients have become much sicker, he said, with the level of illness “through the roof.”

An Unwieldy Yet Incisive Play Revival: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Oscar Isaac and Rachel Brosnahan revisit Lorraine Hansberry's 1964 play on Broadway, following its sold-out run in Brooklyn.
Lorraine Hansberry didn't have the luxury of getting "The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window" right. In October 1964, days after the play opened on Broadway, a headline appeared in The New York Times: "Lorraine Hansberry Ill, Placed on Critical List."
She had been hospitalized before rehearsals started, but released in time to attend some of them. She saw previews; she attended opening night. Within two days, she was an inpatient again.
A week later, another article: "Revisions Are Made in 'Sidney Brustein,"' telling of "extensive script changes since its opening."
Then, on Jan. 13, 1965, a report of Hansberry's death the previous day, from cancer, at age 34. "She was unable to help fashion the last play as it took shape in rehearsals," the obituary read.
All of which surely helps to explain the unwieldiness of "The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window," a play that we might have looked back on as an early effort if only Hansberry had lived.
Revised further by her ex-husband and literary executor, Robert Nemiroff, after her death, it has returned to Broadway, at the James Earl Jones Theater, with Oscar Isaac in the title role of a bloviating, early '60s Greenwich Village intellectual. Rachel Brosnahan plays his wife, Iris, an actress manqué whose greatest feat of performance has been shaping herself into what he wants her to be.
The leads' considerable box-office appeal -- Isaac perhaps most widely known for his role in the "Star Wars" sequels, Brosnahan for playing the title character in the Amazon series "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" -- made Anne Kauffman's production a scorching-hot ticket earlier this year at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Rapidly transferring to Broadway, it opened last week on the final day of Tony Awards eligibility, while asking critics to stay away until this week. (I did not catch it in Brooklyn.)
Yet this seldom-seen play itself is a powerful draw. Clamorous with the voices of men, who take up an awful lot of oxygen, it is most incisive and piercing in the voices of its women, whom Hansberry draws with exquisite fullness. As a piece of theatrical and cultural history it is fascinating. And despite some sluggish moments, it does not feel overlong at two hours and 40 minutes, trimmed from three hours at BAM.
The script's unevenness does make you wonder, though, how Hansberry might have reworked it if she'd had the energy, and the privilege of time -- and to what degree she, a Black woman and closeted lesbian in the very white, very male, ostensibly straight world of midcentury American theater, felt pressure to conform in her playmaking.
Because really? Sidney Brustein, whom she has placed at the center of this crowded tragicomedy, is not an interesting person. This is not Isaac's fault, although he ignores Hansberry's stipulation that Sidney "laughs at himself as much as the world." Isaac's performance is mostly unremarkable but fine, sparking fully to life only in Sidney's scenes with Iris's wealthy, conventional sister, Mavis -- the best role in the show, and the best played, by a thoroughly captivating Miriam Silverman. (The play is a Tony nominee for best revival; Silverman is its only acting nominee.)
As written, Sidney is ridiculous, and stubbornly oblivious to that fact. Terrible at business, he has just bought a local newsweekly without mentioning it to Iris, because theirs is nowhere near a marriage of equals. The title nods to that: It's Sidney's window, not Iris's too, even though it is in their living room. (The set, framed by girders reaching up toward the sky, is a suitably impressive Broadway debut from the design collective dots, lately omnipresent Off Broadway.)
Sidney finds a smidgen of purpose when he agrees to back his politician friend Wally (Andy Grotelueschen), and puts a campaign sign in the window, advocating reform. Mostly, though, he is a man of thought, not action. Blusteringly self-important, he flails through life, naïve and directionless and pontificating nonetheless.
"I know it's hard for you, Iris, to understand what I'm all about," he says near the top of the show, but already the audience has his number. The line gets a giant laugh.
Iris, on the other hand, whom Sidney does not take seriously as an artist or an adult, knows exactly what her ambition is -- and it no longer involves pretending to embody his particular pastoral romantic fantasy. Iris, imbued by Brosnahan with a fragile strength and perfect comic timing, works as a waitress while scheming to break into the theater.
"I am 29," she says, "and I want to begin to know that when I die more than ten or a hundred people will know the difference. I want to make it, Sid."
In a Hansberry play, it pays to keep your eye on the women. "A Raisin in the Sun" is as much about the female characters as it is about Walter Lee Younger. Similarly, you could shift the kaleidoscope just a bit and see "Sidney Brustein" as being principally about Iris and her sisters, Mavis and Gloria (a terrific Gus Birney, all baby-voiced dignity) -- with a supporting role for young Alton (Julian De Niro), a rare Black character in this largely white play, who is in love with Gloria.
The matronly Mavis, everyday elegant in delectable period style (costumes are by Brenda Abbandandolo), is bigoted, complicated and startlingly wise about life. Gloria, a call girl who tells Alton that she's a model, is a sweet open wound. And Alton emerges as more injured and more furious than he'd let on.
There are other characters here -- David (Glenn Fitzgerald), a gay playwright neighbor, and Max (Raphael Nash Thompson), a painter-revolutionary -- and a swirl of social forces: racism, misogyny and homophobia among them. But the three sisters and Alton are the soul of "Sidney Brustein," the ones who make its ending land so potently. They exist inside a work that's crammed with people and ideas in the way that first plays often are, before writers learn to take their time.
Hansberry didn't have time. If she had, I like to think that she'd have cracked "Sidney Brustein" open and done some recycling, making more plays about Iris and her sisters and their friend.

Full text: Our critic recommends a grim new sci-fi series, a peak PBS show and a reality competition for cowboys.
This weekend I have ... an hour, and I like gray.
'Silo'
When to watch: Begins Friday, on Apple TV+.
Is it even the post-apocalypse if no one is wearing dingy knits? In premise and especially aesthetics, "Silo" resembles a lot of other sci-fi, with its whirring bleakness and rote authoritarianism, to which only the enlightened, rebellious -- sexy??? -- few object. The show is set in a grim future where just 10,000 people remain, and everyone lives deep underground, where, of course, their society still has a fair-minded wife-guy sheriff (David Oyelowo). If you miss the teen show "The 100," or if you listen to "Why We Build the Wall" from "Hadestown" on repeat, watch this.
... two hours, and I like explainers.
'The Articulate Hour'
When to watch: Friday at 9 and 10 p.m., on PBS. (Check local listings.)
Shows don't get much more PBS-y than this. "The Articulate Hour" interviews scientists, historians and artists to help explain concepts such as memory, time and togetherness. According to the show, "The desire to be in community with others lingers in our consciousness and is often given its purest voice in human creativity." "Articulate" weaves together hard science and poetic anecdotes into a reverent "Wow, check out humanity" series. If internet poisoning has left you a little alienated from the wonders of life and society, watch this.
... several hours, and I love competition shows.
'Ultimate Cowboy Showdown'
When to watch: Now, on Peacock or Amazon.
Three seasons of this rancher competition series are now streaming, finally giving viewers an opportunity to watch a man toss hay bales with so much ferocity that he barfs. (This is met with deep admiration.) As skill-based contest shows go, "Cowboy" is a treat: Horsemanship and cattle management skills are wildly telegenic and have not been standardized by reality-show packaging the way, say, cooking has. There's a happy freshness to that aspect of the series, even as the competitors behave in the ways "Top Model" has taught them to, arguing about respect and vacillating between proudly not making friends and, through tears, declaring that the real prize is the lifelong bonds everyone has formed.

Goldman Under Scrutiny In Bank Collapse Inquiry
U.S. authorities are investigating the work Goldman Sachs did for Silicon Valley Bank in the weeks before it failed, including its advice that the smaller lender sell a large portfolio of securities at a loss, according to a regulatory filing by Goldman on Thursday. Goldman said it was "cooperating with and providing information to various governmental bodies in connection with their investigations and inquiries" into Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed suddenly on March 10, touching off a crisis of confidence that has led to the failure of two more regional lenders, and a panic in the stock market over the fate of others. The investigations include "the firm's business with SVB in or around March 2023, when SVB engaged the firm to assist with a proposed capital raise and SVB sold the firm a portfolio of securities," Goldman's filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission said.

Paramount Global Seeks Sale of Simon & Schuster
Simon & Schuster is again up for sale. Months after a federal judge halted Penguin Random House's plan to buy its longtime rival, Simon & Schuster's chief executive and parent company, Paramount Global, have confirmed that the publisher is back on the market, with a sale possible by the end of the year. "I can now report that, as expected, Paramount has resumed the process of selling Simon & Schuster," Simon & Schuster's chief, Jonathan Karp, wrote in a staff memo. Karp noted in the letter that Simon & Schuster was enjoying a strong 2023 so far, with double-digit domestic revenue growth over the first three months compared with the same time period last year. Paramount has said that Simon & Schuster did not fit "strategically" because it is not videobased. Simon & Schuster, founded nearly a century ago, publishes such best-selling authors as Colleen Hoover, Stephen King and Bob Woodward. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Spotify Sells Deliverr And Cuts Work Force
Shopify, the e-commerce company viewed as a growing competitor to Amazon, is selling the two biggest pieces of its fulfillment network and abandoning its logistics ambitions. The company announced Thursday in a blog post it would also cut about 20 percent of its work force, the second mass layoff it has had in less than a year. Last year, Shopify trimmed 10 percent of its work force and reportedly laid off dozens of other employees before and after that announcement. Shopify also said in its earnings report that it pulled in $ 1.5 billion in revenue for the first quarter, which outperformed Wall Street's expectations. It reported a profit when analysts had been expecting a loss. Most of Shopify's fulfillment assets will be acquired by the logistics provider Flexport in an allstock deal that also includes the sale of the shipping service company Deliverr. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Those in picket lines at the headquarters of companies like Netflix were critical of working conditions that have become routine in the streaming era.
Ellen Stutzman, a senior Writers Guild of America official, stood on a battered patch of grass outside Netflix headquarters in Los Angeles. She was calm -- remarkably so, given the wild scene unfolding around her, and the role she had played in its creation.
"Hey, Netflix! You're no good! Pay your writers like you should!" hundreds of striking movie and television writers shouted in unison as they marched outside the Netflix complex. The spectacle had snarled traffic on Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday afternoon, and numerous drivers blared horns in support of a strike. Undulating picket signs, a few of which were covered with expletives, added to the sense of chaos, as did a hovering news helicopter and a barking dog. "Wow," a Netflix employee said as he inched his car out of the company's driveway, which was blocked by writers.
In February, unions representing 11,500 screenwriters selected Ms. Stutzman, 40, to be their chief negotiator in talks with studios and streaming services for a new contract. Negotiations broke off on Monday night, shortly before the contract expired. Ms. Stutzman and other union officials voted unanimously to call a strike, shattering 15 years of labor peace in Hollywood, and bringing the entertainment industry's creative assembly lines to a grinding halt.
"We told them there was a ton of pent-up anger," Ms. Stutzman said, referring to the companies at the bargaining table, which included Amazon and Apple. "They didn't seem to believe us."
The throng started a new chant, as if on cue. "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! This corporate greed has got to go!"
Similar scenes of solidarity unfolded across the entertainment capital. At Paramount Pictures, more than 400 writers -- and a few supportive actors, including Rob Lowe -- assembled to wave pickets with slogans like "Despicable You" and "Honk if you like words." Screenwriting titans like Damon Lindelof ("Watchmen," "Lost") and Jenny Lumet ("Rachel Getting Married," "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds") marched outside Amazon Studios. Acrimony hung in the air outside Walt Disney Studios, where one writer played drums on empty buckets next to a sign that read, "What we are asking for is a drop in the bucket."
Another sign goaded Mickey Mouse directly: "I smell a rat."
But the strike, at least in its opening hours, seemed to burn hottest at Netflix, with some writers describing the company as "the scene of the crime." That is because Netflix popularized and, in some cases, pioneered streaming-era practices that writers say have made their profession an unsustainable one -- a job that had always been unstable, dependent on audience tastes and the whims of revolving sets of network executives, has become much more so.
The streaming giant, for instance, has become known for "mini-rooms," which is slang for hiring small groups of writers to map out a season before any official greenlight has been given. Because it isn't a formal writers room, the pay is less. Writers in mini-rooms will sometimes work for as little as 10 weeks, and then have to scramble to find another job. (If the show is greenlit and goes into production, fewer writers are kept on board.)
"If you only get a 10-week job, which a lot of people now do, you really have to start looking for a new job on day one," said Alex Levy, who has written for Netflix shows like "Grace and Frankie." "In my case, I haven't been able to get a writing job for months. I've had to borrow money from my family to pay my rent."
Lawrence Dai, whose credits include "The Late Late Show with James Corden" and "American Born Chinese," a Disney+ series, echoed Ms. Levy's frustration. "It feels like an existential moment because it's becoming impossible to build a career," he said. "The dream is dead."
Studio executives have largely maintained public silence, instead leaving communication to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on their behalf. In statements, the organization has said its goal was a "mutually beneficial deal," which was "only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining" and "searching for reasonable compromises."
On Monday, when talks broke down, the organization said the companies had made an offer that included "generous increases in compensation for writers." The primary sticking points, it added, were union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, "whether needed or not."
Samantha Riley, whose credits include "Hacks" and "Fresh Off the Boat," started to breathe fire on the Netflix picket line when the conversation turned to the offer made by the companies. (The union made the proposals public.) "I'm offended by the offer," Ms. Riley said. "It's horrendous."
In particular, writers were irate about the manner in which studios responded to their concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of screenwriting. The W.G.A. wants studios to agree to protections that guarantee A.I. will not encroach on writers' credits and compensation. The studios rejected the proposal, instead suggesting an annual meeting on advances in technology.
"Radicalized might be too strong of a word, but the studios, by doing that, made people even more unified," said Tom Szentgyorgi, whose credits range from "The Mentalist" to "NYPD Blue."
First-day enthusiasm notwithstanding, writers will find it no small task in coming weeks to block a production apparatus that, in the Los Angeles area alone, is spread across more than 100 studio facilities, several hundred postproduction houses and numerous location shoots that move from day to day. Hollywood's most recent strike, in 2007, stretched for more than three months. The 2007 strike was in winter, when daytime temperatures in Los Angeles are in the 60s. The upcoming summer in Burbank, however, means 100 degree days, day after day.
Irene Turner, a veteran of the 2007 strike, was a bit weary after three hours of trudging in the sun outside Disney on Tuesday. But she was nowhere close to calling it quits. "This is super good for me because I sit on my butt on a laptop," she said.
Ms. Turner, whose credits include the 2017 Netflix film "The Most Hated Woman in America," called the strike "necessary and miserable," adding that "a lot of people will get hurt." The 2007 strike cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $ 2.1 billion, with small businesses supporting television and film production also crunched.
Kevin Yee, an actor ("Dickinson") turned screenwriter who was pumping his sign up and down furiously outside Warner Bros., said he was nervous about how long a strike could last.
"It felt like the producers wanted us to strike," Mr. Yee said. "They've stopped greenlighting a lot of things in anticipation of this. So there wasn't a lot for me to do anyways. With the current state of things, there is no hope for this industry unless they step up and they make this a sustainable career. So to me, I have nothing to lose."

Howard Trustees Pick Provost Of Case Western To Be President: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ben Vinson III, the provost of Case Western Reserve, will lead an institution that has surged, with record research grants and high-profile academic hires.
Howard University, the renowned historically Black institution that was founded to educate freed slaves, has selected a historian of Latin America as its next president, as the university's leaders hope to continue its trajectory of surging enrollment and research growth.
Ben Vinson III, who has served as provost of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland since 2018, was chosen to be the 18th president of Howard, a 156-year-old university in Washington, D.C., that counts Vice President Kamala Harris, the former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and the author Toni Morrison among its alumni. He will assume the post on Sept. 1.
The move, announced by the university on Tuesday, comes at an energized time for Howard, which has scored a series of wins in recent years, including record research expenditures and high-profile academic hires. Dr. Vinson will need to keep up the momentum, as well as deal with students who have staged sit-ins and protested conditions at the university.
"Dr. Vinson is the right leader to usher Howard into its next era," Leslie Hale, vice chair of the university's board of trustees, said in a statement. "As a historian, he reveres the Howard legacy and brings a bold perspective of where Howard University should sit within the upper echelon of academic institutions."
Some faculty members said his selection was a surprise, objecting to the search process. Dr. Marcus Alfred, an associate professor of physics and astronomy and chair of the faculty senate, said the university limited the faculty senate's participation. And he said that in a break from the past, the university community was not given the opportunity to meet with the finalists.
In the last few years, Howard University has appointed high-profile figures like Stacey Abrams, the politician and voting rights activist, and the journalists Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ta-Nehisi Coates to its faculty.
University leaders have said they hope the institution can become the first historically Black college to break into the select group of institutions with the highest research expenditures. In October, the university announced that it had raised $ 122 million in research grants and contracts, a record.
Last year, the university announced that it would spend $ 785 million to build three new academic halls and renovate other buildings, a move that officials at the time described as the product of "unprecedented financial strength."
Wayne A.I. Frederick, who said last year that he would step down as president of the university, called the facilities investment a "watershed moment." Officials described it at the time as the biggest real-estate investment in the university's history, driven partly by increased enrollment.
They also credited increased public and philanthropic investment. In 2020, the university announced that it had received a $ 40 million gift from MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon.
Even so, students have been impatient for change. In 2021, they held sit-ins and slept in tents to protest housing shortages and poor living conditions in the dorms, a concern common to many historically Black universities with aging buildings. After a standoff lasting more than a month, students reached an agreement with Howard and ended the protest.
Dr. Vinson's academic field makes a sharp contrast with that of Dr. Frederick, the outgoing president, who is a Howard-trained surgeon. The university search committee and trustees turned next to a historian, with his focus cast outside of the United States.
Dr. Vinson is a scholar of the African diaspora with an eye especially on colonial Latin America. He is the author of several books, including "Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico."
Dr. Vinson, 52, spent his childhood on military bases in Italy, where his father was a master sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. He has previously served as the founding director of the Center for Africana Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he also taught history, and as dean of George Washington University's liberal arts and sciences college.
The chairman of the Howard board of trustees, Laurence C. Morse, said in a news release that Dr. Vinson had "demonstrated his commitment to elevating the diversity of experiences of people of the African diaspora -- a commitment that aligns well with Howard University's mission and vision."Mr. Morse did not respond to an interview request.
In a statement, the president of Case Western Reserve, Eric W. Kaler, credited Dr. Vinson with leading development of that university's ambitious strategic plan and new general education requirements, and with increasing diversity in its faculty and graduate student recruitment. President Kaler also said that Dr. Vinson was a strong supporter of the humanities at a time when some universities were cutting back on them.
"He is an exceptionally warm and empathetic person and will be a great leader for Howard," he said.

McDonald's Groups FinedFor Child Labor Violations
Two 10-year-olds are among 300 children who worked at McDonald's restaurants illegally, a Labor Department investigation of franchisees in Kentucky found.
Agency investigators found the 10-year-olds received little or no pay at a McDonald's in Louisville, the Labor Department said. The three franchisees were fined $ 212,000 in total.
One of them, Louisville's Bauer Food L.L.C., which operates 10 McDonald's locations, employed 24 minors under the age of 16 to work more hours than legally permitted, the agency said. Among those were two 10-year-old children. The agency said the children sometimes worked as late as 2 a.m., but were not paid.
The franchise owner-operator, Sean Bauer, said the two 10-year-olds were visiting their parent, a night manager, and weren't employees.
The Walton, Ky.-based Archways Richwood L.L.C. and Louisville-based Bell Restaurant Group I L.L.C. were also fined. ASSOCIATED PRESS

French Authority RejectsRestoring Retirement Age
France's top constitutional body rejected on Wednesday an effort by opposition lawmakers to undo a law to raise the retirement age to 64, deeming that a proposal did not meet the needed criteria. The law was pushed by President Emmanuel Macron, right.
It was the second time that the Constitutional Council has rejected the plan to restore the retirement age to 62, notably via a possible referendum or new bill. Had it passed muster, the process called for would be long and wouldn't stop Mr. Macron's unpopular law from taking effect.
Opposition lawmakers, mainly from the left, sought a complex process to reject the law, which was enacted last month.
The Constitutional Council's role was to assess whether the opposition's request meets the legal conditions for a potential referendum. Had it been accepted, supporters would have had nine months to collect signatures from at least 4.8 million, or 10 percent, of French voters. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google Plans to Add2 Data Centers in Ohio
Google plans to build two more data centers in Ohio to help power its artificial intelligence technology and other tools, the company and state officials announced Wednesday.
With one data center already up and running near Columbus, the two new locations will bring Google's total investment in Ohio to more than $ 2 billion, officials said.
Ohio is seeing a wave of big investments by the technology industry.
Intel is building a $ 20 billion chip factory just east of Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea are building a $ 3.5 billion battery plant between Columbus and Cincinnati that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub.
The area around Columbus also is home to data centers operated by Facebook and Amazon.
The two new Google data centers will be built in Columbus and Lancaster. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Hollywood Writers Go on Strike, And Late-Night Shows Go Dark: [National Desk]

Full text: How long they stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, they gradually returned after a couple of months.
Just hours after the union representing thousands of television and movie writers announced that they were going on strike, hundreds of their members occupied an entire city block in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday.
Gathered outside an NBCUniversal event on Fifth Avenue, the writers chanted "No contract, no content" and held up signs with slogans like "Pencils Down!!!" and "Spoiler Alert: We Will Win."
"These companies are absolutely destroying our industry," Tony Kushner, the acclaimed playwright and a screenwriter of movies like "Lincoln" and "The Fabelmans," said from the picket line, referring to Hollywood studios.
It was a noisy show of solidarity, echoed on picket lines outside the major studios in Los Angeles. But the immediate fallout of the strike -- which shattered 15 years of labor peace in the entertainment industry and will bring much of Hollywood's production assembly line to a halt -- was felt most acutely in the world of late-night television, which immediately went dark.
On Tuesday afternoon, NBC issued a statement that the upcoming edition of the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" would be a repeat from April. "Late Night With Seth Meyers" canceled a show that was supposed to feature an interview with the actress Rachel Weisz, replacing it with a rerun from February.
New episodes from late-night shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have also been suspended. "Saturday Night Live" canceled a new episode scheduled for this weekend with Pete Davidson as host. NBC said it would "air repeats until further notice," raising the possibility that the show will not be able to end its 48th season with a finale.
How long late-night talk shows stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, in 2007, late-night shows gradually came back after about two months, even with their writers still on picket lines. (That strike lasted 100 days.)
Mr. Kimmel, ABC's late-night host, was paying his staff out of pocket during that strike, and he said years later that he had to return to air because he had nearly drained his life savings.
David Letterman, who owned his CBS late-night show through his production company Worldwide Pants, made a deal with the Writers Guild of America that allowed his writers to come back on the show.
The other hosts -- whose shows were owned by media companies -- had no such luck. Hosts like Mr. Kimmel and Conan O'Brien returned without their writers, and gamely tried to put together their shows without their standard monologues. Mr. O'Brien had to resort to time-killing gimmicks, such as spinning his wedding ring on his desk, setting a timer to it in the process.
Jay Leno, the host of "The Tonight Show," infuriated W.G.A. officials by writing his own monologue jokes. "A Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar," Mr. Leno said during his opening monologue, which stretched nearly 10 minutes. "The Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there's a writers' strike."
Late-night hosts and their top producers have been on group calls in recent weeks, coordinating a response in the event of a strike, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Unlike the enmity of the so-called late-night wars from the 1990s, the hosts have made a concerted effort to show that they are on friendly, if still competitive, terms. When James Corden signed off from "The Late Late Show" last week, there was a taped segment that featured Mr. Colbert, Mr. Fallon, Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Meyers all together.
Mr. Meyers, the host of NBC's 12:30 a.m. show, alluded to the devastation of the last strike in a segment late last week.
"It doesn't just affect the writers," Mr. Meyers said in the web-only video. "It affects all the incredible nonwriting staff on these shows."
He added that he was a proud member of the W.G.A., and that he felt strongly that what the writers were asking for was "not unreasonable."
"If you don't see me here next week, know that it is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you as well," he said.
The strike would have to stretch for a significantly longer time before viewers began to see the effects on scripted TV shows and movies, because the production process for them can take months or more than a year. But the mere fact that many productions suddenly stopped was a blow to an industry already rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The biggest issue for the writers is pay. They have said that their compensation has stagnated even as television production has rapidly grown over the past decade. The unions representing the writers, the East and West branches of the Writers Guild of America, said "the companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union work force, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing."
W.G.A. leaders have called this moment "existential," arguing that the "the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation."
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said in a statement shortly before the strike was announced that its offer included "generous increases in compensation for writers."
The primary sticking points, according to the studios, involve union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time "whether needed or not."
Chris Keyser, a chair of the W.G.A. negotiating committee, said in an interview early Tuesday morning that "philosophically, and practically, we're very far apart."
Over the last decade, a period that is often referred to as Peak TV, the number of scripted television shows broadcast in the United States has risen sharply. Writers, however, said that their pay has stagnated.
In the network television era, a writer could get work on a show with more than 20 episodes a season, providing a steady living for an entire year. However, in the streaming era, episode orders have declined to 8 or 12, and the median weekly pay for a writer-producer has gone down slightly, the W.G.A. said.
"They're making it impossible for younger writers to make a living," Mr. Kushner, the playwright and screenwriter, said. "Our wages have declined since the last strike."
The writers want to also fix the formula for residual payments, which have been upended by streaming. Years ago, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed -- into syndication or through DVD sales. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms and pay a fixed residual instead.
For now, the writers' creative energy will be solely dedicated to their picket signs. Outside the NBCUniversal event, one writer held up a sign that read, "Pay your writers or we'll spoil 'Succession."'

Full text: "Death of an Author" is a murder mystery coaxed from artificial-intelligence tools like ChatGPT.
DEATH OF AN AUTHOR, by Aidan Marchine
Siri, what was the novel?
"Since you asked, it was the subtlest form of expression known to humans. The first novel was probably Murasaki Shikibu's 'Tale of Genji,' written in the 11th century. The last one that mattered, closing a millennium's loop, was probably Zadie Smith's 'White Teeth,' published in 2000. What's come since has been the death rattle, and remixes of that death rattle."
Those weren't, you might have guessed, words from Siri. That was your human correspondent, writing on a laptop in a drafty apartment in Manhattan and advancing an argument that's been plausibly made for centuries: that literature es muerte.
The obituaries go back a long time. Samuel Richardson, in the 18th century, wondered if the novel had said what it had to say. Theodore Adorno argued that writing poetry after Auschwitz was barbaric. Jorge Luis Borges made a decisive career out of recognizing, in his ficciones, the near impossibility of making original works of literature.
The fire has been stirred under these questions thanks to the sudden arrival of sophisticated artificial intelligence chatbots, notably ChatGPT. It provides autofill, or something like it, on an uncanny level. ChatGPT has given many authors a case of the dreads. Its presence has crawled like a tumor through the spine of their other abiding freakouts. Go hug a writer.
Now comes a new novella, "Death of an Author," a murder mystery published under the pseudonym Aidan Marchine. It's the work of the novelist and journalist Stephen Marche, who coaxed the story from three programs, ChatGPT, Sudowrite and Cohere, using a variety of prompts. The book's language, he says, is 95 percent machine-generated, somewhat like the food at a Ruby Tuesday.
Well, somebody was going to do it. In truth, other hustlers out there on Amazon already have. But "Death of an Author" is arguably the first halfway readable A.I. novel, an early glimpse at what is vectoring toward readers. It has been presided over by a literate writer who has pushed the borg in twisty directions. He got it to spit out more than boilerplate, some of the time. If you squint, you can convince yourself you're reading a real novel.
Scary? Maybe. A big deal? When Jonathan Schell's anti-nuke manifesto "The Fate of the Earth" was published in 1982, the critic Eliot Fremont-Smith wrote that Knopf should cancel the rest of its spring list in deference to it. Let's not clear the calendar for "Death of an Author."
The book has metafictional zest. It's about a well-known Canadian writer named Peggy Firmin, who vaguely resembles Margaret Atwood. She is collaborating on an all-encompassing A.I. project with a hoodie-wearing billionaire who once dated Meghan Markle. His name is Neil Gibson, in homage, one assumes, to the cyberpunk writers Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, even though he's a lout and, to the best of my knowledge, Stephenson and Gibson are not.
After Firmin is shot and killed on a deserted bridge, shocking the literary world, a small group of people are invited to her funeral. Firmin, in the form of an avatar tanked up on the latest A.I., delivers her own eulogy. It's the sort of eulogy that, in Agatha Christie fashion, makes everyone's skin prickle, and makes them wonder if the killer is in the room.
A detective, in the form of a Firmin scholar, is beavering around. The A.I. program Firmin and Gibson were working on begins impersonating the suspects. Who is real? Is Firmin seeking revenge from beyond the grave? Is the scholar being framed? Is someone out to kill him? What does it mean to be an "author" anyway? And so on.
I am not a big reader of mysteries, and I rarely care who's done it. "Death of an Author" is clever, for sure, but it left me feeling hollow, as if I'd made a meal out of red herrings. The prose mostly has the crabwise gait of a Wikipedia entry. If this novel could exhale, its breath would surely smell, to borrow words from Ian McEwan in his novel "Machines Like Me," like the back of a warm TV set.
What's interesting are the moments when you sense Marche pushing the A.I., like Wendy Carlos bent over her Moog synthesizer, or a kid rocking a pinball machine, to go deeper. Firmin predicts, for example, where we might be in a few years with this technology:
We'll also see stories created specifically for individuals inside their experience, the ability to recreate dead relatives through A.I. technology. Stories where the audience doesn't even know they're stories. Characters who are felt so deeply that they aren't characters at all, but you become the character. It's going to be a gorgeous mess.
Gorgeous might not be the word I'd choose.
It's hard to tell when you're reading Marche and when you're reading A.I., but it's good to know there might still be humor, of a sort, in the spell-checked world of our digital-language overlords. There's a crack about the awfulness of the metaverse, and a letter has the sexy sign-off "Desiring your algorithm."
The figurative language is hit-and-mostly-miss. ("The smell of coffee was like a fog burning off a field.") Bots must get lonely too. This book declares, against all dictates of sense, that "even the most delicious cake is unpleasant eaten alone."
Marche convincingly makes the case, in an afterword, that writers will manipulate A.I. the way that hip-hop producers dig up and arrange samples. Those with the best taste, and the most knowledge, will make the best stuff, some with a genius all its own.
I was making mischief, of course, when I declared that the novel is dead, although if I were backed into a corner, or thrust onto the stage at a debating union, I could probably muster a defense of "White Teeth" as a kind of capstone.
Fiction matters more now, in a world increasingly deracinated by technology. A.I. will never pose a threat to the real thing -- to writing with convictions, honest doubts, riddling wit, a personal vision of the world, rawness and originality. Another word for these qualities is soul, which is exactly what ChatGPT lacks. Left wholly naked in front of the A.I. onslaught may be the writers of certain formulaic best sellers, but that's a matter for their agents.
There are intelligent people out there who want to hit "pause" on the development of artificial intelligence, to pull the cord out of the wall for a while. About this I'm ambivalent.
But late at night, when I'm fighting my own dreads and conjuring worst-case A.I. scenarios for the planet, I sometimes think of a line that J.M. Coetzee attributed to Mark Twain and paraphrased this way: "When an American writer does not know how to end a story, he shoots everyone in sight."

Writers Go on Strike and Late Shows Go Dark

Just hours after the union representing thousands of television and movie writers announced that it was going on strike, hundreds of its members occupied an entire city block in New York on Tuesday.
Gathered outside an NBCUniversal event on Fifth Avenue, the writers chanted “No contract, no content” and held up signs with slogans like “Pencils Down!!!” and “Spoiler Alert: We Will Win.”
“These companies are absolutely destroying our industry,” Tony Kushner, an acclaimed playwright and a screenwriter of movies like “Lincoln” and “The Fabelmans,” said from the picket line, referring to Hollywood studios.
It was a noisy show of solidarity, echoed on picket lines outside the major studios in Los Angeles. But the immediate fallout of the strike — which shattered 15 years of labor peace in the entertainment industry and will bring much of Hollywood’s production assembly line to a halt — was felt most acutely in the world of late-night television, which immediately went dark.
On Tuesday afternoon, NBC issued a statement that the upcoming edition of the “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” would be a repeat from April. “Late Night With Seth Meyers” canceled a show that was supposed to feature an interview with actor Rachel Weisz, replacing it with a rerun from February.
New episodes from late-night shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have also been suspended. “Saturday Night Live” canceled a new episode scheduled for this weekend with Pete Davidson as host. NBC said it would “air repeats until further notice,” raising the possibility that the show will not be able to end its 48th season with a finale.
How long late-night talk shows stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, in 2007, late-night shows gradually came back after about two months, even with their writers still on picket lines. (That strike lasted 100 days.)
Kimmel, ABC’s late-night host, was paying his staff out of pocket during that strike, and he said years later that he had to return to air because he had nearly drained his life savings.
David Letterman, who owned his CBS late-night show through his production company Worldwide Pants, made a deal with the Writers Guild of America that allowed his writers to come back on the show.
The other hosts — whose shows were owned by media companies — had no such luck. Hosts like Kimmel and Conan O’Brien returned without their writers, and gamely tried to put together their shows without their standard monologues. O’Brien had to resort to time-killing gimmicks, such as spinning his wedding ring on his desk, setting a timer to it in the process.
Jay Leno, the host of “The Tonight Show,” infuriated Writers Guild of America officials by writing his own monologue jokes. “A Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar,” Leno said during his opening monologue, which stretched nearly 10 minutes. “The Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there’s a writers strike.”
Late-night hosts and their top producers have been on group calls in recent weeks, coordinating a response in the event of a strike, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Unlike the enmity of the so-called late-night wars from the 1990s, the hosts have made a concerted effort to show that they are on friendly, if still competitive, terms. When James Corden signed off from “The Late Late Show” last week, there was a taped segment that featured Colbert, Fallon, Kimmel and Meyers all together.
Meyers, the host of NBC’s 12:30 a.m. show, alluded to the devastation of the last strike in a segment late last week.
“It doesn’t just affect the writers,” Meyers said in the web-only video. “It affects all the incredible nonwriting staff on these shows.”
He added that he was a proud member of the Writers Guild of America, and that he felt strongly that what the writers were asking for was “not unreasonable.”
“If you don’t see me here next week, know that it is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you as well,” he said.
The strike would have to stretch for a significantly longer time before viewers began to see the effects on scripted TV shows and movies, because the production process for them can take months or more than a year. But the mere fact that many productions suddenly stopped was a blow to an industry already rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The biggest issue for the writers is pay. They have said that their compensation has stagnated even as television production has rapidly grown over the past decade. The unions representing the writers, the East and West branches of the Writers Guild of America, said “the companies’ behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing.”
Writers Guild of America leaders have called this moment “existential,” arguing that the “the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation.”
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said in a statement shortly before the strike was announced that its offer included “generous increases in compensation for writers.”
The primary sticking points, according to the studios, involve union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time “whether needed or not.”
Chris Keyser, a chair of the Writers Guild of America negotiating committee, said in an interview early Tuesday that “philosophically, and practically, we’re very far apart.”
Over the past decade, a period that is often referred to as Peak TV, the number of scripted television shows broadcast in the United States has risen sharply. Writers, however, said that their pay has stagnated.
In the network television era, a writer could get work on a show with more than 20 episodes a season, providing a steady living for an entire year. However, in the streaming era, episode orders have declined to eight or 12, and the median weekly pay for a writer-producer has gone down slightly, the Writers Guild of America said.
“They’re making it impossible for younger writers to make a living,” Kushner said. “Our wages have declined since the last strike.”
The writers want to also fix the formula for residual payments, which have been upended by streaming. Years ago, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed — into syndication or through DVD sales. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms and pay a fixed residual instead.
For now, the writers’ creative energy will be solely dedicated to their picket signs. Outside the NBCUniversal event, one writer held up a sign that read, “Pay your writers or we’ll spoil ‘Succession.’”

DEATH OF AN AUTHOR, by Aidan Marchine

Full text: Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent in the Washington bureau. When he's not sharing reporting with his teammates in morning pitch meetings, he's making TV and movie recommendations. Here are five things he's heard, read or watched.
Succession
This show makes you care so deeply about characters who are so cruel, thanks to fantastic writing and acting. The final season has already included one of the most shocking twists yet, but has also given peripheral characters surprising time in the spotlight. I'll miss it when it's over.
Air
It is not just a Nike commercial. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's reunion is a rare throwback: a film showing people talking about ideas. If you're not intrigued by a story about the men who effectively changed the culture of professional basketball, watch it for Viola Davis as a mother determined for her son to reach his potential.
Leave the World Behind
A white family rents a Long Island house to escape New York City, but when something disastrous happens back home, they are surprised when a Black couple, ostensibly the owners, shows up. Would you welcome strangers in a disaster? Answering that may force readers of Rumaan Alam's novel to confront their own biases.
Love, Damini
I just returned from a reporting trip in West Africa, and I will be starting my mornings with Burna Boy and this album for the foreseeable future. It's hard to not feel like celebrating when you have Afrobeats on. If you hear "It's Plenty" playing at full volume in Washington, D.C., you were warned here of who might be the culprit.
Cupid Deluxe
It's spring, and I'm back on my Brooklyn rooftop with friends. At least that's how I feel every time I play this 2013 classic from one of my favorite artists: Devonté Hynes, who performs as Blood Orange. His music doesn't fit into a specific genre, but each song on this album evokes memories of vibing and maybe dancing (likely off beat) at a kickback.

Full text: As nonprofit workers unionize, negotiations can make things awkward in mission-based workplaces.
All they saw were red lines. And that meant "no deal." Yet.
The newly unionized employees at Community Solutions, a nonprofit based in New York City that combats homelessness, were in the early days of negotiating their first contract. They had assumed that their proposal to protect formerly homeless people from being discriminated against in the organization's hiring process would be a simple matter for both sides.
Instead, hammering out the clause has turned into months of disagreements and returned proposals, slashed through with red ink. Management has legal concerns over the language used, while staff members are focused on the very people for whom their workplace finds housing. "We all agree on principle," said Paulette Martin, the chief operating officer.
But so far, that is where the understanding ends.
As workers at private companies like Starbucks and Amazon start to organize across the country, so too are nonprofit employees, from adjunct professors to environmental activists. Yet inside mission-based organizations, union negotiations can be particularly awkward.
"In the social justice, pro-change, progressive movement, the leaders and the staff are often aligned," said Amy Smoucha, a consultant. "But unionization can be a blunt instrument, and it can be difficult, even for the most well-intentioned nonprofit, to find a collaborative path."
At Community Solutions, the tensions began after the group was awarded a $ 100 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation. "We went from a smaller organization to one that was a lot bigger," said John Collier, a data analyst at the nonprofit, as well as a union organizer, "and we wanted to have a seat at the table, for the people who were actually doing the work to have a voice."
Mr. Collier, along with all but one of his colleagues, voted to join Office and Professional Employees International Local 153 last year. When they informed management of their decision, workers said they were surprised when Community Solutions hired a powerful law firm, Proskauer, to negotiate a contract. (The firm is also representing The New York Times in current contract negotiations with the The New York Times Guild.)
When the employees' proposed nondiscrimination clause was rejected, nearly every word cut, it became a turning point for them, said Sandy Colts, a systems improvement adviser at Community Solutions and one of the original members of the organizing committee. "This was a value statement, based on our lived experiences," he said. "They should trust that we are requesting these protections for a reason."
Community Solutions maintains that they support the idea behind the proposal and are only concerned with the wording. "We believe that our shared commitment to addressing harassment or discrimination of any kind is reflected in what we put forward," Ms. Martin said in a statement. The clause that management would like to use, she continued, "includes strong anti-discrimination language that is nearly identical to other collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the same union."
Recently, labor unions have experienced a resurgence, with approval numbers at the highest point since 1965, according to Gallup. The office union has 11,000 members locally, and added 800 new workers last year, compared with less than 100 new members in 2018. In that same period, the Nonprofit Professionals Employees Union expanded to 1,700 members, from 300 four years prior.
"Workers, organizers, rank and file staff in nonprofits are trying to interrupt this 'martyrdom' syndrome, that by doing this work, your job is grueling, you work long hours and you are paid very little," said Kevin Simowitz, the co-director of All Due Respect, which works to set new labor standards for community organizers.
In addition to improving salaries and benefits, other concerns cited by organizers include transparency, standardized pay scales and racial equity.
For nonprofit managers, the prospect of a union can be disconcerting. Many organizations try to maintain a close knit, collaborative environment where leadership and staff bond over a shared public service goal. When workers unionize, it can put leadership on the defensive, some experts say.
But Alethia Jones, a distinguished lecturer in labor studies at City University of New York, does not believe it has to be this way. "Unions aren't just about the cost point, they can lead to better relationships and more stability," she said.
Ms. Smoucha suggested that nonprofits should start with voluntarily recognizing employee unions. "They are going to have a union anyway," she said. "Labor laws provide workers with limited rights, but one that is assured is the right to form a union and choose collective bargaining."
VOCAL-NY, a social change organization that runs a syringe exchange program, voluntarily recognized its staff union last year. "We need to get it out of our heads that when staff want to unionize, it is a sign that we aren't good employers, that we've done something wrong," said Jeremy Saunders, the co-executive director.
At INCLUDEnyc, a nonprofit that provides training, resources, and referrals for families with students with disabilities and the professionals who serve them, staff members began organizing in March 2021.
Maggie Downham, a family educator at the organization, was discussing work issues with her therapist, who suggested that she and her colleagues start a union. "I started talking to my co-workers and it wasn't just me who felt this way, and informal conversations turned into organizing," she said.
But once the union was formed, contract negotiations stalled. Employees started collective actions like using union logos as their backgrounds and emailing management and board members employee testimonies. In mid-March, terms for a contract were finally agreed upon.
"We underscore our commitment to equity," said Cheryelle Cruickshank, its executive director, in a statement about the deal. "We have achieved a mutually agreed verbal agreement that is fair and equitable for all parties."
Money can be difficult to access at nonprofits, which rely on individual donations and institutional grants, many of which come with time limits and other constraints. "There is a scarcity mentality, and even a scarcity reality, to contend with," said Alicia Jay, the co-director of All Due Respect, referring to nonprofit budgets, which can look quite different from those of large corporations. "It isn't a bottomless well, like with private companies such as Amazon."
Often, funds will be earmarked for a specific program, but do not always include the administrative costs associated with running it, Dr. Jones said. "No one wants to fund the electric bill, or the holiday party."
MacKenzie Scott, the novelist and philanthropist, has shown a way forward, perhaps, by giving away billions in unrestricted grants. This method gives organizations the authority to specify where and how they want to spend their money.
Still, nonprofit union organizing is in its early stages. "There is a model mismatch between the way unions typically organize in for-profit settings, and how they can do it differently among nonprofits," Ms. Smoucha said. "It is a big growing pain, but it's imperative we figure out how to do it better."

New Lyft C.E.O. Lays Out Vision and Tells Workers to Return to the Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A day after nearly 1,100 people were laid off, the struggling company told its remaining workers to prepare for a series of changes.
Since the pandemic began, Lyft employees have been able to work remotely, logging into videoconferences from their homes and dispersing across the country like many other tech workers. Last year, the company made that policy official, telling staff that work would be "fully flexible" and subleasing floors of its offices in San Francisco and elsewhere.
No longer. On Friday, David Risher, the company's new chief executive, told employees in an all-hands meeting that they would be required to come back into the office at least three days a week, starting this fall. It was one of the first major changes he has made at the struggling ride-hailing company since starting this month, and it came just a day after he laid off 26 percent of Lyft's work force.
"Things just move faster when you're face to face," Mr. Risher said in an interview. Remote work in the tech industry, he said, had come at a cost, leading to isolation and eroding culture. "There's a real feeling of satisfaction that comes from working together at a whiteboard on a problem."
The decision, combined with the layoffs and other changes, signals the beginning of a new chapter at Lyft. It could also be an indication that some tech companies -- particularly firms that are struggling -- may be changing their minds on flexibility about where employees work. Nudges toward working in the office could soon turn into demands, as they have at companies like Disney and Apple.
Bob Sutton, an organizational psychologist and a professor at Stanford, said that although in-person collaboration could help with creativity and some other parts of work, companies pushing for a return to office might be doing so to have greater oversight of their workers.
"When top executives feel financial stress, the classic 'threat-rigidity' effect kicks in, and beyond possible benefits for communication, collaboration and creativity, they feel compelled to increase their own illusion of control," Mr. Sutton said.
After lagging behind its rival, Uber, in the race to emerge from the pandemic doldrums, Lyft posted worrisome financial results in February. Its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, said the next month that they would step down.
Mr. Risher, a veteran of Microsoft and Amazon who also served on Lyft's board of directors, has laid out a plan to streamline the business, cut costs and focus on improving the quality and lowering the price of Lyft's core product: rides for customers.
Lyft employees have complained that divisions outside the ride-hailing business, like units that offer rental cars to its gig drivers and rent bikes and scooters to consumers, seemed to be disproportionately affected by the layoffs. Mr. Risher said the cuts were across the board.
He said the cost savings from the layoffs would go toward lower prices for riders and higher earnings for drivers.
The next phase of his plan, he said, is to remind riders that Lyft is a viable alternative to Uber. In the summer, Mr. Risher said, he will gradually introduce products to increase interest in the platform. That may include teaming up with companies to offer Lyft rides to their employees who are commuting to offices, he said.
The next steps for the company will be difficult. Many Lyft employees have gotten used to working from home, and some were already bristling at the possibility of returning to the office. Lyft continues to trail Uber, which has a global ride-hailing business and also offers food delivery.
Lyft's stock price is trading at $ 10 a share, down from $ 78 at its peak, and some have speculated that it could be an acquisition target. The company will report financial results for its most recent quarter next week and expects $ 975 million in revenue, lower than the $ 1.1 billion investors had hoped for earlier this year. It is not yet profitable.
Mr. Risher announced a handful of other changes on Thursday. He ended products focused on car rentals, as well as shared rides and luxury rides, and he promoted Kristin Sverchek, the head of business affairs, to president.
Lyft also planned to tell employees that it would reduce their stock grants this year, according to a person familiar with the decision.
The return to office plan, Mr. Risher said, would require workers to come in Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, with Tuesdays recommended, beginning after Labor Day. People will be allowed to work remotely for one month each year, and those living far from offices would not be required to come in.
Mr. Risher said he saw the moment as an opportunity to have a "cultural reset, particularly around decision-making."
He said that Lyft was successful with its early ride-hailing business, but that Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer's idea to build a transportation network, with products focused on scooters, bikes, parking and rental cars, "didn't really resonate with people." The company has pared back those offerings but does still have bikes and scooters.
"So now, my focus is saying, 'Gosh, in ride share alone, there's an enormous amount of innovation left.' People desperately want to get out and live their lives, and we can help them," Mr. Risher said. "And then maybe, over time, we can build some things back on top of that."

Wall Street Ends April on a Positive Note: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed out a winning April with gains Friday after more companies said their profits at the start of the year weren't as bad as expected.
The S&P 500 rose 34.13, or 0.8 percent, to 4,169.48. Despite some sharp swings this week, it still clinched a second straight winning month. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 272.00, or 0.8 percent, to 34,098.16, and the Nasdaq composite gained 84.35, or 0.7 percent, to 12,226.58.
Exxon Mobil did some of the market's heavier lifting after it rose 1.3 percent. It reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than forecast.
Intel gained 4 percent after reporting a milder loss than expected and stronger revenue for the latest quarter. Mondelez International, the food giant behind Oreo and Ritz, rose 3.9 percent after topping Wall Street's estimates. It also raised its forecast for revenue and earnings over the full year.
They helped to offset a 4 percent drop for Amazon, which weighed heavily on the market despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to a slowdown in revenue growth at its AWS cloud computing business.
Snap tumbled 17 percent after its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of forecasts. Pinterest also fell sharply, down 15.7 percent, despite reporting stronger results than expected. Analysts pointed to its growth forecast for the current quarter, which looked more tepid than some expected.
Wall Street has focused heavily on what C.E.O.s are saying about their upcoming trends given how much uncertainty is ahead about where the economy and interest rates are heading. The economy is slowing under the weight of much higher interest rates meant to get high inflation under control.
The majority of companies so far this reporting season have beaten expectations, highlighted by Big Tech behemoths this past week like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. They have an outsized effect on market indexes because of their massive size.
Recent economic reports have kept expectations in place on Wall Street for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again at its next meeting next week.
A report on Friday said the inflation measure that the Fed prefers to use came in close to expectations for March, but it remains well above the target.
Compensation for workers also rose more during the first three months of the year than economists expected. While that's welcome news for workers trying to keep up with still-rising prices at registers, the Fed fears that could help make high inflation more entrenched.
"Bottom line, inflation is still above target, and the Fed is poised to raise interest rates again next week -- and leave them at high levels for quite a while," said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.
High rates combat inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices. That has many investors preparing for a possible recession to hit sometime this year.
The Fed has raised its key overnight interest rate to its highest level since 2007, up from its record low, following a barrage of hikes since early last year. Together, they've already slowed the economy's growth down to an estimated 1.1 percent annual rate at the start of this year.
They've also caused cracks in the banking system, with the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rocking global markets last month. Investors are hunting for other weak links, and the spotlight has been particularly harsh on First Republic Bank.
Its stock roughly halved on Tuesday after it gave details about how much in deposits its customers have yanked. First Republic tumbled again Friday and is down 97.1 percent for the year so far.

Outsize Tech Earnings Buoy Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street rallied to its best day since January after Meta on Thursday became the latest big tech company to blow past profit expectations and reports painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 jumped 2 percent to erase all its losses from what had been a tough week so far. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.6 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 2.4 percent gain.
Facebook's parent company did some of the heaviest lifting, and it jumped 13.9 percent. Not only did Meta beat analysts' estimates for profit during the first three months of the year, it also gave a forecast for revenue that topped expectations.
It joined Microsoft and Alphabet, which reported better-than-expected results earlier in the week, and Amazon followed suit after trading closed for the day.
The majority of companies have been beating forecasts so far this earnings reporting season. Hasbro climbed 14.6 percent, and Comcast rose 10.3 percent after they also topped Wall Street's estimates. But expectations were broadly low coming into this reporting season because of still-high inflation, much higher interest rates and a slowing economy.
A report on Thursday gave the first indication of just how much the U.S. economy is slowing: down to an estimated 1.1 percent growth at an annual rate during the first three months of 2023 from 2.6 percent at the end of last year. That was worse than expected, but the economy may be in better shape than it looks.
Underneath the surface, the report showed strength at the economy's core, with growth in spending by consumers and other areas accelerating. Much of the weakness was related to businesses thinning out inventories. Also within the data, though, was a measure of inflation that the Fed likes to use, which came in hotter than hoped.
A separate report showed that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising hope that the job market may remain resilient.
"In our view, pulled all together, the conflicting data signals to us that we are in the 'bend, not break' phase of the cycle" for the economy, said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-head of portfolio management for multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
Investors took the data to mean the Federal Reserve next week will see the economy is still strong enough to handle another interest rate increase at its next meeting.
Treasury yields jumped immediately after the release of the economic reports as traders raised their forecasts for the Fed and rates.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.53 percent from 3.44 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
High rates have hit some areas of the economy particularly hard, including the housing and manufacturing industries. Banks have also come under pressure.
The hunt has been on for potential weak links, and Wall Street's spotlight has been particularly harsh on First Republic Bank. Its stock has more than halved this week after it gave details about how much in deposits its customers pulled after the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history last month.
Its stock steadied a bit Thursday, rising 8.8 percent.
Caterpillar, considered a bellwether for the global economy, slipped 0.9 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to concerns that its profitability may have maxed out. It also benefited from a bigger-than-expected buildup in dealer inventories.
Crocs tumbled 15.9 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for its latest quarter than expected. The footwear company gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that fell short of some analysts' expectations.

Wynonna Judd: Between Hell and Hallelujah: [Review]

Full text: A documentary about the country star, whose mother and singing partner, Naomi Judd, died last year, mostly fails to kindle unguided emotions.
As portrayed in the new documentary "Wynonna Judd: Between Hell and Hallelujah," the country artist Wynonna Judd experiences, in real time, a cruel kind of suffering. Her mother and longtime singing partner, Naomi Judd, died by suicide last year. In the director Patty Ivins Specht's film, Wynonna is left to pick up the pieces.
The film's wistful opening frames are hauntingly emotional, showing the two women in conversation in their early years of performing as the Judds. But Wynonna is also a superstar with a history of her own, one that Specht's film mostly omits in favor of a sweeping statement about perseverance and the importance of a solid support system in the face of tragedy.
The doc, which captures the singer on a tour she was supposed to share with Naomi, seems content to exist primarily as a lifeline for others who have experienced loss. When Wynonna's sister, the actress Ashley Judd, appears, it's clear they're working on their relationship, but not why they have to. Earlier, though, when Wynonna flips through old family photos at her mother's home, that action is heartbreakingly specific. For the viewer, it's a more palpable feeling.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The rest of "Between Hell and Hallelujah" amounts to a performance-focused tour diary with Hallmark-movie energy. Though Wynonna powers through the songs with admirable grit and grace, Specht's approach is too awkwardly methodical and cloyingly vague to kindle enough unguided emotions. Without those rich details that make a song like the Judds' "Flies on the Butter" come to life, the film plays like a country song with more chorus than verse.

As Sales Slump, Gap Cuts 1,800 Corporate Jobs
The Gap is laying off 1,800 corporate workers, roughly three time the number of headquarters jobs it cut last fall, as the struggling chain cuts costs in a bid to become more nimble. The layoffs a follow similar cuts at large U.S. corporations this year, including Amazon and McDonald's, with white collar workers taking the brunt of the head count reductions as economy slows. In a regulatory filing Thursday, the San Francisco-based chain, which also owns Banana Republic, Old Navy and Athleta, said employees in its San Francisco and New York offices, as well as upper field positions like regional store managers, will be affected. Last September, Gap slashed 500 corporate jobs. Gap's executive chairman, Bob Martin, said the layoffs would lead to $ 300 million in annualized savings. The layoffs should be completed by the end of July, the regulatory filing said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Unilever Raising PricesTo Offset Higher Costs
Despite some signs inflationary pressures are easing, Unilever warned on Thursday of big increases in the prices of dairy, soybean oil, cocoa and sugar in the first half of this year --potentially bad news for fans of its Ben & Jerry's Half Baked ice cream. Unilever, which is passing on about three-quarters of its expenses to consumers, said its profit margins had fallen more than two percentage points as it battles cost inflation that started with the pandemic and worsened with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather. On Thursday, Unilever said it had raised prices by 10.7 percent in the first quarter. "It's principally around the costs of labor, logistics and energy and what our suppliers see in their own production bases," said Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever's finance chief. The worst drought in six decades in Argentina has taken a steep toll on soy farming, while Unilever buys high-end cream from the United States for some of its products. REUTERS

Intel's Forecast Signals Recovering Chip Market
Intel forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, a sign that chip demand was recovering after a downturn wrought by excess supply and a postpandemic slump in the personal computer market. A fall of about 30 percent in firstquarter global personal computer shipments has made some chip industry experts hopeful that a build-up of inventory has cleared out, paving the way for fresh orders. The company forecast secondquarter adjusted revenue in the range of about $ 11.5 billion and $ 12.5 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting revenue of $ 11.75 billion. Intel has also ramped up shipments of its most powerful data center chip, Sapphire Rapids, whose more than one-year delay had allowed its rival Advanced Micro Devices and the ARMbased server CPU makers to take market share from the company.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: British regulators cited the newness of the cloud gaming field to block Microsoft's $ 69 billion acquisition of Activision, a shift in antitrust strategy.
As companies like Google and Facebook grew into giants in the early 21st century, regulators chose largely not to interfere in the still-young market for online services.
Now regulators have reversed course: When it comes to tech, they want to see into the future and beat companies to getting there.
The decision by the British authorities on Wednesday to block Microsoft's $ 69 billion bid for the video game giant Activision Blizzard exemplified the new approach. British officials said a core reason for rejecting the deal was how it could threaten competition in the nascent market for cloud gaming, which lets users stream their favorite video game titles.
That argument is becoming familiar. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which last year sued to block Microsoft's deal for Activision, also raised concerns about competition in cloud gaming, though the agency focused mostly on the impact to the traditional console games business.
Then this month, the F.T.C. ordered the biotech firm Illumina to sell a company that it had acquired, saying the deal could harm competition in the young market for cancer blood tests. And in July, the F.T.C. sued to stop Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, from buying a virtual reality start-up because, the agency said, the purchase would give the tech behemoth unacceptable power over the emerging metaverse.
The actions are part of how governments, frustrated by the speed with which Silicon Valley companies rush to dominate new technologies, are trying to predict how the tech giants could hurt competition in new areas and stop it before it happens.
"Enforcers have to be ahead of the ball on this," said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, which receives some funding from Microsoft.
Regulators' fascination with foreseeing how the tech giants could harm competition stems largely from their perceived failure to do so in the past. In the 1970s and 1980s, courts and regulators made it harder for the government to prove that an acquisition could illegally damage potential future competition. Courts have also said it is hard to sort through the uncertainty of young areas of the economy. So regulators focused largely on whether a deal could hurt competition in mature markets.
Whether the new predictive tack will work for regulators is unclear. In February, a judge ruled against the F.T.C.'s attempt to stop Meta's virtual reality deal. And Illumina has said it plans to appeal the agency's order to sell its blood test company.
Still, divining power plays by the tech giants has become a central goal for lawmakers, activists and regulators who say those companies have too much clout. After arguing that governments were effectively asleep at the wheel while Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple ballooned into giants, many critics are now in government themselves and under pressure to do things differently.
The biggest tech companies, for their part, are jockeying to own the next big thing. Meta is investing heavily in virtual reality, and Apple is working on augmented reality glasses. The explosion of artificial intelligence chatbots has reinvigorated the fight between Google and Microsoft for control of online search.
The F.T.C. and the Justice Department declined to comment specifically on their interest in nascent technologies, beyond earlier statements. Microsoft declined to comment, and the British Competition and Markets Authority did not respond to a request for comment.
The lack of regulatory action as the tech giants mushroomed is well documented. The F.T.C. declined to challenge Facebook's purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, for instance. Then in 2020, the agency sued Facebook over antitrust concerns, arguing that those acquisitions had allowed it to illegally cut off young competitors.
Similarly, the F.T.C. let Google buy the ad software DoubleClick in 2007. This year, the Justice Department said Google had abused a monopoly over the ad market.
Gene Kimmelman, a former member of the Justice Department's antitrust staff who favors more regulation of the tech giants, said regulators in the internet's early days had been gripped by a "reticence to predict what would happen."
"Then you fast-forward 20 years, and there's a lot of critical introspection about why we didn't see what was coming," he said.
By 2021, regulators were looking more at future markets. That year, the F.T.C. sued in its internal court to stop Illumina from buying Grail, which makes blood tests to detect cancer. The judge on the internal court ruled for Illumina, which had already taken the unusual step of closing the deal.
This month, the F.T.C. voted to reverse the judge's ruling and demanded that Illumina sell Grail. Illumina plans to appeal that decision to a traditional federal court.
Last year, the F.T.C. sued to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual reality fitness game, saying it would hurt competition in the market for the so-called metaverse, where users play, work and socialize in virtual worlds. In February, a judge declined to temporarily stop the deal from closing, and the agency abandoned its challenge.
In trying to block Microsoft's purchase of Activision -- the largest consumer tech deal since AOL bought Time Warner decades ago -- the British authorities focused squarely on the deal's impact on cloud gaming, which is currently a niche market.
The officials said cloud gaming could be worth $ 13.7 billion globally by 2026 and worried that Microsoft already accounted for 60 to 70 percent of current services. Microsoft also has the tools to operate an entire cloud gaming ecosystem, from its Azure cloud system to its Xbox services, the agency said.
But cloud gaming is in its infancy, and there is no guarantee that the technology, which requires huge amounts of computing power and often has glitches, will become mainstream. Sales from subscription services that exclusively offer cloud gaming are expected to hit about $ 288 million globally this year, according to Ampere Analysis, a London firm.
"They're predicting what's going to happen," said Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher for Ampere Analysis. "There is some legitimacy to that, but it's hard to predict. It's a very dynamic space."
Antitrust officials appear to be looking ahead to other young technologies, too. At a March event, the Justice Department's top antitrust enforcer, Jonathan Kanter, and the F.T.C.'s chair, Lina Khan, said they thought A.I. products like ChatGPT could be potentially transformational -- and ripe for domination by the tech giants.
"This is another transition that we're looking at closely," Ms. Khan said, "to make sure that if this is an opportunity for competition to really enter the market and disrupt, that we're allowing that to happen rather than illegal tactics locking up the market."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Netflix, which has been struggling recently, announced last week that on Sept. 29 it will cease its 25-year-old DVD-by-mail delivery business to focus on its streaming service. Whereas most functioning members of 21st-century culture greeted the news with indifference or puzzlement -- "People still use DVDs?" -- the announcement hit me with a jolt of dread and dismay.
In the face of pity from viewers of all ages, I've boasted for years, perhaps with a touch of hyperbole, of being the last paying subscriber of DVD.com, the spinoff division Netflix created in 2011. I was the kind of full-throttle loyalist who actively urged others to switch back to the vestigial anomaly that was DVD.com -- the O.G. Netflix, to those of us who lived and breathed during the previous century. I also refused to upgrade. A colleague once went so far as to set up an HBO Max trial account for me and shove it into my inbox. "You'll be converted," he said with the assurance of someone who understands accepted behavioral norms.
But I had been happy bucking the norm! My devotion to DVD.com is not about Luddite resistance or stubborn nostalgia. It's a choice and it's about better choices. Choice in all senses of the word -- about simultaneously expanding and narrowing my options, about active decisions over passive ones, about human curation as opposed to the algorithm.
Let me explain. Netflix pays for streaming rights to films and programs it does not own the rights to, which means that films come and go on the service according to the terms of those contracts. But DVD.com offered all its movies and TV shows at all times. Last week, for example, I watched two movies not currently available on Netflix: 1979's "The China Syndrome" and 1980's "Altered States," both period paranoia fare and reflective of the sort of niche moods and obsessions that populate my maxed-out 500-disc-long queue. If I want to go deep into Albert Finney, I can line up nearly every film of his, from "Tom Jones" to "The Gathering Storm." I can toggle movies upward if I grow impatient to see something I added three years earlier.
Or I can allow for serendipity -- movies appear in my mailbox that I barely remember adding in the first place. I can play a kind of guessing game around what precipitated a particular whim. Was it Jeanne Moreau's obituary? A retrospective at MoMA? The site's regularly maintained "forthcoming release" page, which I checked religiously? During the service's glory days, you could easily sort movies by country of origin and display them in chronological order. The Criterion Collection was in there, sure, but so was "Alien³." You could add not-yet-available movies to a special "saved" section when you'd missed the theatrical release or before an old film existed on DVD.
The choices were broader but my options were narrower, because on my subscription plan, I would have only four movies available to me at any given time. When I visited homes that subscribed to every streaming service from Amazon Prime to Disney+, I felt paralyzed by the surfeit of possibilities, like Robin Williams floored in the coffee aisle in "Moscow on the Hudson" (available, yes, on DVD.com). As the psychologist Barry Schwartz documented in his seminal book, "The Paradox of Choice," more is, in fact, often less -- having too many options can send us into a tailspin.
I started on Netflix's DVDs 20 years ago, while I was dating the man who became my husband, an early customer of what was then known simply as Netflix. This was well before streaming led the company to spin off DVD.com like a discarded training bra, a source of shame to what had become an entertainment behemoth. He allowed me into his account the way a boyfriend offers a spare dresser drawer. Tentatively at first, I added movies I wanted to watch to his queue. Soon I was working the list, pushing my choices ahead of his. "Did you delete my Buster Keaton?" he'd ask while I pretended to clean out the refrigerator. As happens with any long-married couple, we eventually worked it out in that I essentially took over the account and he moved on to more advanced technologies.
There is a cost to clinging to products and services as they shuffle off into obsolescence. Like a mom-and-pop video store with a desperate "Everything must go!" sign in its window, the service starts to decline as employees are laid off. On DVD.com, the "coming soon" feature disappeared a few years ago and the responses to my forlorn emails to customer service essentially said, "Yeah, sorry." Like a half-empty shelf in aisle 4, the new "user interface" eliminated the drop-down menu of foreign movies by language; the once assiduously updated "new releases" became a vague "new and popular."
When the portable DVD player that I perched on the elliptical machine in my basement petered out after 12 workhorse years last winter, I excitedly ordered a new one. "Surely it will be better than the old jalopy!" I told myself. But companies have few incentives to upgrade dying technology. My replacement DVD player offered fewer amenities than its predecessor. It mutters out movie dialogue reluctantly, barely exceeding the swooshing sounds of the elliptical treads.
Here I must make a confession: I am not, in fact, impervious to the lure of streaming. My secret affair started during lockdown with an Apple TV+ account I rationalized as "part of the computer." I soon added a press account or two for streaming services because I "needed them for work." When I watch films or series on these services I tell myself it is purely part of covering the culture and not actively participating in it. The truth is, I have started enjoying these services. Delete this paragraph after reading.
So yes, I have been slightly cheating on DVD.com. But I'm still not ready for the relationship to end. My alternative partners look as unappealing as photo-less profiles on an astrology-based dating app: I do not want to watch movies on an iPad, where all kinds of notifications may interrupt. Streaming movies don't include fun DVD extras like deleted scenes, director commentaries and original trailers. Surely, I would never actually buy DVDs for movies I want to watch just once. I pity anyone who has missed out on the pleasures of DVD.com, just as I pity the kids who never knew the joys of Le Video or the original Kim's Video or even an especially well-stocked Blockbuster. You still have five months left.

U.K. Blocks Microsoft's Acquisition of Activision: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The decision barring the takeover of a big video game publisher is a major victory for proponents of regulating tech giants, which have faced obstacles in the United States.
British antitrust regulators dealt a major setback on Wednesday to Microsoft's plans to acquire the video game giant Activision Blizzard for $ 69 billion, blocking the proposed deal and handing a notable win to government enforcers around the world who want to rein in Big Tech.
With its ruling, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority inflicted a possibly fatal blow to what would be the largest consumer tech acquisition since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago. The agency said Microsoft's proposals to ensure that the acquisition would not harm competition "failed to effectively address the concerns in the cloud gaming sector," a nascent part of the gaming industry.
The surprising ruling bolstered an effort by the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal in the United States and was a clear victory for proponents of regulating tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, Facebook's parent company. Their efforts, fueled by fears that the companies wield too much power over online commerce and communications, have been stymied by recent court losses and legislative failures.
"This is a very big win for the broader effort to realign antitrust enforcement," said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C. Microsoft said it planned to appeal the ruling.
Much of the focus around whether the deal would harm consumers had focused on the market for expensive gaming consoles, but the Competition and Markets Authority zeroed in on cloud gaming, a relatively new technology that allows people to stream games to their devices, circumventing the need for hardware like gaming consoles.
The ruling was an indication that regulators around the world are broadening their antitrust lens to include emerging markets and are intent on helping to shape them before a handful of giant companies can dominate them. A failure to gain approval in a large market like Britain or the United States could force Microsoft to walk away from the acquisition, even though another regulatory body in the European Union has not made a final decision.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has made challenging mergers a central part of her plan to rein in the tech giants. After the American agency filed a lawsuit in December to block the video game deal, Microsoft swiftly tried to isolate Ms. Khan by pushing European authorities to reach legal settlements that would address their concerns and allow the deal to go through. Antitrust regulators in the European Union are expected to rule on the acquisition by May 22.
But the British officials instead signaled that an era of easy blockbuster tech deals was over. The F.T.C. is building an antitrust case against Amazon, and Ms. Khan has said she is closely watching whether the tech giants will abuse their power in the race to develop artificial intelligence tools.
On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it was aligned with the British regulator. "We also have concerns, as explained in our complaint, about the anticompetitive effects of this deal," Holly Vedova, the director of the agency's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.
Microsoft has said it wants to close the Activision acquisition by July 18. If its appeal fails, the company will probably have to walk away and pay a $ 3 billion breakup fee to Activision, ending what would have been one of the biggest shake-ups to the gaming industry in decades.
"We're especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said in a statement.
Activision, the publisher of blockbuster games like Call of Duty, said it would "work aggressively" with Microsoft to reverse the ruling.
"If the C.M.A.'s decision holds, it would stifle investment, competition and job creation throughout the U.K. gaming industry," said Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive.
Activision's stock fell 11 percent by the close of trading. Shares of Microsoft, which were trading higher after it reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, rose 7 percent on Wednesday.
Microsoft announced the deal to buy Activision early last year, hoping to combine Microsoft's Xbox console and video game subscription service with Activision's blockbuster games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
At the time, Activision was reeling from a California lawsuit accusing it of fostering a toxic, sexist workplace culture, and Mr. Kotick faced calls to resign.
For more than a year, the debate over the deal largely centered on what would happen to the hundreds of millions of people who played Activision's games. The company that opposed the deal the most vocally was Sony, which makes the PlayStation console, a competitor to Microsoft's Xbox. Sony argued that fans of Call of Duty and other Activision titles who can currently play the games on the Xbox or PlayStation would be forced to use Microsoft's consoles and services exclusively.
Sony declined to comment on the ruling.
Microsoft said it would not restrict Call of Duty to the Xbox, and it argued that the acquisition would give more people access to the games. It focused on reaching settlements with regulators outside the United States that would allow the deal to go through with some conditions. It also offered gaming platforms guaranteed access to Call of Duty in an effort to show it would not restrict the popular game on other consoles.
The British regulator initially said in February that the deal would hurt competition for gaming consoles like the PlayStation and the nascent cloud gaming industry, which involves harnessing the power of remote data centers to stream a game to a device like an iPhone or a computer. But in late March, it reversed course and said it no longer believed the deal posed a threat to Sony, which seemed to put Microsoft in a strong position.
Instead, the Competition and Markets Authority focused on the cloud gaming market, which has been around for just a few years, and on the possibility that cloud gaming could explode in popularity, eventually being worth $ 1.3 billion in Britain and $ 14 billion globally by 2026.
"The cloud allows U.K. gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play," the agency wrote in its ruling on Wednesday. "Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities."
In the future, cloud gaming could untether gamers from consoles and shift the focus from hardware to technology that allows games to be streamed from remote data centers. Paired with Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's monthly game subscription service, which has more than 25 million subscribers, it could be a powerful tool. But it has not yet been widely adopted, and early forays into cloud gaming, from companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, have struggled. The technology still encounters frequent glitches and requires a strong Wi-Fi connection.
"Cloud gaming longer term could be very big, but it would require a massive shift in how games are made and sold," said David Gibson, a senior analyst for MST Financial, a financial services company based in Australia.
In recent months, Microsoft signed a number of deals promising it would allow Activision's games to be played for 10 years on cloud streaming platforms, such as Nvidia's GeForce Now streaming service. But the Competition and Markets Authority said those solutions did not cover enough cloud business models.
The agency said Microsoft already accounted for 60 to 70 percent of cloud gaming services worldwide. If the deal closed, the agency said, Microsoft was likely to benefit from making Activision's games exclusive to its own cloud gaming platform, Xbox Cloud Gaming, which could harm consumers.
"This deal would strengthen that advantage giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors," Martin Coleman, the chair of a panel that conducted an investigation for the agency, said in a statement.
The appeals process is likely to be relatively swift, but Microsoft will have to meet a high bar: The tribunal that oversees appeals looks mainly at whether a ruling was reached lawfully and reasonably, according to Pablo Ibáñez Colomo, a professor of law at the London School of Economics.
"This is a significant blow to the deal completing," said Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher at the analytics firm Ampere Analysis in London. "Inevitably this will delay things and will impact Xbox's commercial plans."

Much of the focus around whether the deal would harm consumers had focused on the market for expensive gaming consoles, but the CMA zeroed in on cloud gaming, a relatively new technology that allows people to stream games to their devices, circumventing the need for hardware like gaming consoles.
The ruling was an indication that regulators around the world are broadening their antitrust lens to include emerging markets and are intent on helping to shape them before a handful of giant companies can dominate them. A failure to gain approval in a large market like Britain or the United States could force Microsoft to walk away from the acquisition, even though another regulatory body in the European Union has not made a final decision.
Lina Khan, the FTC chair, has made challenging mergers a central part of her plan to rein in the tech giants. After the American agency filed a lawsuit in December to block the video game deal, Microsoft swiftly tried to isolate Khan by pushing European authorities to reach legal settlements that would address their concerns and allow the deal to go through. Antitrust regulators in the European Union are expected to rule on the acquisition by May 22.
But the British officials instead signaled that an era of easy blockbuster tech deals was over. The FTC is building an antitrust case against Amazon, and Khan has said she is closely watching whether the tech giants will abuse their power in the race to develop artificial intelligence tools.
On Wednesday, the FTC said it was aligned with the British regulator. “We also have concerns, as explained in our complaint, about the anticompetitive effects of this deal,” Holly Vedova, the director of the agency’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.
Microsoft has said it wants to close the Activision acquisition by July 18. If its appeal fails, the company will probably have to walk away and pay a $3 billion breakup fee to Activision, ending what would have been one of the biggest shake-ups to the gaming industry in decades.
“We’re especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in a statement.
Activision, the publisher of blockbuster games like Call of Duty, said it would “work aggressively” with Microsoft to reverse the ruling.
“If the CMA’s decision holds, it would stifle investment, competition and job creation throughout the U.K. gaming industry,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision’s CEO.
Activision’s stock fell 11% by the close of trading. Shares of Microsoft, which were trading higher after it reported stronger-than-expected earnings Tuesday, rose 7% Wednesday.
Microsoft announced the deal to buy Activision early last year, hoping to combine Microsoft’s Xbox console and video game subscription service with Activision’s blockbuster games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
At the time, Activision was reeling from a California lawsuit accusing it of fostering a toxic, sexist workplace culture, and Kotick faced calls to resign.
For more than a year, the debate over the deal largely centered on what would happen to the hundreds of millions of people who play Activision’s games. The company that opposed the deal the most vocally was Sony, which makes the PlayStation console, a competitor to Microsoft’s Xbox. Sony argued that fans of Call of Duty and other Activision titles who can currently play the games on the Xbox or PlayStation would be forced to use Microsoft’s consoles and services exclusively.
Sony declined to comment on the ruling.
Microsoft said it would not restrict Call of Duty to the Xbox, and it argued the acquisition would give more people access to the games. It focused on reaching settlements with regulators outside the United States that would allow the deal to go through with some conditions. It also offered gaming platforms guaranteed access to Call of Duty in an effort to show it would not restrict the popular game on other consoles.
The British regulator initially said in February that the deal would hurt competition for gaming consoles like the PlayStation and the nascent cloud gaming industry, which involves harnessing the power of remote data centers to stream a game to a device like an iPhone or a computer. But in late March, it reversed course and said that it no longer believed the deal posed a threat to Sony, which seemed to put Microsoft in a strong position.
Instead, the CMA focused on the cloud gaming market, which has been around for just a few years, and on the possibility that cloud gaming could explode in popularity, eventually being worth $1.3 billion in Britain and $14 billion globally by 2026.
“The cloud allows U.K. gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play,” the CMA wrote in its ruling Wednesday. “Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities.”
In the future, cloud gaming could untether gamers from consoles and shift the focus from hardware to technology that allows games to be streamed from remote data centers. Paired with Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s monthly game subscription service that has more than 25 million subscribers, it could be a powerful tool. But it has not yet been widely adopted, and early forays into cloud gaming from companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon have struggled. The technology still encounters frequent glitches and requires a strong Wi-Fi connection.
“Cloud gaming longer term could be very big, but it would require a massive shift in how games are made and sold,” said David Gibson, a senior analyst for MST Financial, a financial services company based in Australia.
In recent months, Microsoft signed a number of deals promising it would allow Activision’s games to be played for 10 years on cloud streaming platforms, such as Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service. But the CMA said those solutions did not cover enough cloud business models.
The agency said Microsoft already accounted for 60% to 70% of cloud gaming services worldwide. If the deal closed, the agency said, Microsoft was likely to benefit from making Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud gaming platform, Xbox Cloud Gaming, which could harm consumers.
“This deal would strengthen that advantage giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors,” Martin Coleman, the chair of a panel that conducted an investigation for the CMA, said in a statement.
The appeals process is likely to be relatively swift, but Microsoft will have to meet a high bar: The tribunal that oversees appeals looks mainly at whether a ruling was reached lawfully and reasonably, according to Pablo Ibáñez Colomo, a professor of law at the London School of Economics.
“This is a significant blow to the deal completing,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher at the analytics firm Ampere Analysis in London. “Inevitably this will delay things and will impact Xbox’s commercial plans.”

Full text: The retailer is closing its stores, leaving many longtime customers scrambling to make sure they get their goods -- at a discount.
For many shoppers, Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy filing on Sunday was a call to action.
Customers -- both loyal and lapsed -- received an email from the home-goods retailer around 8 a.m. telling them that the company had decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores would soon be closing, as would its 120 Buy Buy Baby locations.
Shoppers have until Wednesday to use their coupons. Around the country, they rounded up the ubiquitous blue slips of paper offering 20 percent off, stuffed them in pouches and plastic bags, and made their way to the nearest Bed Bath & Beyond.
At a store in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Monday, Sylvia Ward, a self-described Bed Bath & Beyond aficionado from the Bronx, said news of the closings had "absolutely devastated" her. Then she learned she had only a few days to use coupons.
"I had to run down here today!" she said.
Ms. Ward said she had brought about seven coupons to use toward items including two Simplehuman soap dispensers, kitchen timers and about 14 packets of Clorox wipes, estimating that she saved $ 30.
Bed Bath & Beyond, which opened in 1971, held unique cultural cachet among big-box retailers. It served as a recurring story line on Comedy Central's "Broad City"; a plot device for Adam Sandler's 2006 movie, "Click"; and a talking point for celebrities showcasing their relatability on late-night shows. Facebook groups were formed for people to trade the retailer's coupons.
Over the decades, those coupons reliably showed up in millions of mailboxes -- and, more recently, email inboxes -- offering a discount on home goods like kitchen gadgets, fluffy pillows and wooden hangers. People gave them as gifts to new homeowners and college students, kept them in kitchen junk drawers and car glove compartments. At least one customer used them as a calling card, writing their phone number on the back of the coupons and handing them to fellow patrons deemed attractive.
A steady flow of customers moved through the Bed Bath & Beyond store in Chelsea on Sunday. People milled around looking at towel heaters and large pillows. While some asked employees in blue aprons where they could find certain products, they also took the time to ask how the workers were feeling about the location's closing.
Bobbi Kimberly was one of those customers. The chain's bankruptcy news was the motivation she needed to finally use a coupon she had been holding on to and to see the store again before it shut down.
"It's like you're losing a buddy, because it's something that's dependable," Ms. Kimberly, a yoga instructor, said. She said she would miss roaming the stores, which kept her active and social.
After hearing about the bankruptcy, loyal Bed Bath & Beyond customers took to social media. The company's name became a trending topic on Twitter. People shared odes to the retailer, posted TikTok videos of themselves walking into stores and alerted their friends and families to the chain's closing through their Facebook statuses. Reddit threads about Bed Bath & Beyond, which became a "meme stock" favorite during the pandemic, lit up with chatter about its downfall.
Some shoppers handed unused coupons to other customers in stores and texted friends and family, encouraging them to use theirs before it was too late.
The outpouring of support came too late for Bed Bath & Beyond. Despite a boost early in the pandemic, when quarantined Americans bought items to spruce up their homes, sales soon started to fall precipitously. The retailer's supply chain was strained, operational costs rose, and vendors held back on shipping inventory when they grew nervous about being paid on time.
In recent months, Bed Bath & Beyond store shoppers were met with sparsely stocked shelves. The chain had been slashing hundreds of jobs and closing stores to try to survive. In its bankruptcy filing, it said the "past 12 months have undoubtedly been the most difficult and turbulent in Bed Bath & Beyond's storied history."
Jean Massaro was in a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Yonkers on Monday morning with her coupons in tow. She said she didn't shop online and had ignored the discounts the retailer emailed to her in favor of the tangible ones she had, some collected from People magazine.
"I really, really love this store," Ms. Massaro said. "I'm upset, and so are a lot of other people."
But it has been years since Bed Bath & Beyond was at its peak. In 2020, it said it would pull back on sending shoppers coupons after investors questioned if they hurt the company's margins. Shoppers recoiled, with the decision seeming like one in a growing list of ways that the chain was taking away the things that customers loved most about their shopping experience.
"I used to come here a lot," said David Salidor, who swung by a location in Manhattan with some coupons on Monday. "It's because they have stuff that a lot of stores don't have."
He added: "I'm sorry to see it go. But it's strange times, strange times."
Some store visitors on Monday were disappointed that they didn't see eye-popping sales. The deep discounts characteristic of liquidation sales won't start until Wednesday -- once Bed Bath & Beyond stops accepting coupons. The company said it expected that customers would be able to use gift cards until May 8.
For shoppers who have baby and wedding registries, the company said it would work with an alternative platform to transfer their data. Some Bed Bath & Beyond customers said they were likely to go to retailers like T.J. Maxx, Kohl's and Amazon to fill the void.
Thea Derecola, a hairstylist and an educator in Chelsea, took a pouch of coupons to the store and used them to buy two pillows for 20 percent off. Without the coupons, she said, she thought the pillows would have cost less on Amazon.
Her doorman used to save Bed Bath & Beyond coupons for her, said Ms. Derecola, a longtime shopper who used to work across the street and visit the store weekly.
Daniel Duque, a retired teacher in Brooklyn Heights, said he hoped this wasn't really the end of Bed Bath & Beyond, which expects all of its locations to be closed by June 30.
"I'm still waiting for a miracle," he said. For years, he had shopped in the store, but stopped going as much after moving to Brooklyn.
A feeling of nostalgia is common when a retailer goes out of business. It's similar to the response that shoppers had when Toys "R" Us filed for bankruptcy, said Joanie Demer, co-founder of Krazy Coupon Lady, an online community that shares discounting tips and deals.
"There's all this altruism for the brand all of a sudden," Ms. Demer said. "It's like, OK, but you weren't shopping there. You've been shopping on Amazon like the rest of us."
Chelsea Gordon, an Atlanta entrepreneur who owns the Cooking Code, didn't learn about Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy until Sunday evening. She had been spending the day prepping meals with kitchen gadgets, like her juicer, that she had bought from the retailer.
She's a frequent shopper. Last year, she used Bed Bath & Beyond for her house registry and Buy Buy Baby to register gifts for her baby shower.
When learning she had only a few days to use her coupons, Ms. Gordon made a plan to head to her nearby store on Monday morning right after her Pilates class. She said she also wanted to make sure her mother had heard the news since they often texted about Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.
"That coupon, it's going to be one less thing to talk about," Ms. Gordon said with a sigh.

Markets Hold Breath Ahead of New Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street remained stuck in its standstill on Monday, and stocks again moved only modestly ahead of reports that could offer more clarity on the direction of the economy and corporate profits.
The S&P 500 edged up by 3.52 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,137.04 after barely budging last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.44, or 0.2 percent, to 33,875.40, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 35.25, or 0.3 percent, to 12,037.20.
Coca-Cola fell 0.2 percent after it reported stronger-than-expected profit for the first quarter but refrained from raising forecasts for sales and other measures for the full year. It was the only company in the S&P 500 to report Monday morning, but more than 170 others are scheduled to follow it this week.
The question is whether they can clear the low bar that Wall Street has set for them, and what chief executives say about their prospects for profits later this year. Analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report their worst drop in earnings since the spring of 2020, when the pandemic paralyzed the economy.
Some of Wall Street's most influential companies are set to report this week, including Microsoft on Tuesday and Amazon on Thursday. Several of these big tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 1.4 percent, and Amazon dipped 0.7 percent.
Fox fell 2.9 percent after it said the prime-time host Tucker Carlson was leaving Fox News. The move came less than a week after the company reached a $ 787.5 million settlement over charges that it promoted lies about Dominion Voting Systems through its 2020 election coverage.
Bed Bath & Beyond was another loser, dropping 35.7 percent to 19 cents after filing for bankruptcy protection. Its stock has been on a wild ride as investors bet on whether it could successfully turn around its operations.
So far this earnings reporting season, the majority of companies have been topping forecasts, as is usually the case. That is partly because expectations were so low coming into it. Inflation remains high, and interest rates are much higher than a year earlier, which has hurt swaths of the economy.
The Federal Reserve has jacked up rates at a furious pace in hopes of undercutting high inflation. High rates can do that but only by bluntly slowing the entire economy. That increases the chances of a recession, while also hurting prices for investments.
Besides this week's blizzard of earnings reports, Wall Street was also waiting for the first estimate of how quickly the U.S. economy grew in the first three months of the year. Economists predict it will show growth slowed to 1.9 percent at an annual rate, from 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
Higher rates have already slowed the housing market by making mortgages more expensive. Manufacturing and other areas of the economy have also been hurt, while the job market has remained remarkably resilient.
The report on the U.S. economy will be one of the final pieces of data before the Federal Reserve's next meeting, scheduled for next week. Much of Wall Street expects it to raise interest rates at least one more time, before it most likely takes a pause.
Many traders are betting the Fed will have to cut rates later this year to prop up the economy. But the Fed has been insistent that it will hold rates at a higher level at least through the end of this year.
"The Fed seems determined to fight inflation even if a more significant slowdown arrives," Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson wrote in a report.
High rates have already caused cracks in the banking system, with the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rocking markets last month. The worst of the crisis seems to have passed, but scrutiny is still high on smaller and midsize banks, which seem to be under the biggest threat of customers' yanking their deposits.

Full text: The company, which failed to fully reckon with the rise of online shopping, said that store closing sales would begin on Wednesday.
Bed Bath & Beyond came out of the 2008 downturn a winner. While competitors like Sharper Image and Linens 'n Things filed for bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond actually expanded its business by acquiring other retailers. Its home-goods emporiums full of towels and kitchen aids -- all available at a reduced price with that Big Blue coupon -- were beacons that kept shoppers coming back.
Now, as the U.S. economy experiences another period of uncertainty, Bed Bath & Beyond is no longer on top, the result of an increasingly unwieldy corporate structure and its failure to fully reckon with the ascendance of online shopping.
On Sunday, the 52-year-old retailer said it was filing for bankruptcy protection in United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. It said it would start the process of closing the company's 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 120 Buy Buy Baby locations on Wednesday and seek to sell parts of its business. In its Chapter 11 filing, the company said it expected all stores to close by June 30.
It will stop accepting its coupons on Wednesday, when its store closing sales begin. Customers will have until May 8 to use Bed Bath & Beyond gift cards. The company did not specify when its store apps would shut down, saying only that customers could continue using them "at this time."
"Thank you to all of our loyal customers," the company said on its website. "We have made the difficult decision to begin winding down our operations."
To help fund its operations in bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond has raised $ 240 million from the investment firm Sixth Street Specialty Lending.
The company's decline offers a glimpse into the forces shaping the post-pandemic retail landscape. For companies like Bed Bath & Beyond, whose financial problems were masked as consumers rushed to spend their stimulus money, the economic concerns of the past few months are exposing those weaknesses. It will become even more crucial for retailers to adapt as shoppers cut back on discretionary spending.
"We are going to see the Darwinism of retail" play out in 2023, said Michael Lasser, a retail analyst at UBS who has covered Bed Bath & Beyond for 16 years.
The past several years have been tumultuous for retailers. In 2020, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J. Crew all filed for bankruptcy. But in the past two years, retailers have benefited from U.S. consumers' willingness to spend. Now, as shoppers are being more discerning about their purchases, more companies will be at risk.
The retail landscape looked much different when Bed Bath & Beyond was started in 1971 as a way to compete with the home goods sections of department stores. The company's founders, Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, opened the chain's first stores in New York and New Jersey. The venture was originally called Bed 'n Bath, a nod to their narrow line of merchandise.
Compared with a store like Macy's, the upstart retailer promised a larger selection of bedsheets, towels, shower curtains and other home necessities. As their merchandise assortment and store base expanded, the retailer was renamed Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987. It went public in 1992.
It embraced innovation, former executives and employees said. Instead of TV ads, Bed Bath & Beyond relied on word-of-mouth advertising and the large coupons it delivered to millions of Americans mailboxes. Countless shoppers would keep those 20 percent off cards in their cars or junk drawers, a reminder to head to the retailer if they were considering, say, a new toaster.
Bed Bath & Beyond also had a decentralized warehouse strategy that allowed store managers to be more flexible in ordering the merchandise that would appeal most to shoppers at their location.
It was also early to use integrated digital technology within its stores. Instructional videos would play in front of displays for items like SodaStreams or juicers, so shoppers would get a sense of how they could be used at home. It started its website in 1999.
In 2000, Bed Bath & Beyond had 311 stores. A decade later, it had 1,100. From 2002 until 2012, the company acquired Harmon Stores, Christmas Tree Shops, Buy Buy Baby and Cost Plus World Market. The brands helped diversify the company from a retail perspective, but the moves also diverted management's focus away from other crucial investments, like its e-commerce business, according to Richard McMahon, who held various executive titles at the company, including chief strategy officer, over 17 years before leaving in 2015.
"There wasn't as much focus put on the organic business -- Bed Bath & Beyond -- and evolving that business to consumer behavior," Mr. McMahon said. "The internet started to become real, and consumer behavior was changing through that process."
Competitors like Amazon, Target and Walmart were investing in making the online experience better for shoppers, and Bed Bath & Beyond saw its market share dip. Google searches also worked against it because the 20 percent discounts were not factored in online, leading shoppers to believe that retailers like Amazon offered better deals.
"Looking back on it," Mr. McMahon said, "we could have been investing better in evolving the core business than some of these other acquisitions."
In 2014, Bed Bath & Beyond got into the debt market for the first time by selling $ 1.5 billion in bonds to buy back stock. Many retailers avoid taking on debt, well aware of the industry volatility that can quickly turn a reasonable debt load into a serious financial burden. Mr. Lasser, the UBS analyst, described the move as a "seminal event" and wondered if it was an attempt to raise the company's stock price to fend off activist investors.
If that was the intent, it wasn't a long-term solution. In 2019, a trio of activist investors -- Legion Partners, Macellum Advisors and Ancora Advisors -- won a fight with the retailer that gave them the choice of four new board members and, eventually, a chief executive they supported: Mark Tritton of Target, the first top executive to come from outside the company.
Much of the workplace culture at Bed Bath & Beyond soon changed. There were layoffs. Store managers had less say over which items would be stocked in their stores. Mr. Tritton, who left the company last year, declined to comment on his tenure.
When the pandemic came, Bed Bath & Beyond joined other retailers in dealing with supply chain problems. But the company's decentralized system complicated things further, and its e-commerce technology was less advanced than many of its biggest competitors.
Revenue in 2020 fell to $ 2.6 billion, a 16 percent drop from 2019. What had once been a manageable debt load quickly became unsustainable.
As the company looked for places to cut costs, it started to undo the things that people loved about Bed Bath & Beyond. In 2020, the retailer said it would scale back on mailing its trademark coupons. It moved away from national, well-known brands in favor of making its own batch of private label brands, which usually have better margins. To make stores feel more open, it removed items and tore down its 14-foot-tall tower of towels.
Shoppers noticed.
"Bed Bath & Beyond had almost become a manual for how to adult," said Chris Dancy, 54, a once-loyal Bed Bath & Beyond shopper who was introduced to the brand in their early 20s.
Mr. Dancy used to go into their stores weekly, but after the coupon was scaled back, so too were the visits.
"The allure of having the Willy Wonka golden ticket -- or blue ticket -- was gone," Mr. Dancy said.
When reached on Sunday after the bankruptcy news, Mr. Dancy was preparing to go to the store that afternoon with their husband and plenty of coupons to purchase sheets, a Roomba, an air fryer and whatever else jumped out.
"I just don't want to go in there and drop two grand but I probably will," Mr. Dancy said.
In August, the company announced an aggressive restructuring plan, saying it would close 150 stores and lay off more workers. Just a few days later, the retailer was thrown into emotional tumult when its chief financial officer, Gustavo Arnal, died, a death that was ruled a suicide.
Bed Bath & Beyond's suppliers started to get spooked and began demanding payment upfront. That led to in-stock levels around 70 percent during the past holiday season, according to Sue Gove, who became the permanent chief executive in October.
In early February, the company sidestepped bankruptcy after coming up with a plan to use a public stock offering to raise more than $ 1 billion. The plan, backed by Hudson Bay Capital Management, was good only so long as Bed Bath & Beyond's stock stayed above $ 1 a share. This month, the retailer canceled that deal after its terms were breached. Its stock closed at 29 cents a share on Friday.
All the while, sales continued to fall, starving the company of the cash -- and confidence -- necessary to keep suppliers shipping to its stores.
"It's a death spiral," said Neil Saunders, the managing director at GlobalData's retail division. "If you can't get the stock, you can't make the sales. If you can't make the sales, your credit deteriorates. If your credit deteriorates, people are less willing to supply you. That cycle seems impossible to break."

In 2020, the retailer said it would scale back on mailing its trademark coupons. It moved away from national, well-known brands in favor of making its own batch of private label brands, which usually have better margins. To make stores feel more open, it removed items and tore down its 14-foot-tall tower of towels.
Shoppers noticed.
“Bed Bath & Beyond had almost become a manual for how to adult,” said Chris Dancy, 54, a once-loyal Bed Bath & Beyond shopper who was introduced to the brand in his early 20s.
Dancy used to go into their stores weekly, but after the coupon was scaled back, so too were the visits.
“The allure of having the Willy Wonka golden ticket — or blue ticket — was gone,” Dancy said.
When reached Sunday after the bankruptcy news, Dancy was preparing to go to the store that afternoon with their husband and plenty of coupons to purchase sheets, a Roomba, an air fryer and whatever else jumped out.
“I just don’t want to go in there and drop two grand but I probably will,” Dancy said.
In August, the company announced an aggressive restructuring plan, saying it would close 150 stores and lay off more workers. Just a few days later, the retailer was thrown into emotional tumult when its chief financial officer, Gustavo Arnal, died, a death that was ruled a suicide.
Bed Bath & Beyond’s suppliers started to get spooked and began demanding payment upfront. That led to in-stock levels around 70% during the past holiday season, according to Sue Gove, who became the permanent CEO in October.
In early February, the company sidestepped bankruptcy after coming up with a plan to use a public stock offering to raise more than $1 billion. The plan, backed by Hudson Bay Capital Management, was good only so long as Bed Bath & Beyond’s stock stayed above $1 a share. This month, the retailer canceled that deal after its terms were breached. Its stock closed at 29 cents a share Friday.
All the while, sales continued to fall, starving the company of the cash — and confidence — necessary to keep suppliers shipping to its stores.
“It’s a death spiral,” said Neil Saunders, the managing director at GlobalData’s retail division. “If you can’t get the stock, you can’t make the sales. If you can’t make the sales, your credit deteriorates. If your credit deteriorates, people are less willing to supply you. That cycle seems impossible to break.”

Lyft Plans To Cut Costs With Layoffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Browning, Kellen

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The cuts come as the company tries to lower prices and remain competitive with Uber, its larger rival.
Lyft, which has struggled financially while trying to compete with its rival, Uber, said on Friday that it was planning major job cuts.
The layoffs, which are expected next week, will affect about 1,200 people, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It is the first significant move by David Risher, the company's new chief executive. Mr. Risher had been considering the cuts for several weeks, the person said, even though his first official day as the company's C.E.O. was on Monday.
"We need to bring our costs down to deliver affordable rides, compelling earnings for drivers and profitable growth," Mr. Risher said in a note to employees. He added that money saved from the downsizing would be used to "invest in competitive pricing, faster pick-up times and better driver earnings."
Mr. Risher said that employees would be notified next Thursday if they had lost their jobs, and that Lyft offices would be closed that day.
News of the job cuts at Lyft, which has about 4,000 employees, was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
"This is a hard decision, and one we're not making lightly," Sona Iliffe-Moon, a Lyft spokeswoman, said in a statement. "But the result will be a far stronger, more competitive Lyft."
Lyft announced in March that Mr. Risher, a former Amazon and Microsoft executive who served on Lyft's board, would take over for John Zimmer and Logan Green, the company's founders. Both men are leaving their executive positions but staying at the company as members of the board.
Lyft has long been a distant second to Uber, which has emerged from the pandemic in a stronger position, partly because of its investment in food delivery and a global ride-hailing business.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its staff. In February, the company reported record revenue but warned it would be slowed by economic challenges as it worked to lower prices. Mr. Risher has said that keeping prices competitive will be a key part of his strategy to differentiate Lyft from Uber.
Lyft employees had been anticipating layoffs for months. Business consultants had been brought in to ask departments to justify their budgets and make cost-cutting recommendations, three current and former employees said, and company executives had been hinting throughout the spring that more workers could lose their jobs.
Employees expected the layoffs to come by mid-April, before managers were scheduled to write yearly performance reviews and executives had to decide on compensation for the year.

Slight Gains in Markets After Quiet Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/slight-gains-markets-after-quiet-week/docview/2804209713/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks capped a listless day of trading Friday with slight gains for the major stock indexes, closing out a quiet week on Wall Street highlighted by a batch of mostly mixed corporate earnings reports.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite all gained 0.1 percent after drifting between small gains and losses for most of the day. The indexes each posted a slight loss for the week.
Health care companies and a range of consumer product makers gained ground, tempering losses in banks, technology stocks and elsewhere. Truist Financial and KeyCorp, two of the larger regional banks, were among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500. Truist fell 6 percent and KeyCorp ended 3.7 percent lower.
Bond yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates and other loans, rose to 3.56 percent from 3.54 percent late Thursday.
Trading was muted as investors focused on the latest corporate earnings reports and forecasts in a bid to get a better sense of how companies are handling high inflation, a slowing economy and fears about a recession.
"You have a market that's in waiting mode," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. "It's waiting for a sense of what we're going to hear from companies."
Investors reviewed a handful of earnings reports Friday. Hospital operator HCA Healthcare rose 3.9 percent after the company topped estimates for the first quarter and raised its full-year profit forecast. Procter & Gamble, the maker of Charmin toilet paper and other popular consumer products, rose 3.5 percent after beating estimates thanks to price increases.
Information technology services company PC Connection fell 4.9 percent after giving investors a disappointing financial update. Regional bank Regions Financial fell 2.8 percent after reporting discouraging earnings.
Companies have so far been beating Wall Street forecasts this earnings period. Analysts had forecast this would mark the sharpest drop in S&P 500 earnings per share since the pandemic stunned the economy in 2020. Analysts polled by FactSet expect profits to contract by 6.3 percent for companies in the S&P 500.
Several big companies are on deck to report earnings next week, giving investors another heavy few days of corporate updates. Coca-Cola reports its latest results on Monday, followed by McDonald's and Alphabet on Tuesday.
Boeing and Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, will report results on Wednesday. Investors will get more details on the health of the airline industry when American Airlines and Southwest Airlines report financial results on Thursday, along with internet retail giant Amazon.
The busy week of earnings reports could help provide more direction for investors as recession worries linger, Dr. Krosby said.
"There's a tug of war between what the economic data is saying and the message from equity markets," she said.
The latest earnings come as investors worry about the potential for a recession amid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. The central bank aggressively raised interest rates through 2022 and into 2023. The rate hikes have weighed on economic growth and while inflation has eased it remains high and is still squeezing consumers.
The Fed will meet again in early May and is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by another quarter point. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will take a break from raising interest rates after that meeting.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.17 percent from 4.16 percent late Thursday.
Wall Street is anticipating more economic data next week that could provide greater insight into inflation's impact and the economy's path. The reports will included consumer confidence for April, first-quarter gross domestic product and another government update on prices and inflation.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 3.73 points to 4,133.52. The Dow added 22.34 points to close at 33,808.96. The Nasdaq rose 12.90 points to 12,072.46. Decliners held a slight edge over gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
Markets in Europe also ended with small gains Friday, while exchanges in Asia declined overnight.

With Confirmation of Chief Judge, New York's Top Court Tilts Back to the Left: [National Desk]

Full text: Judge Wilson, a prominent liberal jurist, will be the first Black judge to lead the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court.
ALBANY, N.Y. -- Judge Rowan Wilson, a liberal-leaning jurist, was confirmed as chief judge of New York State's highest court on Tuesday, making him the first Black judge to hold the post at a time when state courts are playing a crucial role in deciding questions of fundamental rights.
Judge Wilson's elevation from associate judge to chief judge of the Court of Appeals could open a new chapter for the court after the six-year tenure of Janet DiFiore, the previous chief judge, who wielded her influence to push the court to the right.
His confirmation by the State Senate in a 40-to-19 vote also marked the end of a tumultuous quarrel that had divided ruling Democrats in Albany after the upper chamber rejected Gov. Kathy Hochul's initial nominee two months ago, in an unprecedented rebuke of the governor by her own party.
In addition to deciding cases that reach the Court of Appeals, at times one of the most influential courts in the country, the chief judge administers the state's court system, with its 16,000 employees and $ 3 billion budget.
Judge Wilson's ascension to the state's most influential judicial post is the high point of a decades-long career of milestones.
In the 1990s, he became the first Black partner at one of the country's most prestigious law firms. Since 2017, he has distinguished himself as a prominent liberal voice on the Court of Appeals, where he has helped expand the rights of workers and criminal defendants, writing dozens of dissents against the court's more conservative rulings.
Judge Wilson's smooth confirmation process was an amicable resolution to a bitter clash between Ms. Hochul and Senate Democrats, who blocked her first nominee, Hector D. LaSalle, over concerns that he was too conservative.
Judge Wilson, 62, was a more amenable choice for Senate Democrats, who are intent on changing the court's political direction.
"Judge Wilson will bring honor to our court and will help lead our court in a new direction that will stand up for all New Yorkers," State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Democratic majority leader, said on the chamber floor, adding that the state court would be "crucial in securing our most basic freedoms."
Republicans cast Judge Wilson as too liberal. State Senator Anthony H. Palumbo, a Republican, said he was "an activist judge acting in a way that is contrary to common sense and the law."
The Court of Appeals could end up deciding an appeal by Democrats challenging the state's recently redrawn congressional lines, which helped Republicans recapture the House of Representatives last year. A court with a more solidly liberal majority could bolster Democrats' efforts to reconfigure the maps in their favor.
Judge Wilson will fill a position that has remained empty since Ms. DiFiore resigned seven months ago.
To replace him as an associate judge on the court, whose seven members serve 14-year terms, Ms. Hochul nominated Caitlin Halligan, a private lawyer and former state solicitor general.
Ms. Halligan, who is seen as more moderate than Judge Wilson, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a three-hour hearing on Tuesday. While both Democrats and Republicans praised her qualifications and showered her with deferential comments, her confirmation could face a hurdle.
Senate Republicans may sue over the constitutionality of the procedure Ms. Hochul used to nominate two candidates at once to the Court of Appeals. At issue is a law Ms. Hochul recently signed to speed up the process of filling a vacancy when an associate judge is elevated to chief judge.
Under that law, Ms. Hochul picked both Judge Wilson and Ms. Halligan from the same shortlist of chief judge candidates created by a special commission, avoiding a monthslong process to create a second list to fill the additional vacancy.
Government watchdogs argued the law excluded those who might not have applied to be chief judge from being considered for the associate judge role.
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans said they were still deciding whether to sue. Senate Democrats plan to hold a floor vote on Ms. Halligan on Wednesday.
Ms. Halligan's résumé has impressed lawmakers on both sides: In addition to serving as the state's solicitor general between 2001 and 2007, she was repeatedly nominated by President Barack Obama to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and she has argued six cases before the Supreme Court.
But she has not produced a substantial body of writings, and some lawmakers have struggled to pin down her political leanings as they strive to predict how she would rule on important cases. Indeed, parts of her record may appear contradictory.
As solicitor general she worked on a seminal case against the Environmental Protection Agency under the George W. Bush administration, in which the Supreme Court ruled the E.P.A. could regulate greenhouse gases.
But as a private lawyer, she represented Chevron in its litigation against the environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donzinger, who won a $ 9.5 billion case against the company for polluting the Amazon before he was disbarred.
On Tuesday, Ms. Halligan told lawmakers that her clients' views did not represent her own, encouraging lawmakers to judge her instead by her pro bono work defending tenants, workers and civil rights organizations.
"I have certainly not agreed with the positions of all of my clients, in the public or private sector," she said. "I do believe that the breadth of my experience would serve me really well if I was confirmed because it has allowed me to see a wide range of perspectives."

Supreme Court Seems Ready to Add Protections for Religious Workers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The justices searched for common ground and may be prepared to issue a modest revision to an aspect of a 1977 precedent that imposed only a slight burden on businesses.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court seemed poised on Tuesday to expand, though perhaps only slightly, religious workers' protections for refusing to work on the Sabbath.
The argument in the case, brought by a Pennsylvania postal worker who said his Christian faith did not allow him to deliver mail on Sundays, was notable for the justices' efforts to locate common ground.
"The argument has been productive in finding points of agreement," Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said.
There was, for instance, something like consensus that a phrase in Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, a key 1977 precedent, went too far in allowing employers to discriminate against religious workers. The decision said that employers need not accommodate workers if the effort imposed more than a "de minimis" burden on their businesses.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said there was general agreement that the phrase was a misstep.
"I think there's common ground, too," he said, "that de minimis can't be the test, in isolation at least, because Congress doesn't pass civil rights legislation to have de minimis effect, right? We don't think of the civil rights laws as trifling, which is the definition of de minimis."
He added, echoing an adage, "The law does not concern itself with trifles."
The Hardison decision interpreted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that requires employers to "reasonably accommodate" workers' religious practice so long as they can do so "without undue hardship" to the company's business.
Much of the argument concerned what alternative interpretation of "undue hardship" the court should offer to guide lower courts and employers.
The case was brought by Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian and former missionary who worked as a substitute mail carrier. After the U.S. Postal Service struck a deal with Amazon in 2013 to deliver packages on Sundays, Mr. Groff said he had to choose between his faith and his livelihood, opting to quit after being disciplined for missing work.
Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the Postal Service, said Mr. Groff's refusal to work on Sundays imposed a significant burden on a small post office, was in tension with an agreement with a labor union and was bad for other workers' morale.
"His absences created direct concrete burdens on other carriers who had to stay on their shifts longer to get the mail delivered," Ms. Prelogar said of Mr. Groff. "That caused problems with the timely delivery of mail, and it actually produced employee retention problems, with one carrier quitting and another carrier transferring and another carrier filing a union grievance. That is an undue hardship under any reasonable standard."
Despite occasional confusion in the lower courts, she said, the Hardison decision has been effective in protecting the rights of religious workers.
Justice Alito disagreed, pointing to supporting briefs filed in the case, Groff v. DeJoy, No. 22-174.
"We have amicus briefs here by many representatives of many minority religions -- Muslims, Hindus, Orthodox Jews, Seventh-day Adventists -- and they all say that that is just not true, and that Hardison has violated their right to religious liberty."
Aaron Streett, a lawyer for Mr. Groff, urged the court to overrule the Hardison decision and replace it with a standard borrowed from civil rights laws like the Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires employers to provide an accommodation unless it would impose significant difficulty or expense.
Under current law, Mr. Streett said, disabled and pregnant workers receive more protection than religious ones. "A diabetic employee could receive snack breaks under the A.D.A. but not prayer breaks under Title VII, he said, adding that "an employee could receive weekly leave for pregnancy checkups but not to attend Mass."
Justice Elena Kagan said that aligning the statutes was a task for Congress, not the court.
"Congress has had that opportunity to change it," she said of the Supreme Court's interpretation of Title VII. "Congress has not done so."
By the conclusion of the argument it seemed clear that Mr. Groff would emerge with a more protective legal standard. But the justices may return the case to the lower courts to apply the new standard to his case, and it was not clear that would prevail at the end of the day.
"The hard thing is how to apply it," Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said, sketching out his interpretation of "undue hardship."
"I understand that term in the original statute," he said, "to reflect a balance between two important values: one, religious liberty and the other the rights of American businesses to thrive, and to thrive, you have to be able to make money."
Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested that other employees' morale must factor into the calculus. Morale may be hard to quantify, she said, but businesses are hurt if "employees aren't as productive because they're grumbling, they're not willing to kind of go the extra mile, put their best foot forward."
Mr. Streett, the lawyer for the postal worker, said those concerns should not suffice to overcome religious accommodation. "It's not enough to have morale issues," he said. "It's not enough to just have grumbling."
Justice Gorsuch proposed that the court issue a modest decision, one that merely rejected "this de minimis language."
"Maybe we could do a good day's work and put a period at the end of it," he said, "by saying that that is not the law."

Turning Satellites To Their Advantage: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mega-constellations built by SpaceX, Amazon and other companies could carry thousands of sensors that could aid research into gamma rays, space weather and other subjects.
Each night, the stars of the sky compete with thousands of satellites. The number of intruders is only growing as constellations of satellites proliferate, with companies planning to launch orbiters by the tens of thousands to transmit internet and other communications signals back to Earth. Among them are SpaceX, which has already launched thousands of Starlink satellites, and Amazon, which plans to begin its Project Kuiper constellation later this year.
For astronomers studying the universe from the surface of our world, this is a mounting problem.
"It's a hot topic," said Eric Burns, an astronomer at Louisiana State University. "We're dealing with numbers of satellites so great that they are limiting the sensitivity of ground-based telescopes."
Many astronomers have lodged strong criticisms of the current and future effects of satellite constellations on their studies. But Dr. Burns and other scientists are thinking about making cosmic lemonade out of orbital lemons. What if, they ask, all those interfering satellites could help advance the field of astronomy as they expand access on the ground to satellite signals?
What these astronomers see is the potential for a new type of telescope that mega-constellations could provide. In a forthcoming proposal that Dr. Burns and his colleagues intend to share with private companies building satellite constellations, they hope that thousands of tiny gamma-ray detectors can hitch a ride into space with the satellites. Taken alone, each individual detector would be weak. But operating together inside a mega-constellation of many thousands of satellites, the power of such a system would rival Swift and Fermi, two gamma-ray observatories in space that are managed by NASA.
The impact would be significant. Gamma-ray bursts are the hallmark of the universe's most catastrophic events since the Big Bang. Deepening research into the phenomena could help answer today's grandest questions, such as what makes up the cores of neutron stars or how the behavior of dark energy could reveal the shape of the universe.
"These are about as important a set of questions as can be asked in astronomy," Dr. Burns said. "We will be able to treat the thousands of gamma-ray detectors as a single, extremely powerful coherent telescope looking all over the universe, which would be more sensitive than anything done before."
The idea is not without precedent. In 2011, Iridium Communications worked with scientists to piggyback research instruments into space. Around 30 Iridium satellites -- which typically beam voice and data communications down to Earth -- also host dosimeters that measure radiation in low Earth orbit under the REACH program, a collaboration between the United States Air Force and scientists.
And all of Iridium's 60-plus satellites carry magnetometers for the AMPERE program, run by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, which studies how energy enters the Earth's ionosphere from its magnetosphere.
Alexa Halford, an associate lab chief at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, says the Iridium readings are an important source of radiation data. Her work uncovers the connection between Earth's magnetosphere and its atmosphere and how the two work together to shield the ground from showers of strong radiation from space.
Dr. Halford said that the ways in which satellite mega-constellations interfere with telescopes on Earth's surface needed more consideration.
"Ground-based astronomy is incredibly important, and we need to be responsible," she said.
On the other hand, she sees great potential from putting scientific instruments on more satellites.
"More data can give us a more complete picture," Dr. Halford said. "I'd have a hard time saying no."
SpaceX is already sharing some data with scientists in an arrangement that could benefit both parties.
Tzu-Wei Fang, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who specializes in predicting space weather, began collaborating with SpaceX after a disastrous launch in February 2022. SpaceX watched as 38 of its 49 newly deployed Starlink satellites burst into flames.
Dr. Fang's post-mortem documented how a minor geomagnetic storm had raised the density of the air at the altitudes where low-Earth orbits take place. So instead of sailing into orbit, the Starlink satellites smacked into dense, hot air and broke apart.
"No one can do low-Earth orbit drag very well right now because we don't have the right satellites," she said.
After that incident, SpaceX agreed to share the positioning and velocity data for its approximately 4,000 Starlink satellites for a year, giving Dr. Fang and her colleagues the opportunity to study the type of orbital drag that had destroyed the satellites. That could potentially lead to better space weather predictions, giving satellites more time to react to a surge in air density by rising to a safer orbital altitude, "which will ultimately benefit everybody," Dr. Fang said.
Getting scientifically useful data from satellite constellations presents technical hurdles. Satellites in low-Earth orbit move very fast, completing an entire orbital circuit in around 90 minutes. So combining data from a constellation of many satellites isn't easy.
And in order for scientific equipment to ride along into orbit, there are strict limitations. Low-Earth-orbit communications satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink, have short life spans of about five years, so the detectors would have to be inexpensive. By contrast, the Hubble Space Telescope cost around $ 16 billion in today's dollars but is expected to last around 40 years.
Any additions couldn't just be tacked on at the last minute. Satellite engineers would need to modify their designs to accommodate the new payloads with upgrades such as bigger power sources and data links.
None of the companies that are building enormous satellite constellations have said they would be willing to deploy gamma-ray detectors or other new sensors that would help scientists. When asked for comment on the idea, SpaceX declined to reply, and OneWeb, which recently completed another, smaller constellation, never responded. Project Kuiper, the constellation from the online retailer Amazon that may launch its first satellites later this year, said it had invited Dr. Burns to submit his proposal.
Dr. Halford suggested that increasing the number of partnerships with the constellation operators was a way to benefit everyone without cluttering the sky even further. "That's not a great answer, but I think it's the best we have," she said.
So far, the burden of individually negotiating with hesitant companies like SpaceX has frustrated astronomers. Dr. Burns thinks it might be time for government oversight to ensure minimal harm to science from mega-constellations.
With greater participation, Dr. Burns hopes scientists and satellite makers can learn to work together. "I do think this idea of science instruments on the mega-constellations themselves would be a benefit on both sides," he said. "If they're open to it, it's an even greater solution."

Writers Guild Approves Strike as Shutdown Looms: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The writers have not gone on strike in 15 years, and the vote gives their unions the right to call for a walkout when their contract expires on May 1.
Hollywood is getting ever closer to a shutdown.
The unions representing thousands of television and movie writers said on Monday that they had overwhelming support for a strike, giving union leaders the right to call for a walkout when the writers' contract with the major Hollywood studios expires on May 1.
The unions, which are affiliated East and West Coast branches of the Writers Guild of America, said more than 9,000 writers had approved a strike authorization, with 98 percent of the vote.
W.G.A. leaders have said this is an "existential" moment for writers, contending that compensation has stagnated over the last decade despite the explosion of television series in the streaming era. In an email last week to writers, the lead negotiators said that "the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation."
With two weeks to go before the contract expires, there has been little sign of progress in the talks. In the email, the negotiating committee said the studios "have failed to offer meaningful responses on the core economic issues" and offered only small concessions in a few areas.
"In short, the studios have shown no sign that they intend to address the problems our members are determined to fix in this negotiation," the email said.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood production companies, said in a statement that a strike authorization "should come as no surprise to anyone."
"A strike authorization vote has always been part of the W.G.A.'s plan, announced before the parties even exchanged proposals," the statement said. "Our goal is, and continues to be, to reach a fair and reasonable agreement." It added, "An agreement is only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining by engaging in full discussions of the issues with the companies and searching for reasonable compromises."
In recent weeks, Hollywood executives have begun preparing for a strike, both by stockpiling scripts and by getting ready to produce a torrent of reality series, which do not need script writers. David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns the Warner Bros. film and TV studios as well as HBO, said at a news media event last week that he was hopeful a deal would be reached. He added that "a strike will be a challenge for the whole industry."
Still, he said, the company was fully prepared if there was a walkout.
"We're assuming the worst from a business perspective," he said. "We've got ourselves ready. We've had a lot of content that's been produced."
A strike authorization does not guarantee writers will take to the picket lines in two weeks. In 2017, a last-minute deal was struck with the studios not long after 96 percent of the writers voted to authorize a strike. The last time the writers went on strike was in 2007. That stoppage dragged for 100 days, into early 2008, and cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $ 2.1 billion.
If a strike begins in early May, late-night shows like "Saturday Night Live" and talk shows hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers will go dark immediately. It would take a strike of several months before viewers began to notice an effect on scripted television series and movies.
The streaming era has resulted in a significant rise in the number of scripted television series that are produced, but writers say working conditions have not kept pace.
"Writers are working more weeks for less money," said Eric Haywood, a veteran writer and producer, and a member of the W.G.A. negotiating committee. "And in some cases, veteran writers are working for the same money or, in some cases, less money than they made just a few years ago."
The timing of the talks has an added complexity given the current financial challenges for all media and entertainment companies.
Over the last year, share prices for those companies have nose-dived after Wall Street began questioning why many streaming services were losing billions of dollars a year. The studios are quickly trying to make those streaming services profitable, after years of focusing primarily on growth. The shift is coming at a cost.
Disney is in the midst of 7,000 job cuts. Warner Bros. Discovery, confronting a debt load of about $ 50 billion, shelved projects and laid off thousands of workers last year. Other media companies are taking similar cost-cutting measures.
The writers do not appear to be sympathetic.
"The current status quo is unsustainable," Mr. Haywood said.
The writers have taken particular aim at so-called minirooms. There is no one definition of a miniroom, but they have proliferated in the streaming era.
In one example, the studios will convene a miniroom before a show has been picked up by a studio and scheduled to air. A small group of writers will develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months.
But because the studios have not ordered the series, they will use that as justification to pay writers less than if they were in a formal writers' room, union leaders said. And given the relatively short duration of the position, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up.
One union leader likened minirooms to "labor camps" during the negotiations, according to two people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
A W.G.A. spokesman said the reference was not literal and had come during a presentation lasting an hour and a half.
"Development work has always been paid at a premium because you're coming up with the idea," Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the W.G.A., said in an interview. "If you're going to have these rooms before you pick up a show or a season, you should pay writers a premium."
The writers have also said residuals -- which Ms. Stutzman called "the profit participation of the middle-class writer" -- have been affected in the streaming era. Before streaming, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales.
But in the streaming era, as global services like Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off and replaced with a fixed residual, Ms. Stutzman said.
"If an overwhelming majority of the content writers create is for the streaming platforms where they are completely cut out of global growth and success, that is a very big problem," she said.

LANCASTER, Pa. — On a blustery morning last month, Gerald Groff drove through rolling farmland in Amish country, slowing to pass the occasional horse-drawn buggy and pointing out some of the hundreds of mailboxes that used to mark his postal route.
Groff, a soft-spoken evangelical Christian and former missionary, said that delivering the mail was an arduous but noble calling. “Remember that this started with the Pony Express,” he said. “It’s written in the Constitution.”
But after the U.S. Postal Service struck a deal with Amazon in 2013 to deliver packages on Sundays, Groff said he faced a choice: to work on his Sabbath or lose his livelihood. “I’m put into a situation where I have to choose to honor my earthly authority or do what I know is right to honor God,” he said. “I have to choose God.”
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the Postal Service should have done more for Groff under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that requires employers to “reasonably accommodate” workers’ religious practice so long as they can do so “without undue hardship” to the company’s business.
The Supreme Court has lately been exceptionally receptive to claims of religious discrimination, largely from Christians, meaning that Groff’s prospects are good. A ruling in his favor would extend a remarkable run of decisions chipping away at the wall between church and state and expanding the role of religion in public life, sometimes at the expense of other values, like gay rights and access to contraception.
Groff’s case has the potential to affect countless workplaces and could require many employers to make major changes to accommodate religious workers. But a decision in his favor may be less contentious than some of the court’s recent rulings on religion, in part because protecting the Sabbath may not divide Americans along the usual fault lines. Indeed, liberal justices have been at the forefront of efforts to shield workers from discipline and termination for following their faith.
Rachel Laser, the president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the case is “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”
“Our civil rights laws rightly require religious accommodations for workers, which is especially important for religious minorities whose rights and customs might not be respected in the workplace,” she said. “But religious freedom does not mean we can shift the burden of practicing our faith onto other people. Religious freedom has never been a license to harm others, in employment or any other facet of life.”
Groff, 45, said his request was both modest and important.
“Sunday’s a day where we get together and almost taste heaven,” he said. “We come together as believers. We celebrate who we are, together. We worship God. And so to be asked to deliver Amazon parcels and give all that up, it’s just really kind of sad.”
In the last few years, the Supreme Court has ruled that a high school football coach had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team’s games, that state programs supporting private schools in Maine and Montana must include religious ones, that a Catholic social services agency in Philadelphia could defy city rules and refuse to work with same-sex couples who apply to take in foster children and that the Trump administration could allow employers with religious objections to deny contraception coverage to female workers.
The court’s three most conservative members — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — have already indicated that they may be prepared to overrule the key precedent in Groff’s case, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison. In that 1977 decision, the Supreme Court defined “undue hardship” narrowly, ruling that it applied to any accommodation that imposed more than a small, or “de minimis,” cost on the employer.
Groff’s superiors noted that his job, as a rural carrier associate, was to substitute for full-time workers and that he knew from the outset that it required flexibility and weekend work.
That did not pose a problem before the Amazon deal, as the post office had generally never delivered mail on Sundays. After the deal, Groff’s bosses made some accommodations but contended that allowing him to skip work on all Sundays was a significant burden, in tension with an agreement with a labor union and bad for other workers’ morale.
Over time, they disciplined him for failing to report for Sunday deliveries, and in 2019 he quit.
“I really didn’t want a federal termination to follow me the rest of my life,” Groff said. “So I went ahead and submitted a resignation because the harassment on a daily basis just got to the point where I couldn’t handle it anymore.”
He sued under the Civil Rights Act, and lower courts ruled against him. Judge Patty Shwartz, writing for a divided three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, said that “exempting Groff from working on Sundays caused more than a de minimis cost on U.S.P.S. because it actually imposed on his co-workers, disrupted the workplace and work flow, and diminished employee morale.”
In dissent, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman wrote that “the majority renders any burden on employees sufficient to establish undue hardship, effectively subjecting Title VII religious accommodation to a heckler’s veto by disgruntled employees.”
Much has changed since the Supreme Court’s decision in the Hardison case in 1977, when religious liberty was largely a liberal cause and when the typical plaintiff was a member of a religious minority. In the Hardison case, involving an adherent of the Worldwide Church of God who wanted to observe a Saturday Sabbath, the two dissenting justices were liberal lions.
Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., wrote that the “de minimis” standard adopted by the majority “makes a mockery of the statute,” adding that plain English did not support that interpretation of the phrase “undue hardship.”
The sums at issue in 1977 were “far from staggering: $150 for three months,” Marshall wrote, adding: “To conclude that TWA, one of the largest air carriers in the nation, would have suffered undue hardship had it done anything more defies both reason and common sense.”
He called on the court to reverse course. “All Americans will be a little poorer until today’s decision is erased,” he wrote.
Groff is represented by First Liberty Institute, which says it is the largest legal organization in the nation focused exclusively on defending religious freedom. The group’s Supreme Court brief urged the justices to give the statutory “undue hardship” standard more bite.
The brief suggested borrowing a test used in cases under civil rights laws like the Americans With Disabilities Act, one that requires employers to provide an accommodation unless it would impose significant difficulty or expense considering the employer’s resources, the number of people who work for it and the nature of its business.
The Biden administration, representing the Postal Service, walked a fine line in its own Supreme Court brief in the case, Groff v. DeJoy, No. 22-174, saying that the court should stop short of overruling Hardison “while also clarifying and reinforcing its limits.”
The right place to draw the line, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar wrote, was to say that employers need not operate short-handed or regularly pay overtime to replacement workers but must bear more modest costs like occasional overtime or the expenses associated with rearranging schedules.
Allowing Groff to observe the Sabbath would impose excessive costs, Prelogar added, saying that even the accommodations the Postal Service had made “actually contributed to other employees quitting or transferring.”
The Postal Service “has suffered substantial losses for many years,” she wrote, and the Amazon deal was critically important.
Groff, showing a visitor the post office where he used to work, said there must be a middle ground. He added that he missed his old job.
“I loved it,” he said. “I planned to make a career of it.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His newspaper, the East Village Eye, was as scrappy and iconoclastic as the young maverick stars its pages brought to life.
Leonard Abrams, the founder of the East Village Eye, a community newspaper dripping with attitude that captured in newsprint the do-it-yourself post-punk ethos that ignited the explosion of groundbreaking art, music and fashion in downtown Manhattan in the 1980s, died on April 1 in New Jersey. He was 68.
The cause was a heart attack at a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike on his way home to Queens from a business trip, said Arthur Fournier, a close friend and longtime colleague.
The Eye, a monthly publication that Mr. Abrams published and edited from 1979 to 1987, scarcely made a dent above 14th Street in Manhattan -- to many the traditional dividing line of "downtown." But to those who lived a short stroll from Tompkins Square Park, it functioned as a house organ for the graffiti artists, New Wave (and No Wave) bands and maverick fashion designers who came together in the 1980s to create one of New York's storied cultural flowerings.
"There were performances, there was art, there was rock 'n' roll, and people were just showing up and meeting each other," Mr. Abrams recalled in a 2005 interview with the website Gothamist. "These people who would work together, party together, have sex or maybe be at each other's throats were all just getting together and forming the East Village scene."
In an era of affordable railroad apartments and storefront gallery spaces, the Eye chronicled the doings and musings of era-defining stars like Keith Haring and Barbara Kruger, musicians like Iggy Pop and the Beastie Boys, and fashion designers like Patricia Field and Betsey Johnson. The punk savant Richard Hell cataloged his thoughts on music and bohemian culture in a column called "Slum Journal." Glenn O'Brien, a former editor of Interview magazine, opined on the New York sports landscape.
Despite its downtown focus, the Eye also cast a glance uptown and beyond to chronicle the world of hip-hop as it hurtled toward the mainstream. It ran early feature articles about Afrika Bambaataa, Run-DMC and the graffiti artist Fab 5 Freddy.
Indeed, Mr. Abrams and others associated with the Eye long claimed that it was the first publication to print a comprehensive definition of hip-hop, with a parenthetical in a January 1982 interview with Mr. Bambaataa by the writer Michael Holman that summarized the term as "the all-inclusive tag for the rapping, breaking, graffiti-writing, crew-fashion-wearing street subculture."
In 1987, Mr. Abrams emerged from his editor's desk to oversee an influential regular hip-hop party on the Lower East Side called Hotel Amazon, featuring performances by up-and-coming acts like De La Soul, Queen Latifah and A Tribe Called Quest, as well as more established acts like Public Enemy.
"Dude did a lot to make NYC move and think," Chuck D, the frontman of Public Enemy, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. In 2008, Chuck D narrated "Quilombo Country," a documentary written and directed by Mr. Abrams about the continuing struggles of villages in Brazil that had been founded by fugitive slaves.
The Eye, which found a national and even international readership, functioned both to feed and to deflate the swelling mythology surrounding the scene. "If all the hype and nonsense theories I've heard about the East Village were one big throat," the celebrated artist (and occasional Eye contributor) David Wojnarowicz said in a 1984 interview with the newspaper, "I'd volunteer to strangle it."
Mr. Abrams was born on Dec. 19, 1954, in Brooklyn, the youngest of four children of Nathan Abrams, a furrier who later became a securities trader, and Adele (Fleischman) Abrams, a bank executive.
In 1976, after studying literature at Fordham University, Mr. Abrams got a job as a bicycle messenger and moved to the East Village, a gritty neighborhood still filled with bargain apartments. "It took me two days a month -- as a bicycle messenger -- to pay my share of the rent on my apartment," he said in a recent interview on the podcast "FAQ NYC."
He moved to Colorado for a while, but he returned to New York on New Year's Day 1979 and discovered a creative outpouring that seemed to beg for its own publication. Before long, the Eye was chronicling the misfits and geniuses -- often one and the same -- who were making the neighborhood a creative cauldron.
Michael Musto, the longtime Village Voice columnist and downtown fixture, recalled in an email, "In the Eye, you could read about iconoclastic performers like Diamanda Galás or Kembra Pfahler, funky boutiques like Manic Panic and Patricia Field, or quirky clubs and spaces like King Tut's Wah Wah Hut and 8 BC."
But Mr. Abrams was no cheerleader. Under his watch, the Eye chronicled the ravages of crack cocaine, the devastation of AIDS and the rising tide of gentrification, all of which would ultimately help splinter the scene.
The Eye peaked in influence in the early 1980s, Mr. Musto said, filling a relative gap between the '70s heyday of the Soho Weekly News, which shuttered in 1982, and the rise of the original Details magazine, which started that same year and covered the same general turf, but with a glossier approach.
Within five years, however, Mr. Abrams had shut down the paper, wearied by the grind, the soaring real estate values that were pushing out the hungry young artists, and the lack of revenue for the paper, which even in good times had only enough money to pay a few staff members, Mr. Fournier said.
Mr. Abrams is survived by his brother, Lawrence; his sisters, Debbie King and Bethany Haye; and his partner, Angela Sloan.
Following the demise of the Eye, Mr. Abrams poured his energies into his club, his documentary and, in later years, a business importing religious products from Mexico. For decades, the legacy of the Eye was largely kept alive in the yellowing copies that Mr. Abrams kept in a storage locker in Queens. That changed in November, when the New York Public Library added those 72 issues to its archive, the culmination of a long campaign by Mr. Abrams and Mr. Fournier.
In an article in The New Yorker in February about the library's acquisition, Mr. Abrams, unassuming in most circumstances, allowed himself a rare moment of self-approbation.
"I had a nose for news," he said, "and the news I had a nose for was 10 years ahead."

Is Israeli Public Television The Right's Next Target?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When you host one of the world's last over-the-air radio shows in Yiddish, fans occasionally get in touch. But you hear more often from critics. They write to Avraham Zaks, the 37-year-old behind the mic of a weekly program called "We Are Here!" to nitpick about his grammar. Or to complain about his accent, which doesn't sound sufficiently Eastern European to their ears. Some tell him the show needs more religious content.
Mr. Zaks, who has flecks of gray in his beard and warm dark eyes and wears wire-rim glasses, does not mind. On some level, he is kind of tickled by the feedback.
"I write and say: 'Thank you very much, we're doing our best. It's nice to hear that you're listening,"' he said on a Wednesday afternoon, just minutes before his show started. "The problem in broadcasting generally is that most of the time, you don't get any reaction. You feel like you're speaking to yourself."
"We Are Here!" is one of a handful of niche language radio offerings of Kan, Israel's public media network, officially known as the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation.
Most of the company's 1,000 employees run a highly regarded TV, radio and digital news division or oversee the production of some of the country's most prestigious television shows, some of which air on U.S. streaming platforms. As Israel's answer to the BBC or PBS, Kan, whose headquarters is in Jerusalem, is more interested in gravity than ratings.
These days, Kan has a new focus: survival. It sits squarely in the cross hairs of Israel's right-wing government elected in November. Through Shlomo Karhi, the minister of communications, the government has issued a number of threats against the network, starting with a vow to defund the company and shut it down.
"There is no place in this day and age for a public broadcaster when there is a wide range of channels," Mr. Karhi said during a news conference in January.
In case anyone thought he was talking exclusively about saving taxpayer money -- Kan receives the equivalent of $ 180 million a year from Israel's coffers, about 85 percent of the company's budget -- he also accused the media more broadly of being "too biased toward the left."
A few weeks later, a spokesman for Mr. Karhi said in a statement that the closure of Kan was delayed "until further notice" so that the government could concentrate on overhauling the judiciary, a plan that has convulsed the nation.
More recently, the minister said he wanted to strip Kan of three of its eight radio spectrums, which are needed for radio stations. The station broadcasting "We Are Here!" is expected to survive any cull because an Israeli regulation requires foreign language broadcasting in this nation of immigrants.
The fear among Kan's supporters is that once the government is done with the judiciary overhaul, whether its plans end with success or failure, the network is next.
"If you're looking for a textbook on how to turn a democracy into an autocracy, it includes shutting down independent media," said Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, who drafted Kan's journalistic code of ethics.
The media market in Israel, a country of 10 million people, is small by American standards and highly competitive. There are four TV networks in total. The other three are privately held and Kan is generally in a tie for fourth place in the ratings race with Channel 14. That network, often called Israel's version of Fox News, enthusiastically supports the Netanyahu administration. In recent months, according to the network, it has enjoyed a ratings surge.
Political leaders in Israel, like those in virtually every country, try to influence and shape news coverage. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems especially eager to manage the media. Two of the three corruption trials against him involve quid pro quos for favorable coverage from powerful publishers -- one the owner of a large daily newspaper and the other a telecom tycoon who operates a popular online news site. (Mr. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.)
"The coalition is not interested in the standard pushback game we've seen in the past," said Shuki Tausig, chief editor of The Seventh Eye, a media watchdog publication. "They want to use regulations to weaken, or even smash, big commercial players that are not obeying them. And they want to eliminate or control Kan."
The network is the successor to the Israel Broadcasting Authority, which was closed in 2017 after critics from across the political spectrum concluded that its programming was shabby and the authority too easily buffeted by politicians, who appointed its board members and controlled its budget.
Kan has been designed for imperviousness to partisanship, relatively speaking; the job of selecting board members is up to industry professionals. It's a structure that has produced a catalog of highly compelling television, including a three-part documentary about Adolph Eichmann, "The Devil's Confession," available on Amazon Prime and bankrolled by a number of companies. Last month, Kan was nominated for 125 Ophir Awards, Israel's version of the Oscars and Emmys, more than double its nearest rival.
"All the other networks are trying to make a profit so they are filled with shows where people are on an island for three weeks fighting over a bag of rice," said Tsuriel Rashi, senior lecturer at Ariel University's School of Communication. The Eichmann documentary, he added, was "a huge undertaking."
"It's expensive, and it won't make money," he said, "but it's important."
Kan is in an office building in a generic patch in Jerusalem, not far from an ultra Orthodox neighborhood and near the Israel Tax Authority. During a recent visit, the place hummed with reporters readying an evening broadcast. In the Arab media room, a handful of employees were watching dozens of televisions broadcasting from around the Middle East.
"Today is kind of quiet," said a reporter with his eyes trained on the screens. "There was a machine gun fired into the air in Gaza, which set off sirens in Israel, but no rockets."
"I've seen scarier things in my professional life," one of his colleagues said.
Despite the business-as-usual vibe here, morale has sagged, as it would at any institution facing extinction.
"We had a companywide meeting a few weeks ago, and I told everyone, 'I know there are people here who go home at night and have children ask if they will have a job in the morning,"' Gil Omer, chairman of the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, said in an interview at Kan's offices. "And I told them that we will do everything we can to keep this place alive."
For now, the government appears to have scaled back its ambitions to those three radio spectrums, which it plans to make available to commercial networks.
It's not a measure Mr. Karhi could take unilaterally. Yoaz Hendel, his predecessor as minister of communications, said in an interview that Mr. Karhi did not seem to understand the job, which has nothing to do with Kan's budget -- that's the finance ministry's purview -- and is all about building communications infrastructure, like 5G.
"Karhi could announce tomorrow that all Israelis need to wear red hats, but that doesn't mean anyone would listen to him," Mr. Hendel said. "He should focus on what he was appointed to do, which is to make sure that Israel is well-connected."
Elad Malka, the vice director general at the Ministry of Communications, disagreed. "The minister in charge of public broadcasting is the minister of communications," he said. "Of course, if there are changes that the minister wants, he needs to go to the Knesset," Mr. Malka added, referring to Israel's Parliament.
Even if he lacks the authority to unplug Kan on his own, Mr. Karhi, a former member of the Knesset, has grabbed national attention in Israel because his statements appear to reflect the will of the government. And grabbing attention is one of Mr. Karhi's specialties.
In February, he denounced critics of the judicial overhaul plan as "erav rav," an ancient term for demons who pose as Jews and must be killed. In early March, during the Jewish holiday of Purim, he tweeted a message wishing everyone well -- except for reservists soldiers opposed to the judicial overhaul, who he said could "go to hell."
"He has no interest in media," Mr. Tausig said. "His actions as minister are just political opportunism, a way to demonstrate he's more extreme than extreme, to serve Netanyahu."
A spokesman for the Ministry of Communications declined to comment.
Mr. Zaks, the host of "We Are Here!," has closely followed the drama that has engulfed his employer, but one recent Wednesday afternoon he was more interested on his upcoming interview with the head of the Yiddish Department at Hebrew University.
They discussed how to attract Israel's ultra Orthodox to evenings of Yiddish theater and literature, a major challenge given that much of the canon is downright irreligious. Reaching the Haredi, or ultra Orthodox, community is important to Mr. Zaks, who was raised in a Lubavitcher community outside Tel Aviv. By the time he was 20, he realized that he was an atheist and left. He spent the next few years discovering popular culture that he had never encountered -- television, movies, professional sports.
"I knew about radio because it was on all day at home," he said. "That was it."
The biggest group of Yiddish speakers in Israel are Haredi, but he assumes they are a tiny percent of the audience for "We Are Here!" because it's a secular show. He knows, however, that every year a few thousand exit the ultra Orthodox community and he's happy to offer them some connection to the world they have left behind.
"It's like being an émigré and reading a newspaper in the language you were raised in," he said. "I don't love the place that I left, but I love Yiddish. It's a heritage that we have to keep."

Wall Street Gets Hot as Inflation Cools: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Wall Street rally on Thursday lifted stocks to their highest level in almost two months following the latest sign that inflation continues to cool.
The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent after a report showed inflation at the wholesale level slowed last month by more than expected. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 2 percent.
Thursday's report showed that prices paid to producers last month were 2.7 percent higher than a year earlier, the lowest inflation level in that sector in more than two years. A day earlier, a separate report said inflation for consumers slowed to 5 percent.
Inflation and how high the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to tame it have been at the center of Wall Street's struggles for more than a year. The Fed has hiked rates at such a feverish pace that it's already slowed parts of the economy and caused strains in the banking system.
A separate report Thursday said slightly more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, though the job market has remained resilient. A softening job market could take more pressure off inflation. That, plus the inflation report, underscored traders' expectations that the end is near for the Fed's rate increases.
Traders shaded some bets toward the Fed holding rates steady at its next meeting in May, though the majority still call for one more modest hike.
A less aggressive Fed would help Big Tech stocks because high-growth stocks are seen as some of the most vulnerable to higher rates. Apple climbed 3.4 percent and Amazon jumped 4.7 percent. The pair were two of the biggest forces lifting the S&P 500.
The Fed has raised rates at every one of its meetings since early last year, often by double or triple the usual amount. High rates can smother inflation but only by slowing the entire economy, raising the risk of a recession and hurting prices for investments.
High interest rates and still-high inflation are eating away at corporate profits, and the biggest U.S. companies are starting to tell investors how much they earned during the first three months of the year. Expectations are low, with forecasts calling for the sharpest drop in earnings since the pandemic was pummeling the economy in 2020.
Delta Air Lines slid 1.1 percent after reporting weaker results for the latest quarter than expected. Delta also said customers still want to fly despite all the economy's challenges and predicted a bigger-than-expected profit for the second quarter.
Investors are likely to focus more on such forecasts than on the backwards-looking results of the last three months. Even though forecasts for 2023 earnings have come down a bit, "2023 consensus still looks optimistic if we are headed to a recession," the equity strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
Several of the biggest banks will report their results Friday, offering potentially more clues. One of the fears on Wall Street is that recent turmoil in the banking system could cause a pullback in lending, which in turn could weaken the economy. The Fed's staff economists see such weakness potentially causing a mild recession later this year, the central bank said Wednesday.
The bond market has shown much more worry about a possible recession than the stock market, with traders betting the Fed will have to cut interest rates later this year in order to prop up the economy.
Treasury yields fell immediately after Thursday's weaker-than-expected reports, before paring their losses and reversing through the morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.45 percent. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, held steady at 3.97 percent.

Full text: DSTLRY hopes to improve the treatment of creators in the industry by offering an opportunity to reap the benefits of their characters and content.
Creators of comic books are "famous for being mistreated by publishers," said David Steinberger, a co-founder and the chief executive of DSTLRY, a new company that wants to give writers and artists a greater stake for their creative efforts.
Comic book characters can be lucrative intellectual properties, particularly when they make the leap from the printed page to the silver screen, but they primarily benefit the companies that own them. It is a rueful tradition that goes back to the earliest days of the industry. The creators of Superman sold their rights to the Man of Steel for $ 130 in 1938, the year he debuted, not knowing the global recognition and longevity he would gain.
Unlike the creators of Superman, the founding creators of DSTLRY will retain ownership of their characters and concepts, as well as have an equity stake in the company. DSTLRY will produce oversize print comics as well as collectibles, including vinyl figures and posters. The publisher will also offer comics digitally -- but only for a limited time. Once the sales window closes, the digital copies will be available only in a virtual marketplace for collectors. The seller will set the price, and a portion of resales will go to the creators.
"The main drive here is to create a more sustainable and equitable future for creators," said Chip Mosher, the other co-founder of DSTLRY and its chief creative officer. "That's our macro goal -- benefiting the creators, and in turn benefiting readers and retailers."
Publishing models for comic books are on a spectrum. On one side, the company is king: DC and Marvel Comics reap the primary benefits of the success of flagship characters like Batman and Captain America, which earn millions annually for their publishers.
On the other end are publishers like Image Comics, which have a creator-owned model. Image published "The Walking Dead," which was a financial windfall for its creator, Robert Kirkman. In between there are many companies that will take a chance on new properties but usually for a share of the intellectual property rights. Comics creators for AWA, which was established in 2019, received stock in that publisher.
The initial comic book creators for DSTLRY are a murderers' row of talent. They include the writers Brian Azzarello, Scott Snyder, James Tynion IV and Ram V and the artists Mirka Andolfo, Elsa Charretier, Lee Garbett, Jock and Jamie McKelvie. (The full list of founding creators is online.)
Another creator recruited for the company is Tula Lotay, the founder of the Thought Bubble Comic Art Festival in Yorkshire, a county in northern England. Ms. Lotay, who will draw and write stories for DSTLRY, said the opportunity excited her.
"We literally co-own the publishing company, which is amazing," she said. "Aside from that, I know Chip and David know my body of work and trust what I'm doing, and so it feels like I have absolute freedom to be as creative as I want to be."
The first comic from DSTLRY is "The Devil's Cut," which will have self-contained stories by most of the founding creators. It will be available at comic book stores around the country and in time for Comic-Con International, the pop culture festival planned for July 20-23 in San Diego.
The DSTLRY founders are no strangers to working together. In 2007, Mr. Steinberger founded Comixology, a digital comics distributor that Amazon acquired in 2014. Mr. Mosher was the head of content for Comixology.
"We are really honored by the founding creators' faith in us and their good will and the good will that is out there for doing something like this," Mr. Mosher said.

Popular Demand or Influencer Appropriation?: [Style Desk]

Full text: When bottles of a hair-care product favored by Black women started getting harder to find, all eyes turned to the influencers.
When vials of Mielle Organics' rosemary-mint hair oil started disappearing from store shelves this year, Black women who had come to rely on the product were appalled.
Social media sleuths quickly found that in December, the influencer Alix Earle had shared with her nearly five million followers on TikTok that she had experienced "tremendous hair growth" while using the oil. Joining a wave of other influencers who had also started to endorse the product, Ms. Earle, who is white, added it to her Amazon storefront, where she earns a commission when her followers buy the items that she recommends.
In post after post on social media, Black women lamented that all this attention did not bode well for their favorite product. In their view, an oil that they felt had been created specifically for their hair, when relatively few products are, had been hijacked by non-Black consumers. (Ms. Earle did not respond to requests for an interview.)
"At one point, it was sold out at every single Target in New Hampshire," said Ronelle Tshiela, 23, a law student at the University of New Hampshire, who had used the oil for several years. "I was frustrated because as a Black woman, there's not that many options to begin with. The natural and ethnic hair care aisle is very limited."
Even in a multibillion-dollar industry, there are many hair-care manufacturers with few offerings specifically formulated for Black hair, if any at all. In that vacuum, Black-owned hair care companies like Mielle Organics are capitalizing on the opportunity and expanding.
With Black consumers consistently spending a substantial portion of their income on beauty products that are targeted specifically for their hair, the companies that manufacture those products are able to build a loyal consumer base, as Mielle Organics has.
The company, which started out with a focus on natural hair, has never designated a specific race that can or cannot use their products, according to Monique Rodriguez, 39, who founded Mielle Organics in 2014.
"I get and understand the frustration of Black women and why they want to protect an item," Ms. Rodriguez said in a recent interview. "I think that everyone should be able to use whatever product they choose to use if it works for their hair. I'm not going to discriminate against what race should use it."
Ten years ago, when Ms. Rodriguez began experimenting with different food products to concoct hair conditioners for her own "severely" heat-damaged hair, she was looking for something that was not yet available in the small "ethnic hair care" sections in stores, she said.
She began sharing her experiments on natural-hair forums, where she found that other women were looking for similar products as well.
"I would share different tips and educational content that was helping my hair, and I saw that it was helping a lot of other women that were dealing with different hair challenges," Ms. Rodriguez said.
She quickly became an influencer in the natural hair orbit. Soon, she said, women in the natural-hair forums started to ask where they could buy her creations. Ms. Rodriguez, who had been working as a registered nurse for 10 years by that time, decided to marry her science background with her passion for beauty products and create Mielle Organics (pronounced my-ELLE).
"I had the light-bulb moment, and I decided that I would take it seriously and create products that I felt were natural and affordable for our consumers," Ms. Rodriguez said. "I saw an unmet need in the market. I saw that there was a void, a lack of availability, education and product accessibility."
It was that void that pushed Ms. Tshiela, the law student, to create a video in response to Mielle's hair growth oil becoming a social media trend. The video met a chilly reception on Twitter and TikTok, where many users told her that she was overreacting, she recalled.
"The history of Black hair in this country refutes the claim that it's just hair or it's just hair-care products," Ms. Tshiela said. "There is legislation that has moved through Congress to protect natural hair, to protect protective hairstyles. So when people say it's just hair, they're just hair products, it doesn't make sense because it doesn't match reality."
The potential of Black hair care companies has caught the attention of the consumer-goods giant Procter & Gamble, which announced in January that it had bought Mielle Organics. The company now operates as an independent subsidiary within P&G Beauty, with Ms. Rodriguez and her husband, Melvin, serving as chief executive and chief operating officer.
Ms. Rodriguez said she hoped that working with Procter & Gamble would help allay customers' anxieties about the availability of Mielle products.
"P&G will act as a resource to help us scale and increase our product distribution," Ms. Rodriguez said. "We will be able to have more access to African American communities and will have the ability to innovate faster."
For consumers like Ms. Tshiela, greater availability can make a real difference in a space where social media trends can move the needle on consumer behavior in ways that are hard to predict.
"The people who actually need these products, the people who don't have anywhere else to turn, are unable to access these products, because of overconsumption and because of the influencer culture," Ms. Tshiela said. "Not every product is meant for everybody."

'Air' Floats an Idea: Share the Profits: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The movie's focus (how Michael Jordan got a cut from Nike) reflects what its filmmakers, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, are trying to do in their new venture.
There can only be so much suspense in "Air." The new drama depicts Nike's quest in 1984 to sign the then-rookie Michael Jordan to an endorsement deal, and everyone knows that in the end, Nike will get its man. Some viewers are doubtlessly wearing Swoosh-adorned Air Jordan sneakers.
Yet the filmmakers conjure a gripping moment late in the film. Through wit and grit, Sonny Vaccaro, the Nike executive played by Matt Damon, has secured Jordan's agreement -- until Jordan's mother, Deloris Jordan (Viola Davis), makes an additional demand: Her son must receive not only a $ 250,000 fee, but also a cut from every sneaker sold.
"A shoe is just a shoe," she tells Vaccaro, "until my son steps into it."
This seemingly small nuance, more than just a plot development, embodies one of the central themes of "Air": the value a talented individual brings to a business and the importance of compensating him for what he is worth.
"He created that value," Damon, also a producer, said in an interview. "Yeah, they had some great advertising campaigns, right? But Michael Jordan going out and being the best player every single night is what put the meaning in the shoe."
The lesson of "Air" can also be applied to the new company that produced it. Artists Equity was co-founded by Damon and his longtime friend Ben Affleck to make movies that earn more money for their artistic talent. "Air" -- directed by Affleck, who also plays the Nike co-founder and chief executive Phil Knight -- was deliberately the company's first project.
"Thematically it was on point in terms of what we're trying to do with the new company," Damon said of "Air."
He elaborated: "Sonny feels, like we do, that the people who are putting the value in something deserve to share in the revenue and be compensated, and rather than it being extractive, it's a partnership."
The message of "Air" might help explain why it has been embraced by critics and audiences. It turns Michael Jordan from an extraordinary athlete into a stand-in for the viewer. "He's not the underdog compared to the everyday person, but he's still someone people can relate to," said Thilo Kunkel, a professor at Temple University who studies athlete branding.
In real life, it was Nike that initially offered Jordan a piece of the business -- it was "the bait on the fishing hook," Vaccaro said in an interview. Nike had been desperate to outbid its larger rivals, Converse and Adidas, to secure the rights to a player it predicted would be a generational talent.
The film closely reflects reality, Vaccaro added, in portraying this proposal as important to Deloris Jordan, the central decision maker in her household. "She reminded me 10 times before you saw it in the last scene," Vaccaro said, adding, "The only reason that we survived and we won was because of him having a piece."
Vaccaro's career in basketball and the shoe business is rich enough that years ago there was very nearly a movie made about a completely different period of his life (he was to have been played by James Gandolfini). Vaccaro started organizing high school all-star games in the 1960s. At Nike he not only helped sign Jordan, he also pioneered contracts with college basketball coaches that put Nike sneakers on their players, as N.C.A.A. rules barred the athletes from making their own deals. In the '90s, he signed Kobe Bryant to Adidas.
But the real-life Vaccaro took to heart the moral of "Air" during his late-career shift from shoe-company veteran to gadfly who helped college athletes win the right to sign endorsement deals of their own.
In 2007, he quit the sneaker business (his résumé also included Reebok) and became an advocate for college players' rights. For lawyers looking to sue over colleges' profiting from their players' names, images and likenesses, Vaccaro helped find an ideal lead plaintiff: the former U.C.L.A. basketball star Ed O'Bannon. The lawsuit filed in 2009 and known as the O'Bannon case, along with other lawsuits, state legislation and a sea change in public opinion -- itself cultivated partly by Vaccaro, an easy and colorful quote for journalists -- led the N.C.A.A. in 2021 to begin letting college athletes sign endorsement deals.
"To allow me to get to Eddie O'Bannon -- it never would have happened without me being with Michael Jordan," Vaccaro said.
Jay Bilas, an ESPN college basketball commentator, perceives a connection between Jordan's securing a cut of his Nike business and Vaccaro's lobbying to get college athletes more of the profits they help generate.
"It's the same analysis," said Bilas, who played basketball for Duke University when Jordan was on the archrival University of North Carolina Tar Heels. "Whether it's an hourly worker negotiating with McDonald's or doctors and nurses negotiating with a hospital system, what's always true is that the business is going to make substantially more than the worker. Everyone in America, in a free-market system, deserves the right to negotiate for their fair value."
At the film premiere last month, Damon said, the audience "erupted into applause" at the end when onscreen text described Vaccaro's involvement in the O'Bannon case.
"It was thematically right for the movie, but it was also perfect for Sonny," Damon said.
"The obvious thing he would go do was go fight for them," Damon added. "It's in keeping with how you see him throughout the movie, genuinely caring -- it's not just business for him. This is his passion and it's his love. There's a morality that grounds it."
Damon is engaged in a similar enterprise. He and Affleck substituted filmmakers for athletes into Vaccaro's equation, and, backed by $ 100 million from a private investment firm, started Artists Equity last year to restore to filmmakers a share of projects' profits that had disappeared as Hollywood moved toward streaming and studios scaled back on the most generous deals.
In Artists Equity's view, turning filmmakers -- from stars like Damon and Davis to directors, cinematographers and editors -- into something less like employees and more like financial partners will give them an incentive to make better movies more efficiently.
"'Profit participation' is the key phrase," said Jason Squire, a professor emeritus at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. "If they fulfill this, it'll be a wonderful, refreshed model for this part of the business."
For its part, "Air" appears to be a financial success. The film was acquired by Amazon for $ 130 million. It opened last Wednesday exclusively in theaters (in advance of becoming available on Amazon's streaming platform), and exceeded expectations with a box office take that hovered around $ 20 million.
Affleck's argument for the model could have come from Deloris Jordan. "This business has never incentivized and made congruent the interest of the artist and the people financing," he said at a New York Times conference last year. Referring to his wife, the pop star and actress Jennifer Lopez, he added, "The people who principally create value on the sales side and on the audience eyeball side are these artists who have worked their entire careers -- like my wife -- building a name, a reputation, a connection with fans that has real value. And oftentimes that value isn't reflected in the deals."
There is an irony in the argument about people getting shortchanged by the old way of doing business. Michael Jordan, Matt Damon -- these are some of the more enviable people on Earth.
But anyone who has shelled out for a pair of Air Jordans or watched the Chicago Bulls win six world championships in the 1990s can testify that Jordan deserved a good deal of credit.
And in ceding a small percentage of the Air Jordan profits to its namesake, Nike did not exactly suffer. Along with the applause-generating reveal about Vaccaro's successful advocacy on behalf of college athletes, the viewer of "Air" learns at the end of the film that Nike went on to buy its former rival Converse on its way to becoming the juggernaut it is today. Last year, Nike said Jordan Brand brought in $ 5 billion in annual revenue.
"Ben says it as the Phil Knight character," Damon said. "He goes, 'If this kid makes a bunch of money on this deal, it will be the best thing that ever happened for Nike.' Right? It was really a deal that favored everybody. Absolutely everybody won."

H&M Makes It Easier to Dress Like a Pop Diva: [Style Desk]

Full text: With a graphic new H&M capsule collection and joyful accompanying video, Mugler celebrates the inclusivity the label's founder pioneered.
Just when so much in the culture is stuck in what can seem like a grimly benighted loop comes a ray of alt-cult sunshine to brighten our tiny screens. What unexpected form does it take? A music video.
Nowadays the announcement of a new high fashion-high street collaboration is roughly as exciting as a Steve Madden flash sale on Amazon. Yet the stakes were raised anew when the giant Swedish retailer H&M announced early this year that it had teamed up with the house of Mugler for a capsule collection designed by the label's creative director Casey Cadwallader.
It's Mr. Cadwallader who boosted the storied Mugler label when he came onboard in 2017, quickly infusing a fusty heritage brand with energy by introducing spiral-cut illusion effect bodysuits that soon became a default pop star uniform. Think Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé on the cover of British Vogue. What the world's second-largest fashion retailer sought in the Mugler collaboration was the opportunity to recharge flagging sales and restore the high-fashion cred imparted by prior collaborations with, among others, Versace, Comme des Garçons, Stella McCartney and Balmain.
"We have a big design team, and when we asked people what they would like to see next, everyone kept saying Mugler," Ann-Sofie Johansson, the creative adviser to H&M since 2015, said by phone. "Manfred was the first to dig into subcultures, different personas, different age groups and sizes on his runways."
Ms. Johansson was referring, of course, to Manfred Thierry Mugler, the founder of the house, who died last year at 73. Undeniably, Mr. Mugler's legacy rests not just on his hypersexualized designs but equally on his head-on confrontations with racism, ageism and body-shaming, positions he made clear throughout his career in highly theatrical shows cast with drag performers, trans women, porn stars, muscle men and models from across the age spectrum.
It was in that spirit that Mr. Cadwallader approached the making of the deliriously upbeat music video that accompanies the rollout of a stark and sexy Mugler H&M collaboration, which drops in early May. "Of course, I have to create desire and an energy people want to became a part of," Mr. Cadwallader said by phone from Paris. "But I've always had a democratic sense to what fashion means."
No believer in "fashion being for the exclusive few," Mr. Cadwallader conceptualized a graphic production set to the propulsive soundtrack of that endlessly sampled 1990s dance tune, "Music Sounds Better With You" -- sung by a girl group made up of the musicians Shygirl, Eartheater and Amaarae and in the background a welter of top models like Imaan Hammam, Selena Forrest and Anna Ewers, performers like the Venezuelan trans musician and producer Arca and a posse of variously gendered others stomping across miles of white seamless paper or -- metaphor, anyone? -- blowing through walls.
Oh, and there is a talk-show segment, hosted by the trans artist and gender pioneer Connie Fleming, a.k.a. Connie Girl, and Jerry Hall.
"Instead of trying to get the fashion 'It' girls or whoever is trending, I always wanted to get people Mr. Mugler might have worked with," Mr. Cadwallader said. That includes "curvy" women like Mr. Cadwallader's mother and sister, physical types historically invisible to high fashion. There are also those like Ms. Hall who, at 66, has reached an age at which most runway models are cast out on the ice.
"I don't think models have a shelf life," Mr. Cadwallader said.
Far from seeming like a cynical market foray, the inclusivity on display in the video is unabashedly celebratory, a seemingly organic reflection of gender realities some would see legislated out of existence. "We as a company are for the fashion-interested person -- women mainly, but really everyone," Ms. Johansson said. And the Mugler collection of men's and women's clothing and accessories, as shown in the video, bears out that assertion.
"Inclusivity was always in the DNA of Thierry Mugler," said Ms. Fleming, a downtown New York legend who first walked the designer's runways in the '90s. "His vision was all sizes, all ages, all colors, all expressions. Back then it was considered subversive and theatrical and outlandish. What Casey is doing is using that initial vision to reflect the world back to itself."

Full text: The service, which will debut on May 23, will try to broaden appeal by including reality series like TLC's "Love & Translation" alongside HBO dramas like "Succession."
Farewell, HBO. Hello, Max.
The new streaming service uniting HBO titles like "Succession" and "The White Lotus" with Discovery reality series like "My Feet Are Killing Me" and "Sister Wives" will be named Max, Warner Bros. Discovery executives announced on Wednesday.
The service, which will replace HBO Max, will debut on May 23, less than three years after the introduction of HBO Max. It will cost, at least for now, the price of HBO Max: $ 16 a month for a commercial-free experience, and $ 10 a month for an advertising-supported tier.
The app for Max will ditch the purple color scheme of HBO Max in favor of a blue-and-white one. The "a" in Max will have a white dot at its center, paying homage to the "O" in HBO, and the app will give prominent placement to the HBO brand, including its past, current and future programming. It will include a dedicated tile to the network.
Max will be the latest entrant in the so-called streaming wars. Entertainment executives have scrambled over the past year to make their services profitable instead of trumpeting subscriber counts. When Discovery merged with WarnerMedia, forming Warner Bros. Discovery, in April 2022, the potential for a combined streaming service was a critical part of the merger's justification.
At a news conference on Wednesday at the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif., company executives said they felt that, after 50 years of being marketed as a premium adult service, the HBO name was limiting to consumers, particularly children.
"It was a brand built over five decades to be edgy, groundbreaking and a trendsetter for entertainment in adults," JB Perrette, the president of global streaming at Warner Bros. Discovery, said of HBO. "It's not exactly where parents would most eagerly drop off their kids."
Casey Bloys, the chairman of HBO who has overseen the network's programming since 2016, expressed some relief about the name change now that Discovery's extensive library of reality and unscripted series would flood the service.
"What I am most concerned about is protecting the HBO brand," he told reporters. "It is a premium brand. It's not designed to be for mass audiences. And the more that you ask the HBO brand to take on more programming, I think the further it stretches it."
Mr. Bloys announced several new programs for the service, including a new "Game of Thrones" spinoff and a series based on J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" books.
But he quickly exited the stage when it was time for an announcement about several reality series from Discovery's stable of brands, including a competition series from HGTV, "Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge," and a TLC show, "Love & Translation." Set on a remote island, the TLC series features three scantily-clad American men and a dozen women vying to find love. None of the women speak English.
Warner Bros. Discovery said it anticipated 130 million subscribers by 2025, nearly 100 million fewer than the current number of paying members for either Netflix or Disney -- across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.
But Warner Bros. executives have argued that profitability is most important, not subscriber counts. They said Max and Discovery+ would break even by next year, and be profitable by 2025.
HBO has been on a roll in recent months with several hit series, including the debut seasons of "The House of the Dragon" and "The Last of Us," but the amount of time consumers spend on HBO Max ranks well behind Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, according to Nielsen.
The company's executives are hoping that Discovery's more passive programming options will increase viewers' time on the app and reduce the number of subscribers who cancel the service, said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery.
"Holding subs is as important as adding subs," Mr. Zaslav said. "Together, they pack a powerful one-two punch."

HBO and Discovery to Combine in 'Max' Service: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The service, expected to be called Max, is meant to help the company compete more directly with Netflix and Disney.
Two years ago, the media mogul David Zaslav said he had a plan to compete with the streaming titans Netflix and Disney: Combine the scripted entertainment of HBO Max with Discovery's library of reality and unscripted series. The goal, he said in 2021, was to be "one of the top streaming companies in the world."
He is about to put that idea to the test.
On Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery executives will unveil plans for the new combined streaming service, bringing together classic HBO series like "The Sopranos" and "Succession" with Discovery series like "Dr. Pimple Popper" and "Fixer Upper." The service will be called Max and debut in the next month or two, according to three people with knowledge of the decision.
The streaming service will cost roughly $ 16 a month -- the price of HBO Max now -- though there will be several price tiers, including a less expensive one with advertising, the people said.
Success of the new service is crucial for Warner Bros. Discovery, which Mr. Zaslav formed last April with the blockbuster merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. He sold shareholders on the deal in part by arguing that the combined company could have a killer app.
The company has had a rough opening 12 months, shelving projects and laying off thousands. Many of the moves were part of an effort to help pay down an enormous debt load of about $ 50 billion.
The importance of the new streaming service is not lost on top executives. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the chief financial officer for Warner Bros. Discovery, said at an investor conference last month that the service was "one of our big, big priorities for this year."
"It's an absolutely critical milestone," he continued.
Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery, like those at other major entertainment companies, know full well that streaming entertainment is the future. But most companies are losing hundreds of millions on streaming services just as revenue from traditional cable TV is falling, leaving them in a bit of a bind. Warner Bros. Discovery owns more than a dozen cable networks.
For years, entertainment executives aimed to dazzle Wall Street by trumpeting streaming subscriber counts. After Netflix's surprising subscriber decline in the first quarter of last year, though, media executives and Wall Street began raising urgent questions about whether streaming services had started to hit a ceiling on subscribers in the United States. Profitability became a much greater focus.
Warner Bros. Discovery still has a subscriber goal for its streaming division -- 130 million by 2025, up from the 96.1 million now -- that would vastly trail Netflix's current total of 231 million and Disney's 235 million subscribers across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. But executives now believe that the service's profitability is the most vital benchmark.
The company is projecting that the streaming division will break even by next year and be profitable in two years. In the company's most recent quarterly earnings, streaming lost $ 217 million, cutting losses significantly from a few months ago, and was regarded as a win by some analysts.
Because of the focus on profitability -- and the fact that the streaming service is a combination of Warner Bros. Discovery's existing services, not an entirely new one -- the Wednesday announcement will hardly look like the splashy streaming dog and pony shows that media companies staged just a few years ago.
When Disney held an event to announce Disney+ in April 2019, it did so over three and a half hours in an extravagant showcase for investors. Likewise, Apple staged a star-studded event that previewed Apple TV+ at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., in March 2019, flying in dozens of boldface names like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston.
By contrast, Warner Bros. Discovery's event will be just over an hour and feature no stars, said the people with knowledge of the company's plans. Instead, the event will unveil the new service's name, marketing plans and technological upgrades, as well as some TV series and movie announcements.
It is not yet clear how existing subscribers will migrate from HBO Max to the new service once it's available. That is one of the topics that executives are expected to address on Wednesday. Discovery+ will remain a stand-alone app.
Some analysts question whether combining Discovery's library of programming with the scripted shows available on HBO Max will put the new combined app over the top. Julia Alexander, the director of strategy at the research firm Parrot Analytics, said she was "skeptical that it will drive the level of subscriber acquisition that some on Wall Street are looking for."
But, she argued, it will help with time spent on the app, pointing to data that many subscribers use streaming services for ambient television experiences -- the kind of watch-it-while-you-fold-the-laundry fare that is Discovery's bread and butter with brands like HGTV and the Food Network.
"You're opening HBO Max once a week and might not open it up for the rest of the week," she said. "They want you to open it two, three or four times a week. Unscripted programming creates that increased engagement."
Indeed, even though HBO has been on a delirious hot streak -- one hit after the next going back to August, including "The House of the Dragon," "The White Lotus," "The Last of Us" and, now, "Succession" -- the amount of time spent on the app in the United States is toiling in the lower-middle ranks of the top streaming services.
According to Nielsen, 1.3 percent of the total minutes spent by Americans using television was with HBO Max in February, a fraction of what YouTube (7.9 percent), Netflix (7.3 percent), Hulu (3.3 percent) and Amazon Prime (3 percent) garnered. HBO Max instead finds itself in the same neighborhood as Comcast's Peacock and the Fox Corporation's free advertising-supported streaming service, Tubi.
If there is more time spent on the new service, Ms. Alexander said, that could help prevent subscribers from canceling the service when the company inevitably raises the price. And it could increase revenue from advertisers on the streaming service's lower-priced tier.
And removing HBO from the streaming service's name also signals an ambition to attract more subscribers.
"Dropping HBO from the name is cementing that 'we're not just a home for premium programming,"' Ms. Alexander said. "'We're the home for anything you want to watch."'

FRONT PAGE
An article on Sunday about leaked Pentagon documents that reveal Russia's military struggles misstated the name of a U.S. law on national security surveillance. It is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, not the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act.
An article on Monday about North Carolina's role in the fight for Medicaid expansion misquoted Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina. He said: "They immediately sued me in federal court to stop me. And we could have set it aside at that point, but we persisted, and that's because we knew it was too important." He did not say, "They sued me in federal court to stop it, and we kind of set it aside."
An article on Saturday about risky moves from tech companies to win the race for artificial intelligence misstated the number of years that have passed since Microsoft shut down a chatbot called Tay. It was seven years ago, not five.
BUSINESS
An article on Friday about continued unproven claims online about Dominion Voting Systems misstated an election change that Shasta County approved last month. The county voted to hand-count paper ballots. It did not vote to use paper ballots, which were already in use.
An article on Saturday about Amazon's plan to release movies in theaters misstated the name of an AMC movie theater in Las Vegas. It is AMC Town Square, not AMC Town Center.
SPORTS
A picture caption with an article on Monday about Jon Rahm's victory in the Masters Tournament omitted the name of the golfer who shot a final-round score of 75. It was Brooks Koepka, not Rahm; Rahm shot a 69.
OPINION
An article on Friday about online advertising described a statistic about ad expenditures by Jeremy's Razors on Facebook incorrectly. In the 30 days ending March 26, Jeremy's Razors was the biggest ad buyer among advertisers whose spending is disclosed in Facebook's ad trans­parency reports, not the most overall.

Full text: Donna Lieberman, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, "steps back" from job pressures with family outings and a swim.
"I was born into the McCarthy era," Donna Lieberman said. But she certainly didn't stay there.
As the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, Ms. Lieberman is dedicated to protecting individual freedoms, especially free speech. "My job allows me to elevate the voice of justice over this cacophony of disinformation and fear mongering that we're dealing with," she said.
Where she has stayed -- for almost five decades -- is the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Since 1974, Ms. Lieberman, 74, has lived there with her husband, Bill Stampur, 76, a criminal defense lawyer.
RISE, READ I'm up before Billy at 6 or 7 a.m. with the Kindle under my pillow. For the next few hours, I hang out reading. I binge on authors. Right now, it's Francisco Goldman. I just read "The Long Night of White Chickens" and "Monkey Boy."
CUP DU JOUR I also drink three or four cappuccinos, which I make with milk, from a 1970s Cremina. It's a simple but elegant machine. Every year I bring it to Zabar's to get serviced. I'm also a potter. Every cappuccino I drink comes in one of my cups. I probably have 30 different ones. The cup I pick out reflects my mood that day. It's a cup du jour.
FAMILY BREAKFAST At 9 a.m. my son, Gui, and his son, Nico, who is 6 -- and sometimes his wife, Tara, and their 1-year-old, Willa -- come over for breakfast to watch the Leeds United soccer game. They're in the Premier League. My son coached someone on the team and my grandson is obsessed with the game. They bring bagels from Absolute near 108th Street. I'll make bacon and eggs. Nico has eaten the bacon before it gets to the table. Sometimes my daughter, Liana, comes in from Inwood with her daughter Corina. We try to eat together around the table but end up going back and forth to watch the game.
GAME ON Sometimes Nico has a soccer clinic at Riverside Park. Afterward we kick the ball around, parents against kids. I'm on the kids' side. I broke my foot a few months ago, so I don't have a mean left kick. I never did. But I'm good at cheering.
MEET AT THE MARKET By 11 a.m., we are on to other things. Billy and I head to the 79th Street Greenmarket, which wraps around the American Museum of Natural History. Billy walks. I ride my bike. The lock weighs as much as the bike. I'm a cautious and conservative rider. I do the bike path at Riverside Park and the bike lanes on Columbus Avenue. We get there at the same time because he's a fast walker and I'm a slow rider.
THE GOODS We meet at She Wolf Bakery, which sells amazing breads and things. They don't have a retail outlet; they just sell at farmers' markets. We buy a loaf or two, then we're on to the fish guy. Sometimes it's clams for pasta or cod with sorrel sauce. Billy loves the granola guy.
LIFELINE During Covid, my friend Mary Hedahl and I started a standing lunch date each week at Tarallucci e Vino. We ate outside for over two years. It was a silver lining in the pandemic. We are a lifeline for each other. Mary is one of the most upbeat people I know. We count on having this time to laugh, reflect and revel.
POOL THEATRICS I usually bike to Manhattan Plaza Health Club to swim. It's a subsidized housing complex for the arts. They have the best pool in the city. It's totally inconvenient, but I love it. It's filled with theater people. It's not all buff and muscles. They look like me.
GAMES I'm back home by 5 p.m. and for the next hour, I usually do puzzles, which are both mindless and mindful. If I didn't do Wordle with Nico -- whose first guess is always "train," then "daddy," or "poops" -- I do that, then Quordle and whatever puzzles are in the paper or on the computer. Recently, when I finished the acrostic, I was happy to see the quote was from my college friend Katha Pollitt.
ITALIAN DINNER Every few months I go to Borgatti's near Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. They make great fresh spinach pasta. I buy a few pounds and freeze it. We might add that to whatever we bought at the market. Or we go out. It depends on how much energy I have or what the kids are doing. I'll take any opportunity to hang out with them. The eight of us go to Gennaro. We've been eating and ordering from them since my son was in high school. It feels like family. We talk over each other and bring crayons for the kids and try to get them their food first. Then we nibble on what they're eating as we wait for our meals. When I'm with them, it gives me space to step back from how troubled the world is and the tensions of my work life, and to just take pleasure in them and their innocence.
PROGRESS IS POSSIBLE We're out by 7 p.m. because Willa turns into a pumpkin. At home we veg out and watch something on PBS. We've been watching "Miss Scarlet and the Duke," "All Creatures Great and Small" and "Call the Midwife." They're optimistic. You see issues on the screen and people having to fight for their place in life as a thread. Seeing women fighting for their place in society in 1950 is powerful. It reaffirms that every generation has its quiet heroes and progress is possible.
DROOPY LIDS TV eventually becomes the backdrop. Sometimes I close my eyes and I'm out. I wake up around midnight. Bill is out, too. I wake him and we go to bed. If I don't fall asleep, I'll go to bed first, and he shows up whenever he shows up.

Full text: This month's picks include a basketball-themed high school comedy, epic animated journeys and a touching story of friendship from Kenya.
'Chang Can Dunk'
Stream it on Disney+.
Bernard Chang (Bloom Li) is a basketball fanatic, but at 5-foot-8 and 16 years old, with more practice playing in the high school marching band than dribbling down the court, he's used to cheering from the sidelines. Chang's harried, working single mom (Mardy Ma) is tired of his indecisiveness, telling him early on, "You always change your mind, so find something and stick to it." He can't commit to a haircut, much less a career path. But when he bets the school jock (Chase Liefeld) that he can learn to dunk a basketball in time for homecoming, Chang finally finds something he can stick to. Written and directed by Jingyi Shao, who honed his skills helming commercials and short films, "Chang Can Dunk" puts an Asian American teenager front and center in this coming-of-age story that'll appeal to older kids, who will relate to Chang's desire to get the girl (Zoe Renee), beat the bad guy and -- most important of all -- dunk that basketball.
'The Magician's Elephant'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Based on the book by the Newbery Award winner Kate DiCamillo, this fantastical animated tale is about a young orphan named Peter (voiced by Noah Jupe) who is determined to find the long-lost sister he'd been told was dead. The people in his once vibrant, now war-torn town, Baltese, have lost all belief in magic. Gray, balloon-like clouds hang over the city, blocking the sunlight and keeping the citizens longing for better days. When a fortune teller instructs Peter to "follow the magician's elephant" to find his sister, the adventure begins. Peter must do a "series of impossible things" to rescue the elephant that the magician (Benedict Wong) conjured out of thin air, find his sister and bring some hope back to Baltese. The voice cast is solid (Mandy Patinkin plays the gruff soldier who is raising Peter as his own) and the director, Wendy Rogers, who worked in visual effects on films like "Puss in Boots" and "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," creates interesting visuals and plenty of action to keep easily distracted little viewers invested.
'Big Trip 2: Special Delivery'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The "adorable animals on an epic journey" genre has enchanted young viewers for decades -- "Homeward Bound" and "The Adventures of Milo and Otis" being just two beloved examples. This animated follow-up to "The Big Trip" doesn't reinvent the wheel, and it does rehash much of the plot of the first film, but Oscar the rabbit (voiced by Jesse McCartney) and his grumpy bear pal Mic-Mic (Pauly Shore) are a cute duo whose comedic antics should keep toddlers and younger kids entertained. Over in the United Forest of America, the evil Don Vulture is running for president against a bear, John Grizzly. (There is talk of "fake lies" and "big empty promises," so you can probably guess which real-life former president the vulture is modeled after.) The law says no childless animal can become president, but the stork delivered Grizzly's cub to the wrong home, so our heroes must race to return the cub in time for the election. Along the way they battle hungry hyenas and snowstorms, protecting the cooing baby bear so they can complete their quest.
'Fireheart'
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Directed by the BAFTA winner Laurent Zeitoun ("The Death of Stalin," "The Intouchables") with Theodore Ty, "Fireheart" tells a story of female rebellion through the character of Georgia Nolan (voiced by Olivia Cooke), a teenage girl in 1932 New York City who wishes she were allowed to fight fires like her dad, Shawn (Kenneth Branagh). When Shawn is asked to come out of retirement to help stop a mysterious serial arsonist, Georgia decides to make her dream a reality -- by disguising herself as a man named Joe. She puts mangoes in her shirt to create biceps, and clips her pet Dalmatian's fur to make a mustache. Silly? Sure, but young kids will hopefully cheer Georgia's willingness to chase her dream despite the odds. There are some sweet moments between Georgia and her dad, and the firefighting scenes will excite the imaginations of little ones. The soundtrack ranges from Roaring Twenties-inspired tunes to Wham! (an on-the-nose "I'm Your Man") and the visuals aren't pushing any boundaries, but not every animated film can be "Avatar."
'Safari'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Film is a visual medium, so no matter that this Kenya-set film has subtitles that most little ones won't have the ability (or patience) to read. The story centers on a shy young boy named Safari (Victor Fadhili), who uses a wheelchair and isn't allowed to talk to strangers or venture far from his rural home. He yearns to see the country and spot a real elephant in the wild, not just on his TV. After he befriends a gutsy neighbor girl named Kiki (Abilasha Muthoni), the two embark on an adventure that has them facing down evil poachers, wild animals and big-city life. The film is written and produced by Njue Kevin, who made Forbes Africa's 30 Under 30 list in 2019, and directed by Bill Jones Afwani (who is also a co-writer). The visuals are beautiful, and the children's performances are genuine and touching. The film might not hold the attention of all kids, but it's definitely worth a shot.

Basketball, War and Sleepaway Camp in Earlier Times: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Author: Kenigsberg, Ben

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a film about a summer camp for the disabled, a portrait of a defense secretary's regrets about the Vietnam War and one of the best sport documentaries of all time.
The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we'll choose three nonfiction films -- classics, overlooked recent docs and more -- that will reward your time.
'Hoop Dreams' (1994)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel, HBO Max, Peacock, Tubi and Vudu.
With March Madness in full swing, it is as good a time as ever to revisit "Hoop Dreams," certainly the best film ever made about the pipeline that takes young basketball players from blacktops in impoverished city neighborhoods to high school athletics and eventually college teams, with a promise of success that will elude all but a small few. Touching on issues of race, economics, education and exploitation, it follows the players and their families through the late 1980s and early 1990s. In sheer scope and by popular acclamation, it is one of the most extraordinary, compassionate and committed of all documentaries.
Directed by Steve James, "Hoop Dreams" semi-separately observes two teenagers from different neighborhoods in Chicago -- William Gates, from the rowhouses of the Cabrini-Green housing project, and Arthur Agee, from the Garfield Park area of the city's west side -- whose lives occasionally intersect. Both are invited to play for St. Joseph High School, a well-appointed private Catholic school a 90-minute commute away in the suburbs. St. Joseph's lures students with the expectation that they might become the next Isiah Thomas, an alumnus turned N.B.A. sensation. Thomas's high school coach, Gene Pingatore, is still basking in that glory and is happy to name-drop "Isiah." Pingatore lives in the apparent hope that lightning will strike twice.
But this isn't a film about how Agee and Gates made it to the N.B.A. Quite the contrary: It is a chronicle of how their hoop dreams are deferred at nearly every turn, and of how the big-money machinery of institutional basketball cares little for the people it ensnares. The subjects' fates are nearly always poised on a financial precipice.
When Agee, who has a partial scholarship, falls behind on tuition, St. Joseph's forces him to leave, even withholding his transcript from his public school until his parents -- a mother who has lost her minimum-wage job as a nurse's assistant and a father who has just rejoined the family after grappling with addiction and incarceration -- can cover the balance. His coach at his new school suggests that were Agee playing at the level St. Joseph's had expected, money wouldn't have been an issue. Gates receives financial help on top of his scholarship, but a knee injury sidelines him. Even after recovering, he is under pressure to play when he probably shouldn't. A potential college scholarship hinges on an ACT score that seems just out of reach. His brother, whose own basketball ambitions were dashed, lives vicariously through him. And almost incidentally, Gates is a new father, determined to be better than his own largely absent dad, in a movie that has a lot to say about parents' hopes for their children.
'The Fog of War' (2003)
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV and Google Play.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Just two months after the start of the Iraq War, Errol Morris, at Cannes, unveiled a film in which Robert S. McNamara, one of the key American officials who oversaw the Vietnam War, reflected on that conflict with something like remorse. Although the documentary was about events that had occurred more than three decades earlier, it couldn't have been timelier when it opened 20 years ago -- not least because archival images of the polished, technocratic McNamara smiling and delivering sanguine news about Vietnam couldn't help but call to mind then-current images of George W. Bush's defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, selling the invasion of Iraq, or because of McNamara's assertion that the United States should not ever apply its military power unilaterally.
In "The Fog of War," which went on to win Morris his only Oscar so far, the 85-year-old McNamara, the defense secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, tries to draw conclusions about his experiences during Vietnam and in World War II, when he was involved in the firebombing of Japan. ("What makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?" he asks of that campaign.)
When it comes to Vietnam, McNamara is both reflective and deflective, suggesting that he was not the warmonger he was portrayed as and was instead primarily executing President Johnson's wishes -- and that had President Kennedy lived, he would have found a way to limit the conflict's scale. ("I don't think we would have had 500,000 men there," McNamara says.) At other times, McNamara's downplaying is less persuasive. "I'm not really sure I authorized Agent Orange -- I don't remember it," he says, "but it certainly occurred, the use of it occurred while I was secretary."
At the time, critics wondered if Morris was essentially having the wool pulled over his eyes. (It's a familiar charge against the filmmaker, who faced similar accusations with his documentary on Steve Bannon, "American Dharma.") But the portrait of McNamara is too complex to qualify as a simple exoneration. In one of the most jaw-dropping moments, McNamara recalls meeting in 1995 with Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's former foreign minister, and being blindsided by Thach's assertion that the Vietnamese had seen themselves as fighting for their independence, not as pawns of the Chinese or the Russians. How, Thach apparently asked, could McNamara not have known that? The premise for his entire war was wrong.
Morris went on to address the Iraq War head-on in "Standard Operating Procedure" and the Rumsfeld portrait "The Unknown Known," both of which are in the news again with the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. But perhaps neither of them so directly confronts the issue of guilt, an emotion to which McNamara, in the film's closing moments, declines to admit. "I'd rather be damned if I don't," he says.
'Crip Camp' (2020)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Before she was a disability rights activist, Judy Heumann, who died earlier this month at 75, was a counselor at Camp Jened, which operated as a sleepaway camp for the disabled from the 1950s through the 1970s. The movie argues that the ties and friendships formed there -- at a time when disabled teenagers had few shared spaces to connect freely and be themselves -- laid the groundwork for the American disability rights movement, especially once several former campers gathered in the revolutionary ferment of Berkeley, Calif., in the 1970s.
Incredibly, the directors, Nicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht, who attended the camp himself, have footage of the campers as campers, in vintage material shot by a collective called the People's Video Theater -- which means there's a pleasing then-and-now quality to the movie. Heumann is introduced at age 23 conducting a vote on whether the campers should cook lasagna on a Wednesday evening -- a humble origin story for an activist who, among many other achievements, would help lead a multiweek sit-in in San Francisco in 1977 to ensure the implementation of federal protections for the disabled. (Lots of other Jened alumni are identified in images from that demonstration as well.) Much later on, Heumann became a special adviser for international disability rights at the State Department under President Obama, who is one of this documentary's executive producers.
Heumann is just one of many campers we get to meet in this engaging, inspiring film. They include LeBrecht himself (who has worked in sound design) and the couple Neil Jacobson and Denise Sherer Jacobson. Denise tells the story of how she chose to pursue a master's degree in human sexuality after she unnecessarily had her appendix removed, because a doctor had failed to consider that a patient with cerebral palsy just might have a sexually transmitted disease.

Walmart Plans Network Of E.V. Charging Stations
Walmart plans to have its own network of electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 to tap into the growing adoption of E.V.s. The new fast-charging stations will be placed at thousands of Walmart and Sam's Club stores, alongside nearly 1,300 it already offers in a deal with the Volkswagen unit Electrify America. Walmart's more than 5,000 stores and Sam's Club warehouses are within 10 miles of about 90 percent of Americans. "We have the ability to address range and charging anxiety in a way that no one else can in this country," Vishal Kapadia, Walmart's recently appointed senior vice president of Energy Transformation, said in an interview. As E.V. charging infrastructure ramps up in the United States, there are widespread concerns over uptime, performance, ease of use and high installation costs of the machines. Mr. Kapadia said he expected there will be four chargers on average installed per store. REUTERS
ACQUISITIONS
Amazon's Bid for iRobot Faces Antitrust Scrutiny
British antitrust regulators have started investigating Amazon's purchase of the robot vacuum maker iRobot, adding further scrutiny to the $ 1.7 billion deal. The Competition and Markets Authority said Thursday that it was considering whether the deal will result in a "substantial lessening of competition" within the United Kingdom. In an initial step, the U.K. watchdog invited comments on the deal from "any interested party." The acquisition is already facing a review in the U.S. by the Federal Trade Commission amid worries about Amazon's growing market power. Consumer groups had voiced concerns after the deal was announced last year that it would further the e-commerce giant's dominance in the smart home market. The Bedford, Mass.-based company, which makes the popular Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners, said it "continues to work cooperatively with both the F.T.C. in the U.S. and other regulatory agencies in their review of the AmazoniRobot merger."

OpenAI Tries to Resolve Privacy Issue With Italy
The company behind ChatGPT will propose measures to resolve data privacy concerns that sparked a temporary Italian ban on the artificial intelligence chatbot, regulators said Thursday. The Italian data protection authority, known as Garante, last week blocked San Franciscobased OpenAI's popular chatbot, ordering it to temporarily stop processing Italian users' personal information while it investigates a possible breach of European Union data privacy rules. Experts said it was the first such case of a democracy imposing a nationwide ban on a mainstream A.I. platform. In a video call Wednesday between the watchdog's commissioners and OpenAI executives, including Sam Altman, the chief executive, the company promised to address the concerns. The regulators imposed the ban after some users' messages and payment information were exposed. ASSOCIATED PRESS

This Weekend I Have ...: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Our TV critic recommends checking out a terrific basketball drama, a fun music documentary and an odd comedy-reality hybrid.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I want something lyrical.
'The Crossover'
When to watch: Now, on Disney+.
At first glance, "The Crossover" could slot in with shows like "The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers" or "Big Shot," earnest sports coming-of-age stories for the middle-school crowd. But the series, based on the Newberry-winning novel in verse by Kwame Alexander, is more like a junior version of "David Makes Man," poetic and poignant, stylized and smart. The show follows Josh and J.B. (Jalyn Hall and Amir O'Neil), twin brothers who want to follow in their father's basketball-star footsteps and also differentiate themselves from each other and their parents. If your household is not quite ready for "Friday Night Lights," but you still want a family drama with depth, watch this.
... an hour, and I could stand to learn something.
'Great Performances: Now Hear This'
When to watch: Friday at 9 p.m., on PBS.
The violinist and conductor Scott Yoo returns for a fourth season of this ebullient music and travelogue series, which begins with an episode in Buenos Aires that explores the history of tango, in particular the work of the composer Astor Piazzolla. "Hear" covers both the artistic and the mechanical -- who among us has not yearned to know how the guts of an accordion work? -- but its real calling card is the sense of pleasure radiating from the show's participants. Making music together is supposed to be fun! Being really good at it makes it even more fun! (Check local listings for broadcast times.)
... a few hours, and I crave novelty.
'Jury Duty'
When to watch: Begins Friday, on FreeVee.
There are two shows happening inside "Jury Duty": One is a lovable-weirdos mockumentary like "The Office," and the other is a real-life "Truman Show," a psychological experiment designed to entertain. Weirdly ... it mostly works. Ronald Gladden believes that he is serving on a jury and being filmed for a documentary. He is not. Everyone else involved is an actor, each moment a scripted contrivance, and while ridiculousness swirls around him, Ronald remains impressively kind and upbeat. I was afraid the show would feel cruel or depraved, but it's surprisingly endearing. Four episodes drop this week, and two each the next two Fridays.

France Leads the List Of the Global Ultrarich: [Correction]

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.
Mr. Arnault, 74, whose worldwide domain encompasses 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton handbags, Tiffany diamond rings, Christian Dior dresses and Sephora high-end cosmetics, leaped past American technology titans with a fortune estimated at $ 211 billion as of March 10, when the Forbes figures were tallied.
Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, 69, who has led the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest women for three straight years, had an estimated net worth of $ 80.5 billion. A granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder, she is on the company's board and together with her husband makes many of the controlling decisions. Her company's international cosmetics brands include Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline New York and Essie.
The eye-popping figures, which include the billionaires' personal holdings of company stocks, testify to the resilience of wealthy consumers against a cost-of-living crisis, as high earners continued to splurge on luxury goods -- especially in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. L'Oréal had global sales of over $ 38 billion last year, while LVMH had record revenue of $ 80 billion.
"More people are flocking to spending on luxury goods after having survived Covid lockdowns," said Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Bernstein. "The middle class did suffer and is hollowing out. But the wealthy were untouched, and the upper middle class is spending on all fronts."
High-flying technology companies, on the other hand, have faced a major reckoning over the past year amid a surge in interest rates, high inflation and uncertain economic conditions. Rapid growth during the pandemic has been followed by widespread layoffs, and a nearly 30 percent slump in tech shares last year cut sharply into the fortunes of Elon Musk, owner of Twitter and Tesla, and Amazon's executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Musk slipped to second place in Forbes's rankings, with an estimated fortune of $ 180 billion, and Mr. Bezos came in third with $ 114 billion.
The Forbes rankings caused a sensation in France this week, touching off a new round of headlines about income inequality and igniting debates over whether the ultrarich have augmented their fortunes by paying too little in taxes.
The country has been gripped by strikes and increasingly violent street demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension overhaul, which intends to raise the minimum age of retirement to 64 from 62. But the nationwide demonstrations -- another is scheduled for Thursday -- have also become rallying points for a broader protest over a glaring wealth divide. In France, the richest 10 percent hold nearly half of the country's wealth, and the growth of that share has outpaced that held by the rest of the population, according to the French statistics agency Insee. Wealth "remains very unevenly distributed among the population," the agency said.
Many of the protesters have made Mr. Arnault a main target for their ire, wielding unflattering posters and images of the multibillionaire as the symbol of a deeper problem afflicting the country.
"Mr. Arnault is seen as the embodiment of the ultrarich," said Philippe Escande, an economics columnist for the newspaper Le Monde. "But France is a country where equality -- namely 'liberté, égalité and fraternité' -- is very important, dating all the way back to the Revolution," he said. "There is a problem with money."
Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.

A University Seeks a Silicon Valley Workaround for Interns: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Trying to obtain an internship at a leading tech company or start-up can be a depressing quest for many college students, requiring a sustained, semester-long effort -- often with little to show for it but a slew of rejections.
Now Bowie State University, a historically Black university in Bowie, Md., has created its own internship placement program. And it does not require undergraduates to jump through standard Silicon Valley hoops, such as spending countless hours studying for company coding tests or taking high-pressure technical assessments while a tech company interviewer looks on.
"To be honest with you, it's a brutal process," said Rose Shumba, the chair of Bowie State's computer science department, referring to the internship application process at many large tech firms. She described trying to buoy stressed-out students as they prepared for technical interviews that she thought did not assess their skills or professional potential. "We see things very differently here at Bowie."
To widen opportunities for students, the computer science department set up its own internship placement program last year in partnership with a number of companies and government agencies. The program aims to match students directly with employers seeking interns. It also holds training sessions for students on interview skills and workshops on hot topics like machine learning.
The Bowie approach offers students an alternative to the impersonal, mass-scale application system at many large tech firms. That process typically involves tens of thousands of college students submitting their résumés cold to online company portals, where candidates are initially sorted and ranked by résumé-reading software.
At Bowie State, participating employers come frequently to campus to get to know, mentor, interview and directly recruit students for internships in a process that is more intimate than the one-off information sessions that tech companies often arrange with university career centers. And the Bowie process does not typically involve high-stress technical tests. That has spared many students, some of whom have part-time jobs, from spending dozens of unpaid hours on applying for Silicon Valley internship programs.
‌Founded in 1865, Bowie State is a computer science powerhouse among ‌‌historically Black universities. The school is known nationally for its expertise in cybersecurity education. Last fall, the number of Bowie undergraduates majoring in computing soared to 332, a 75 percent jump from 2019.
But over the last several years only a few Bowie students have made it past the vetting process at leading tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle to obtain internships, Dr. Shumba said.
The competition can be stiff. Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, said it typically hires about 600 interns from the more than 100,000 candidates who apply for its summer internship program in the United States each year.
Last summer, with the new program in place, 60 Bowie computing students interned with companies like Deloitte, federal agencies like NASA and local start-ups. One of them was Dejai Brown, now a senior, who is interested in cybersecurity.
Before she started applying for internships, Ms. Brown worked part time at Chick-fil-A. Last year, after Dr. Shumba encouraged her to apply for a government security clearance, Ms. Brown got an internship at the Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command. She also interned at Battelle, a nonprofit technology research giant.
"Recruiters at Battelle reached out to me, took me through the interview process, and they ended up bringing me on," Ms. Brown, 21, said. "That was a lot less stressful than what it could have been with a coding interview."
The Bowie State program addresses socioeconomic barriers -- like lack of technical work experience or industry connections -- that can hinder some students from getting internships.
To help younger students gain relevant experience, Dr. Shumba set up computing research internships on campus. Last year, she also took a group of students on an all-expenses paid trip to the Grace Hopper Celebration in Florida, a major annual conference for women in tech. Six students returned to campus with internship or job offers from Apple, Bank of America, Citibank and other companies.
Among them was Roxan Rockefeller, now a junior, who worked as a software engineering intern last summer at Tata Consultancy Services, a tech company. Then last fall at the conference, she attended an information session by Eli Lilly, the drug giant. That led to an internship interview.
"I have a passion for data, and I just started talking about how I want to explore as many areas as possible with my computer science degree," Ms. Rockefeller, 21, said. "The next day I got a call from one of the recruiters telling me on the phone that I got the internship."
This year, Adobe started its own internship program with Bowie State, focused on cybersecurity. The internships are part of a larger company effort to help prepare more Black and Latino students for tech careers.
This summer, about a dozen Bowie State students will work as cybersecurity interns at Adobe. That will make the Bowie students eligible for full-time job offers from Adobe after they graduate, just like hundreds of other summer interns at the company.

FedEx Will Consolidate Ground and Express Units
FedEx said on Wednesday that it would consolidate its separate delivery companies into a single entity, in a move to slash costs and better compete with United Parcel Service and Amazon. The decision to integrate FedEx Ground, its outsourced package delivery arm, with the FedEx Express overnight air delivery business was announced almost a year after the activist investor D.E. Shaw pushed for change and won two additional board seats. "We will be leaner, more agile and better positioned to execute on our mission," said Raj Subramaniam, the chief executive. The combined business is expected to handle all deliveries from June 2024 as part of the wider plan by the Memphis-based group to cut $ 4 billion in permanent costs by the end of its 2025 financial year. FedEx Freight will continue to provide freight transportation services as a stand-alone company under the Federal Express Corp banner. REUTERS

Ford and Stellantis Models Will Get Lower Tax Credits
Ford and Stellantis said Wednesday that tax credits for most of their electric and plug-in electric hybrid models will be halved to $ 3,750 on April 18 after new U.S. Treasury rules take effect. Congress mandated the rules in August as part of a $ 430 billion climate bill. China dominates the supply chains of products like E.V. batteries and solar panels, and the rules are aimed at moving U.S. battery production and supply chains away from China. Out of six Ford vehicles, just the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring will still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit. The other models currently getting credits -- Ford Mustang Mach-E, Ford E-Transit, Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid and Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring -- will see credits drop to $ 3,750. Stellantis said of its three plugin hybrid electric models, its Chrysler Pacifica plug-in electric hybrid will qualify for $ 7,500 tax credits after April 18, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe qualify for just $ 3,750.

Walmart Will Slow Hiring As It Turns to Automation
Walmart said on Wednesday that inflation would continue to pressure its business this year, and that it would slow hiring as it builds out automation technology. The company said inflation continued to affect business as shoppers add more lower-margin groceries to their carts over highermargin apparel and home goods. It also said it expected about twothirds of its stores to be serviced by automation within three years, and reduce costs taken to process a package by 20 percent. Last month, Reuters reported that hundreds of workers were let go at facilities that fulfill orders placed on Walmart.com. Automation will also help the company prevent inventory buildup, which happened last year when food and gas prices sharply increased. Automation will "get us closer to inventory optimization than ever before," Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, said. REUTERS

Full text: In Ben Affleck's enjoyable movie, Matt Damon stars as the Nike exec who's trying to sign a young Michael Jordan. But first he must contend with Viola Davis.
It's ridiculous how entertaining "Air" is given that it's about shoes, even if it works overtime to persuade you that it's also about other, nobler truths, too. Mind you, the pair that Nike presented to Michael Jordan in a 1984 meeting were custom. The company wanted badly to sign Jordan to an endorsement deal, so it created black-and-red high tops with a white midsole and a multimillion-dollar sweetener. Jordan may have preferred Adidas, but he soon laced up for Nike, changing footwear, sports stardom and athletic marketing forever.
Directed by Ben Affleck, the frothily amusing and very eager-to-please "Air" tells the oft-told tale of how Nike signed Jordan to a contract that made each astonishingly rich. Yet while the man and the money are inevitably central to this deeply American story, both remain strategically obscured. Jordan (Damian Young) is shown only in teasing partial view, his face concealed (you see the real Jordan in archival images), an initially distracting decision that grows less gimmicky and seems more natural as the story shifts focus toward virtuous, less fungible human values like love, genius, grit, perseverance, righteousness and faith.
The movie's principal true believer is Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon). (Like most of the main characters, Vaccaro is based on, and named after, a real person, though the actual Sonny is far juicier than he is here.) A vision in beige with a beeper attached to his belt, his belly spilling over that same belt, Sonny is a familiar, cartoonish sad-sack, a figure right out of Mike Judge's "Office Space." He's divorced and still unattached, and his workaholic habits don't bode well for romance. He routinely buys his nightly dinner at the local convenience store, making small talk with the clerk, then eats alone while staring at the TV or, in his case, side-by-side sets.
The story heats up when Sonny and his colleagues at Nike start looking at the latest N.B.A. draftees to sign. Nike doesn't want to spend much, so most of its execs are scouring the lower picks. But Sonny has a gift for spotting talent, and he's aiming high: Jordan, the 21-year-old who's left college early and whose moves he studies on smeary tape. Not everyone can read the future or see talent like Sonny, and much of the movie involves his wooing of two notably different dealmakers and breakers: Phil Knight (an amusing Affleck), Nike's preening co-founder and chief executive, and Jordan's mother, Deloris (a sensational Viola Davis).
Written by Alex Convery, "Air" nicely hits the sweet spot between light comedy and lighter drama that's tough to get right. It's funny, but its generous laughs tend to be low-key and are more often dependent on their delivery than on the actual writing. Damon is crucial to selling the humor. He's packed on weight for the role, and he gives the character a stolid, tamped-down physicality, but he also lets you see the eddies of anger and frustration raging under the character's skin. Sonny is put-upon and dejected, but he's quick witted and doesn't suffer fools (or Knight), and his patience has already been worn perilously thin when the story opens.
Waiting for Sonny to explode helps build the comic tension; watching him try to sign Jordan creates the relatively less punchy drama. Some of the juiciest laughs come from Sonny's interactions with the gnomic Knight, a showboating supporting role that Affleck embraces with a sly, vacant deadpan and tragically unhip styling. Affleck knows how to steal scenes, and he pilfers a few, but he's a very good and generous director of actors. He's loaded up "Air" with terrific supporting players, including Jason Bateman and Chris Tucker, who, as Nike suits, add distinct flavor and some brilliant contrapuntal timing to the mix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Along with Damon, the movie's other M.V.P. is Davis, whose beautifully modulated performance helps deepen the story and expand its emotional palette. Davis is often called on to go big in her roles, to let the emotion and snot flow, so it's a pleasure watching her hold back and change it up with lapidary, minimalist precision. Like Damon, she gives her character a palpable physical solidity, but Deloris is entirely comfortable, at ease in her body and in the world, and she's in charge. You only read her face when she wants. Michael is the star of this world, but it's Deloris who exerts the family's greatest gravitational force.
Affleck handles all the story's many parts gracefully, mostly by keeping them continually spinning. There's a lot of walking-and-talking both in offices and in halls, which never gets dull largely because of who's doing the walking and talking. What they're chattering about is critical, even if the movie has distilled the hard-charging, world-shifting, sometimes (oftentimes!) ethically challenged business of professional sports into a group of really nice, funny, well-meaning personalities and one not-as-nice agent, David Falk (Chris Messina), a trash-talking, phone-smashing, profane motormouth right out of HBO's "Entourage."
"Air" is enjoyably facile and light as a feather, though sometimes touching, never more so than in a late, deftly handled face-off between Sonny and Deloris that brings the larger racial stakes of the landmark deal into crystalline focus. Here, as elsewhere, the movie deviates from the historical record -- including the sometimes divergent, widely published accounts -- to make a richer, heftier, more meaningful story. As Affleck cuts back and forth between Sonny and Deloris, filling the screen with close-ups that let you track every rivulet of emotion, it's hard not to be moved, including by the sight of these exceptional actors who, with heart and talent, ever so briefly turn a story about capitalism into a referendum on the soul of a nation.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new company, with the stock ticker "TKO," is betting that the value of rights for live events like wrestling will continue to soar.
The tens of thousands of fans who crowded into SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles for WrestleMania this weekend got to watch the wrestling icon John Cena be hurled to the canvas by Austin Theory, one of World Wrestling Entertainment's biggest stars.
Offstage, bankers and executives huddled in conference suites at the stadium to put the finishing touches on a new plot for W.W.E.'s future. Endeavor, an entertainment colossus run by the Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel, was finalizing a deal to acquire W.W.E. and merge it with Ultimate Fighting Championship, the combat sports league Endeavor owns.
News of the deal, which aims to create a new public company worth more than $ 21 billion, broke Sunday before the second night of WrestleMania, with Mr. Emanuel in attendance alongside Vince McMahon, the executive chairman of W.W.E. The companies officially announced the deal Monday morning, saying the as-yet unnamed firm -- whose stock will trade under the symbol "TKO" -- would be a juggernaut in live entertainment and combat sports.
The deal is expected to close near the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Endeavor would own 51 percent of the company and existing W.W.E. shareholders would control 49 percent.
"Must-watch TV is a rarity these days," said Mark Shapiro, Endeavor's president and chief operating officer, who will also have those roles at the new company. "And unicorns like the U.F.C. and W.W.E. will be heavily in demand."
In fusing Ultimate Fighting Championship with World Wrestling Entertainment, Mr. Emanuel and Mr. McMahon are betting that traditional TV companies and video-streaming giants will continue to pay top dollar for the rights to show live events -- including scripted and unscripted fights.
The National Football League in December struck an agreement with YouTube TV that values its Sunday Ticket package of games at as much as $ 2.5 billion annually -- an increase of about $ 1 billion from the deal with its previous partner, DirecTV. The National Basketball Association is expecting to sharply increase its fees after its TV agreements expire following the 2024-25 season.
The intense competition between cable TV and deep-pocketed tech companies is behind the ballooning costs. As viewers abandon traditional television, live events like N.F.L. games and W.W.E. matches continue to draw big ratings, helping anchor the cable TV business. And tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet are using live sports to draw new subscribers to their services, creating a bidding war for rights.
Executives aim to use the tie-up of W.W.E. and U.F.C. to take advantage of that demand. U.F.C.'s contract with the Walt Disney Company's ESPN division ends in the next few years, and W.W.E.'s deals with NBCUniversal's USA Network and the Fox broadcast network are set to expire next year.
Shares of W.W.E. and Endeavor traded lower on Monday, with W.W.E. down about 2 percent and Endeavor down about 6 percent at market close. Brandon Ross, an analyst for LightShed Partners, said prices were fluctuating based on investor expectations for the value of the upcoming rights renegotiations.
"Shareholders are currently trying to determine how they see these rights renewals working out in an environment that has been good to sports rights holders but is difficult overall," he said.
The combination is the latest in a series of audacious deals struck by Mr. Emanuel, the workaholic Hollywood talent agent who rose from the mailroom to become one of the entertainment industry's most important figures. Mr. Emanuel will be the chief executive of the new company and will keep his chief executive title at Endeavor, which will continue to own other businesses, including the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the Professional Bull Riding league.
The deal also provides a coda to a tumultuous chapter in Mr. McMahon's career. He was reinstated as executive chairman of W.W.E. in January after resigning from that position last year following an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment. Mr. McMahon will stay on at the new company as executive chairman, part of an 11-person board that will include six members from Endeavor and five members from W.W.E.
The Wall Street Journal reported last June that Mr. McMahon agreed to pay a secret $ 3 million settlement to an employee with whom he was said to have had an affair, and that the board had been investigating since April last year. The investigation unearthed other nondisclosure agreements involving claims of misconduct by Mr. McMahon.
Mr. McMahon acknowledged the harassment claims in an interview on Monday from Endeavor's Los Angeles offices.
"I've made mistakes in my 50-year career, both in business and personally, and I've always owned up to them," he said.
Mr. Emanuel said that he believed in "due process," adding that Mr. McMahon "takes full responsibility for what happened."
Dana White, the president of U.F.C., will keep that role at the combined company, and Nick Khan, the chief executive of W.W.E., will stay on as president. Patrick Whitesell, the prominent Hollywood executive and agent who represents actors including Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, will remain executive chairman of Endeavor.
Stephanie McMahon, Mr. McMahon's daughter and the former co-chief executive of W.W.E., will not have a role at W.W.E. after the deal, Mr. McMahon said, but Paul Levesque -- W.W.E.'s chief content officer also known by his wrestling name, "Triple H" -- will continue to work in that capacity.
The deal puts a hefty valuation on U.F.C., which Endeavor and its backers purchased for about $ 4 billion in 2016, and W.W.E., which was seeking about $ 9 billion in a deal. The all-stock deal values U.F.C. at $ 12.1 billion and W.W.E. at $ 9.3 billion. Mr. Shapiro said that the competitive sale process W.W.E. ran justified its "healthy price."
In the interview, Mr. Emanuel was enthusiastic about the possibility of creating shows and movies from W.W.E. characters, calling them "superheroes."
Mr. Emanuel described the company's intellectual property rights as "some of the greatest I.P. in the world." Endeavor is also betting the price tag will be justified by businesses other than rights, like selling sponsorships, creating new events and striking deals with social media companies Mr. Shapiro said.
The deal for W.W.E. came together quickly. Over the past several weeks, Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Shapiro visited W.W.E.'s headquarters in Stamford, Conn., and the offices of Raine, an investment bank in New York to finalize the details. On Sunday, as WrestleMania reached its conclusion, Endeavor and W.W.E. pinned down the final details.
Although Mr. Emanuel was one of the inspirations for the super-agent Ari Gold on the HBO show "Entourage," he said he wasn't likely to appear as a character in the W.W.E.'s story universe in the way that Mr. McMahon has.
"I'm a character already in my own mind," Mr. Emanuel said. "I don't need to share that with anybody."

Apple Takes On Classical Music: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company says it has a fix for the unwieldy world of classical streaming. But it's unclear how much traction a stand-alone app can get.
In the streaming era, fans of classical music have had reason to grumble.
It can be hard for veteran listeners to find what they want on platforms like Spotify, Tidal, Amazon and YouTube, which are optimized for pop music fans searching for the latest by Taylor Swift or Beyoncé. And for curious newcomers, it can be difficult to get beyond algorithmic loops of Pachelbel's "Canon in D Major" and Mozart's "Rondo Alla Turca."
Apple last week released a stand-alone app meant to address these problems. The app, known as Apple Music Classical, features a refined search engine, a sleek interface and a host of features aimed at making classical music more accessible, including beginners' guides to different musical eras and commentary from marquee artists like the violinist Hilary Hahn and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma.
Apple hopes that the app, which has been in development since 2021, when the company acquired Primephonic, a classical streaming start-up in Amsterdam, will attract die-hard classical fans and new listeners alike. But it remains unclear how much traction the app can get in a crowded streaming market, in which Apple competes with behemoths like Spotify as well as dedicated classical services like Idagio.
"This is just the beginning," Oliver Schusser, a vice president at Apple, said in an interview, adding that Apple would continue to improve and build the app's database. "We're really serious about this."
I spent a few days putting Apple Music Classical to the test, trying out its search, playlists and guides to classical music. (The app is currently available only on iPhone, though an Android version is in the works; at the moment, there is no desktop version.) Here are my impressions.
Cutting Through the Metadata
For pop music, a listing of artist, track and album is generally sufficient. But in classical, there are more nuances in the metadata: composer, work, soloist, ensemble, instrument, conductor, movement and nickname (like Beethoven's "Emperor" concerto or Mahler's "Resurrection" symphony).
Apple has amassed 50 million such data points, the company says, in the app -- encompassing some 20,000 composers, 117,000 works, 350,000 movements and five million tracks -- and its search function generally feels more intuitive than its rivals.
On many streaming platforms, I have struggled to find Rachmaninoff's recordings of his compositions. A search for his name on Spotify, for example, returns a disorderly display of his most popular works, such as "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini," performed by a wide variety of artists.
But on Apple Music Classical, it is easier to quickly locate his recordings because the app can distinguish between Rachmaninoff the composer and Rachmaninoff the pianist or conductor. The search function is not perfect; a Rachmaninoff track by the Chinese pianist Niu Niu also shows up in the mix of recordings by Rachmaninoff. But the app makes it much easier to hunt down specific pieces of music.
A Sprawling Collection
Apple Music Classical has a clean and inviting interface that mimics the main Apple Music app. But it still struggles with a problem that has long vexed classical streaming: the sheer volume of the catalog.
A search for Verdi's "Aida," for example, turns up an eye-popping 1,330 recordings. Apple has tried to make it easier to navigate a sprawling list like that. A page for "Aida," for example, has a brief description of the opera, an "editor's choice" recording (Antonio Pappano and the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia) and five of the most frequently played versions.
But it can still feel overwhelming. It helps to know exactly what you're looking for: the list can be searched, scrolled or sorted by popularity, name, release date or duration. If you're interested in recordings of "Aida" featuring Leontyne Price in the title role, for example, you can type in "Leontyne" and find her performances under the baton of Erich Leinsdorf, Georg Solti, Thomas Schippers and others.
Opera can be especially difficult to navigate on streaming platforms because of long lists of cast members. While Apple comprehensively lists singers on each track, it can be hard to figure out quickly who the stars are when perusing albums. This could be fixed through more consistent album descriptions, or an option to enlarge album covers to make the words more legible. And while Apple has introduced the ability to search by lyrics for pop songs, no such feature exists in classical yet.
Apple makes the vastness of the classical repertoire more manageable through inventive playlists, which help resurface celebrated recordings. These playlists cover a variety of genres, including opera, Renaissance music, art song and minimalism. There are also lists for composers, including the usual suspects -- Bach, Mozart, Beethoven -- as well as contemporary artists like Kaija Saariaho and Steve Reich. "Hidden Gems" highlights overlooked albums ("Breaking Waves," a compilation of flute music by Swedish women, for instance, or "Consolation: Forgotten Treasures of the Ukrainian Soul"). "Composers Undiscovered" showcases lesser-known works by prominent composers, like Beethoven's Scottish songs.
Attracting Newcomers
Apple hopes the app will help draw new listeners to classical music, and many features are aimed at shedding its elitist image.
On the home screen, the app offers a nine-part introduction called "The Story of Classical," described as a guide to the "weird and wonderful world of classical music." The series takes listeners from the Baroque to the 21st century, with forays further back, into medieval and Renaissance music.
A series called "Track by Track" features commentary by renowned artists, including Hahn and Ma. The cellist Abel Selaocoe, introducing an album of pieces by Bach and South African and Tanzanian folk songs, describes how hymnal music from England and the Netherlands mixed with African culture. The pianist Víkingur Olafsson talks about feeling naked onstage when he plays Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16, "a piece we all have to face as pianists."
Part of Apple's mission appears to be to help elevate overlooked artists, particularly women and people of color. For example, a tab of composers begins with Beethoven, Bach and Mozart but then expands to Clara Schumann, Caroline Shaw and Errollyn Wallen, as well as William Grant Still.
The pianist Alice Sara Ott and the conductor Karina Canellakis are featured on an exclusive recording of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic.
While using the app on a recent morning, I encountered the music of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th-century Benedictine nun and composer of Gregorian chants. Hildegard, I soon discovered, is something of a star on the app, where she is described as a scientist, mystic, writer and philosopher and sits adjacent to Tchaikovsky on a composer roster. (Many of the great composers have been given enhanced digital portraits as part of Apple's efforts to make them more realistic; Hildegard is shown in a habit, with a piercing stare.)
Hildegard's music could easily be lost in the chaos of streaming. But in the Apple universe, it gets fresh life.

Number of Remote Workers Is Debated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Labor Department numbers indicate that fewer Americans worked remotely last year. But many experts criticize the government's data collection.
Millions of workers, employers, square feet of real estate and dollars of downtown economic retail are wrapped up in the question of how many people are working from home -- yet there remain large discrepancies in how remote work is measured.
The Labor Department, last week, released data indicating a decline in remote work: 72.5 percent of businesses said their employees rarely or never teleworked last year, up from 60.1 percent in 2021 and quite close to the 76.7 percent that had no such work before the pandemic. But while the Labor Department found that remote work was almost back to prepandemic levels, many other surveys show it is up four- to fivefold.
Outside research, including a monthly survey of workers from researchers at Stanford University and the Census Bureau's household survey, indicate that remote work remains prevalent, with Stanford's finding that it accounts for over a quarter of paid full-time workdays in the United States, just slightly down from 33 percent in 2021. Some scholars suggested that the Labor Department's survey may overcount fully in-person work, though the comparisons among the various surveys aren't direct.
"I see this survey as an outlier and not the most reliable measure," said Adam Ozimek, chief economist of the Economic Innovation Group, a public policy organization, describing the Labor Department's survey. "We need to think hard as we try to develop better measures of working from home."
Remote work is having profound effects on nearly every dimension of the economy: foot traffic to downtown businesses, housing markets in big cities and far-flung areas, methods of assessing productivity and child care. Public transportation ridership sank during the pandemic, and suburban real estate values rose.
Nearly one billion square feet of office real estate was available but in search of a tenant at the end of 2022. People refashioned their lives and routines, working 28 percent more after traditional hours, according to Microsoft.
The stakes of measuring remote work's prevalence are high. And researchers said the wording of the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on remote work, which was distributed to businesses, might have caused some confusion among respondents.
"Telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to work at home, or from another remote location, by using the internet or a computer linked to one's place of employment, as well as digital communications, such as email and phone," the survey read. "Do any employees at this location CURRENTLY telework in any amount?"
By defining telework so broadly -- as any worker sending an email or making a call outside the office -- the Labor Department's survey question should most likely have turned up a fully in-person figure lower than the one released last week, said Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, suggesting that some businesses may have been confused by the question.
This particular Labor Department figure on telework also combines fully remote work with hybrid arrangements. But hybrid work has eclipsed fully remote policies, with just over half of the workers who can do their jobs from home combining in-person and remote work, according to Gallup.
A spokeswoman for the Labor Department said the survey most likely did not reflect informal work-from-home arrangements.
"Taking into account that the self-employed and the public sector are not included in the sample, and that this is a survey of establishments rather than individuals, our estimates do not appear out of line with other estimates," the spokeswoman said.
Stanford's monthly study on working from home, which surveys 10,000 workers across cities and industries, found that 27 percent of paid full-time days were worked from home in early 2023.
Much of that remote work came from hybrid setups. Last month, the survey found that 12 percent of workers were fully remote, roughly 60 percent fully in person and 28 percent hybrid.
Other sources of data confirm that working-from-home patterns remain entrenched in certain industries. The building security firm Kastle, for example, tracks data on office badge swipes and reported this month that offices remained at roughly 48 percent of their prepandemic occupancy.
A closer look at New York, from the Partnership for New York City, found that 52 percent of Manhattan office workers were working in person on an average day at the start of this year, up from 49 percent in September. But only 9 percent of employees were in the office five days a week, underscoring the reach of hybrid arrangements. And Square, the retail technology company, which tracks payments at food and drink establishments, found that sales growth at bars and restaurants in Brooklyn had recently outpaced growth of those in Manhattan.
"It's clear that the work-from-home trends induced by the pandemic have transformed the food and drink scene in the city," said Ara Kharazian, an economist at Square.
The Partnership for New York City's data indicated that financial service firms were back in the office in greater numbers than many other companies. Financial service firms reported 59 percent daily office attendance in late January, according to the partnership. The tech industry, by contrast, was at 43 percent.
All this data is emerging as hundreds of companies formalize their policies on hybrid work, with many trying to persuade their employees to spend more time at the office.
Amazon told corporate workers last month that they had to be in the office three days a week starting in May, and Starbucks called its 3,750 corporate workers back three days a week as well. Disney asked employees to return to the office four days a week. Its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, cited the need for in-person creative collaborations.
Other chief executives have also begun to question the merits of remote work. Even Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which told all its employees that they could go permanently remote, began voicing concern this year that productivity among some employees has been lower.
As executives clamp down on in-person work, worker resistance has become more vocal. At Amazon, more than 29,000 employees joined a Slack channel, called Remote Advocacy, protesting the shift to in-person work. At Starbucks, more than 40 corporate employees signed an open letter opposing the new return-to-office policy.
Wherever people are doing the jobs they already have, mostly in person per the Labor Department or over a quarter of the time at home per others, one metric does indicate that hybrid work is here to stay: job postings.
A study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and other institutions analyzing over 50 million job postings last month found that postings explicitly mentioning remote work are at 12.2 percent -- a fourfold increase since before the pandemic.

Full text: What's Up? (March 26-April 1)
Silicon Valley Bank Changes Hands
First Citizens BancShares, a family-run bank in North Carolina, announced last Sunday that it was acquiring Silicon Valley Bank, capping off a tumultuous month for the California lender whose collapse touched off a wider banking crisis. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized control of SVB and its assets on March 10, after a run on deposits left it insolvent, and SVB filed for bankruptcy a week later. First Citizens' deal with the F.D.I.C. to take over the bank involved the purchase of about $ 72 billion in loans at a $ 16.5 billion discount. First Citizens also took control of all of the bank's roughly $ 56 billion in deposits. But an additional $ 90 billion in SVB's securities remain under the purview of the F.D.I.C. The collapse of SVB was followed in short succession by two other bank failures. Credit Suisse, which was bought by its rival UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, and Signature Bank. New York Community Bancorp later acquired substantially all of the remaining deposits at Signature Bank.
And in Other SVB News
At a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, federal regulators blamed the banks' executives for poor management and risk assessment, which, they argued, led to the collapses. They also suggested bank managers could face penalties if they did anything improper. But the regulators themselves were not off the hook: They were the ones in the hot seat on Tuesday, answering questions from lawmakers about why certain red flags went unheeded and how to avoid future bank failures. The Federal Reserve, in particular, is under scrutiny for not doing enough to prevent the banks' implosions. Michael S. Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, said he learned about SVB's problems only in February. These lines of questioning are expected to continue this week, when the House Financial Services Committee holds its own hearing on Wednesday.
Not the Usual Treatment
Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, did not get the treatment he was used to receiving in Washington on Wednesday when he appeared before a committee, led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, scrutinizing him for what lawmakers termed "illegal union busting." In the past, Democrats praised Mr. Schultz for his business practices, but last week liberal members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions pressed the longtime chief executive with questions about whether he had participated in decisions to fire or discipline workers involved in the union drive at Starbucks. Lawmakers said they had heard of "widespread anti-union efforts" at the company, but Mr. Schultz called those accusations "propaganda" and instead highlighted Starbucks's pay and benefits for workers.
What's Next? (April 2-8)
Taking the Labor Market's Temperature
Recent job reports took many analysts by surprise, blowing past expectations and breaking a trend line that had suggested the jobs market was gradually cooling off. Forecasters were going into Friday's jobs report with similar expectations -- the consensus was that employers added 240,000 jobs in March. But it's unclear how closely the new data will conform to those predictions. Even amid high-profile layoff announcements at companies like Amazon and NPR, jobless claims remain low. And though the banking crisis has fomented concerns about the economic outlook -- and darkened the forecast for later this year -- its hasn't yet had an effect on jobs figures.
The I.R.S.'s Cash Infusion
The Internal Revenue Service is expected to release its plan this week for how to manage the $ 80 billion the Biden administration has allocated to overhaul the agency, which has struggled in recent years with an enormous tax return backlog, staffing shortages, outdated technology and a lack of funding. But shoring up the I.R.S. has become a partisan issue, with Republicans fervently opposed to aiding the agency, which they argue would give it too much power over taxpayers. Of new concern to conservatives in Congress, as well as lobbyists for the tax preparation industry, is a potential plan for the I.R.S. to create its own tax-filing system that would allow taxpayers to submit their returns directly to the federal government at no cost.
Trump's Arraignment
Former President Donald J. Trump is likely to be arraigned on Tuesday after a grand jury in Manhattan voted last week to indict him for his role in paying hush money to an adult film star during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. In the immediate aftermath of the indictment, users on social media channels associated with right-wing extremists and conspiracy theorists searched for an explanation for why Mr. Trump met this fate. But the responses did not coalesce around any one narrative or call to action: Although some urged their fellow Trump supporters to rise to the former president's defense, others suggested it would be best to wait until more was known about the indictment and argued an indictment would help him win re-election in 2024.
What Else?
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge cooled to 5 percent on an annual basis in February. New rules released on Friday by the Treasury Department significantly limit the electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Detroit automakers report their March sales figures this week, which will show how the Fed's interest rate increases have affected demand for vehicles.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fate of the S&P 500 index -- used by investors as a barometer for the health of corporate America, and cited by presidents as a measure of their handling of the economy -- often comes down to just two companies: Apple and Microsoft.
This means it's hard to invest in the U.S. stock market, such as through a 401(k) or pension plan, and not be highly dependent on the fate of the two tech giants. More than $ 15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft's and Apple's market valuation.
It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath.
Trading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of a global investment bank in Europe sent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy, the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5 percent.
Apple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent.
It can be jarring for investors to see the index perform so differently from what they may have predicted, said Fiona Cincotta, a stock market analyst at StoneX, a brokerage.
"It's phenomenal that two companies can direct so much power within the S&P 500," she said. "These two companies seem to have been single-handedly directing the index."
It was true even at the height of the frenzy. On Monday, March 13, immediately after the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, signs of panic were everywhere: Several regional banks suffered their worst day ever in the stock market, with First Republic Bank down more than 60 percent, in conditions so chaotic that trading in many individual stocks was halted as stock exchanges tried to limit the damage.
Outside the stock market, government bond yields went haywire, oil prices slid and the dollar weakened, all showing that alarms about the economy were ringing on trading desks around the world.
Yet the S&P 500 spent much of the day in positive territory, and it ended with a barely noticeable decline of 0.1 percent. Credit, again, goes to Microsoft and Apple, which both rose enough to counter a 15 percent slide in the entire regional banking sector that day.
Much of this comes down to how the S&P 500 is designed. Its value is calculated by a measure that considers the overall market capitalization of a company. It means the stock moves of the largest companies carry the greatest weight, because even slight changes in their value create or destroy billions of dollars of shareholder value.
Apple, at roughly $ 2.4 trillion, and Microsoft, at $ 2.1 trillion, are so large that, taken together, the two companies would be the third-largest sector of the index, behind tech and health care. They would be larger than the energy sector and roughly the size of the financials sector.
This influence is a result of a decades-long shift in both the markets and the economy since the dot-com boom, a change that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates put in place to support the economy after the Great Recession made borrowing cheap and pushed investors to seek out higher returns from riskier companies, spurring financing and growth for tech companies. Apple and Microsoft excelled.
Apple in 2018 became the first American company valued at more than $ 1 trillion on the stock market. As its value inflated, so did that of its rivals Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) -- a group that came to be called the FANG stocks. They helped to lift the index to new highs over a more than decade-long bull market. Since then, Apple and Microsoft have become proportionally much larger, more than twice the size of the next largest company.
This dynamic is not wholly unusual in the history of the S&P 500, though it is extreme, and it has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of some tech companies through the pandemic. (At the end of 2018, Microsoft's and Apple's combined index weight was less than Apple's is today on its own.) The previous company to reach Microsoft's 6.2 percent weight in the index was IBM in the mid-80s, based on data for the end of each calendar year.
"I don't think it's a problem," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. "This is what the whole thing is worth, and if Apple or Microsoft go up or down, there is proportional impact because they are worth more. It's market-driven."
The S&P also produces an "equal weight" index, where each stock has the same effect on the wider group. In March, that index fell 2.6 percent.
Another commonly cited measure of Wall Street's performance, the Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index that has been criticized for how it emphasizes companies based on their share price alone.
And then there are the underlying sectors, which are also tracked in separate indexes by S&P. These indexes, which tend to more directly show pain afflicting their subsets of stocks, show that the financial sector fell almost 10 percent in March, while energy stocks dropped 0.5 percent and real estate companies slid 2.1 percent. They also show that other parts of the market -- like utilities -- fared just fine.
"There were so many sectors that underperformed and were in the red across the month, and that was completely pushed over and overshadowed by the gains in big tech," Ms. Cincotta said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the S&P 500 as well as the Dow, has tried to address the impact of these specific weightings, at least on different sectors. In 2018, it moved Alphabet and Meta out of the tech sector and into the communications category with Netflix, while leaving Amazon in the consumer discretionary category with other retailers.
Since then, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have slowly lost value, while Apple and Microsoft have grown. The technology sector in the S&P 500 has also been bolstered by the emergence of new behemoths like the chip maker Nvidia, which is valued around three quarters of a trillion dollars.
This month, S&P sought to rebalance the index again, moving a handful of large tech-oriented companies -- like Visa and PayPal -- into the financials sector, but further entrenching Apple and Microsoft's dominance as the two tech heavyweights.
Of course, this cuts both ways. In 2022, the S&P 500 slumped close to 20 percent, a drop that would have been much smaller without the lousy performance of the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft together accounted for roughly one-fifth of the index's total decline last year.
But for now, analysts see reasons for tech to continue to rally.
One reason is the excitement over artificial intelligence. Microsoft has a large stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and many investors foresee the nascent technology driving the next phase of growth for the companies developing the software as well as the chip makers whose processors power it.
Tech stocks are also benefiting from the concern over the country's banks, which has led investors to quickly cut back their expectation for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates, and absent an imminent recession, lower rates in the future would be a boost for the sector.
And, analysts said, large technology companies have become havens where investors can wait out the current storm.
"It's been a big bull cycle for tech," said George Catrambone, the head of Americas trading at DWS, a fund manager. "I don't think people will give up that paradigm easily."

Wall Street Gains as Banking Fears Recede: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose Thursday as a bit more fear evaporated from Wall Street, keeping its main index of health on track for a winning month.
The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent for its fifth gain in the last six days. It's been on a sharp turnaround after struggling in earlier weeks on worries about whether the banking system was cracking under the weight of higher interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.7 percent.
Forceful actions by regulators worldwide have helped build confidence that the current trouble for banks won't torpedo the economy like the 2008 financial crisis did. Traders have also begun betting heavily that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates soon. Such cuts could offer relief after a year of relentless hikes to rates, and they also tend to act like steroids for markets.
To be sure, all the recent ebullience has some professionals on Wall Street wary.
"Markets are pricing the best of both worlds: a recession that brings inflation down rapidly and keeps rates low, yet one where corporate earnings do not fall sharply," according to analysts at Barclays led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research.
They are skeptical and think both bonds and U.S. stocks look too expensive.
Since Silicon Valley Bank became history's second-biggest U.S. bank failure, Treasury yields in the bond market have tumbled as traders built bets the Federal Reserve would have to take it easier on interest rates.
The Fed has pulled its key overnight rate to a range of 4.75 percent to 5 percent, up from virtually zero at the start of last year, to drive down inflation. High rates can do that, but only by taking a blunt hammer to the entire economy. They also drag down prices for stocks and other investments.
The bet on Wall Street has been that the Fed may cut rates as soon as this summer, to release some of the pressure built up on the economy and banks. That has caused the price to soar and the yield to tumble for the two-year Treasury, which tends to move on expectations for Fed action.
Its yield plunged from above 5 percent earlier this month, when it was at its highest level since 2007, back below 3.6 percent last week. That's a massive move for the bond market. It rose Thursday to 4.12 percent from 4.11 percent late Wednesday.
Expectations for easier rates in turn have helped to buoy the Big Tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500 and other indexes. That's because tech and high-growth stocks are seen as some of the biggest beneficiaries of low rates.
Gains for Microsoft, Apple and Amazon on Thursday were the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher. Amazon rose 1.7 percent, while the others were up more modestly.
But many professionals on Wall Street are saying the Fed would likely cut rates only if a more serious recession for the economy were on the way, one that would pull down corporate earnings even more sharply than what's already expected.
The Fed has indicated it plans to raise rates one more time before holding steady through the end of this year. While it has acknowledged that the turmoil for banks could almost act like a rate hike on its own, inflation is still high.
"In sharp recessions -- which seems to us the only way to justify bond market pricing, given how high US inflation is -- corporate earnings easily drop 30-35 percent," Mr. Rajadhyaksha and his Barclays colleagues wrote in a report. They added that Big Tech stocks would not be immune from such a downturn.
Nevertheless, the increasingly dominant force on Wall Street seems to be calm.
Financial stocks in the S&P 500 went from gains in the morning to losses in the afternoon. The movements weren't as jagged as they were earlier this month when fears about the banking system were at their height.

Full text: The British experimental theater company Complicité turns the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk's novel "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead" into a thought-provoking, entertaining spectacle.
Some books lend themselves to stage adaptation more than others, and the experimental theater company Complicité has a strong track record of turning awkward novels into plays. The British troupe, led by the director Simon McBurney, has already created acclaimed productions from Mikhail Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita" and Max Porter's "Grief Is the Thing With Feathers."
Complicité's latest show is a suitably idiosyncratic treatment of "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead," the surreal eco-thriller by the Polish author and Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk. It runs at the Barbican Theater in London through April 1, then tours Britain before playing at some major European venues and festivals, including the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, and the Odéon -- Théâtre de l'Europe in Paris.
Tokarczuk's novel revolves around a series of grisly murders in a remote village in southern Poland. The narrator-protagonist, Janina, a semiretired teacher and passionate animal lover in her 60s, takes a keen interest in the case, pestering the local police force with her unsolicited insights and pushing a bizarre theory that, since all the victims were avid hunters or poachers, the murders must have been carried out by animals as an act of revenge. Along the way she holds forth on animal cruelty, astrology and her love of the English poet William Blake.
Complicité's decision to foreground these freewheeling digressions is to be commended: This is not a conventional whodunit but, rather, a kind of fable. The production's blend of philosophical purpose and irreverent humor rings true to the book's spirit, and makes for an entertaining and thought-provoking spectacle.
The spine of the play is a spotlit monologue by Janina, who dips in and out of the action as it unfolds around her. Amanda Hadingue -- standing in for Kathryn Hunter, who has been unwell -- brings a disarmingly self-effacing grace to the lead role, ensuring Janina retains the audience's sympathy, even as she rails abrasively against the industrial slaughter of animals, the hypocrisy of organized religion and the unquestioning passivity of her fellow townspeople.
Indeed, the entire production is delivered with a playful esprit that borders on the pantomimic: Self-important cops are played for laughs, as is the supercilious local priest; there are charming cameos from animals played by humans -- a dog here, a fox there; and César Sarachu almost steals the show in a wonderfully droll performance as Janina's endearingly hapless neighbor, Oddball.
Interiority is the perennial challenge when adapting literary novels for stage or screen. A slick 2017 movie adaptation of "Drive Your Plow" called "Spoor," by the Polish director Agnieszka Holland, rendered it as a straight-up nor thriller. It was well wrought but inevitably one-dimensional: Janina's distinctive narrative voice, which treads a fine line between eccentric and downright cranky, is integral to the novel's charm; the story feels flat without it. Complicité's adaptation neatly sidesteps this problem by juxtaposing the inner and outer worlds in a way that feels lively and dynamic.
McBurney, the director, is known for his exuberant use of audiovisual effects, and his team have conjured an impressive sensory texture here. A big screen at the rear of the stage displays eye-catching images that complement the action. Some are scene-setting, such as snowy landscapes evoking the bitterly cold Polish winter; others, such as a series of detailed drawings of horoscope charts, are thematic.
Richard Skelton's atmospheric score alternates between brooding suspense and doleful solemnity, though the sound designer Christopher Shutt is maybe a little too trigger-happy with the sudden loud noises: I feared for some of the older theatregoers, but it certainly kept the audience alert.
Rae Smith's costume design is understatedly on point: Janina pads around in a jarringly mismatched sports-casual ensemble that is precisely the kind of thing an unabashed eccentric might wear, and the local huntsmen look appropriately forbidding in their uniformly dark puffer jackets.
Clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, "Drive Your Plow" is a bit too long. A subplot about Janina's unspecified chronic illness ("my ailments") could perhaps have been significantly abridged, or even cut, to give the play a zippier feel. But its shortcomings are essentially those of the novel: its single-track didacticism; its neat pitting of romantic idealists against macho, insentient normies; and the fact that a decisive plot twist can be spotted a mile off.
Complicité is no stranger to politics: "The Encounter," adapted in 2016 from a novel by the Romanian-American author Petru Popescu, addressed environmental destruction in the Amazon; the company's 2015 children's play "Lionboy" touched on the ethically dubious machinations of Big Pharma. Crucially, the company's dissident ethos extends to form as well as subject matter. "Drive Your Plow's" parable of hubris offers considerable food for thought as we continue to hurtle toward climate disaster: Janina is a Cassandra figure for the 21st century, a voice of reason doomed to be met with indifference, condescension or ridicule. The political message is deadly earnest. Thankfully, Complicité serves it up with a dose of fun.

'Pay Later' Service
By Apple Enters Market
Apple launched its buy now, pay later service in the United States on Tuesday, a move that is likely to disrupt the financial technology sector dominated by firms like Affirm Holdings and the Swedish payments company Klarna.
The service, Apple Pay Later, will allow users to split purchases into four payments spread over six weeks with no interest or fees, the company said.
Users can apply for loans between $ 50 and $ 1,000, which can be used for online and in-app purchases made on iPhones and iPads with merchants that accept Apple Pay, according to Apple.
"Apple Pay Later will absolutely wallop some of the other players," aid Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. He added that Apple Pay Later would be a disrupter as consumers looked for the easiest way to get what they wanted.
Apple Pay is accepted by over 85 percent of U.S. retailers, the company said. REUTERS

Shares of AMC Spike
On Report of Sale Interest
Shares of AMC Entertainment jumped as much as 21 percent on Tuesday after a report that Amazon was looking to buy the theater chain.
Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, has dispatched his investment advisers and top entertainment chiefs to explore acquisition plans for AMC, the entertainment industry news website The Intersect reported, citing sources familiar with the discussions. AMC's shares ended the day up 13 percent.
AMC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Amazon declined to comment.
Movie theaters are struggling to draw in crowds since the lifting of pandemic restrictions, as rising costs force people to cut spending on out-of-home entertainment and more on groceries and rent.
AMC had total long-term debt of $ 5.17 billion, according to Refinitiv data. One of the famous "meme" stocks, AMC was valued at more than $ 23 billion at the peak of the Reddit-fueled surge in June 2021.

Consumer Confidence Up
Despite Economic Worries
Consumer confidence inched up in March after two straight monthly declines, even as persistent inflation, bank collapses and anxiety over a possible recession weighed on American households.
The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 104.2 in March from 103.4 in February. Optimism about current conditions fell, though consumers grew slightly more positive about the short-term future. That's a reversal from recent surveys.
The board said that despite the uptick in confidence, the index remains below 2022′s average level of 104.5.
The board's expectations index -- a measure of consumers' six-month outlook for income, business and labor conditions -- rose in March to 73 from 70.4 in February. A reading under 80 often signals a recession in the coming year, according to the Conference Board. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Founders of Lyft Will Step Down Amid Layoffs and Disappointing Bottom Line: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lyft has been slow to bounce back from early pandemic problems even as the business of its much bigger rival, Uber, has improved.
Lyft's co-founders said on Monday that they would step down from their day-to-day responsibilities at the company, which has struggled through layoffs and disappointing financial results even as Uber, its biggest rival, has strengthened.
The founders -- Logan Green, Lyft's chief executive, and John Zimmer, its president -- will stay on the company's board of directors, they said.
After starting Lyft in 2012, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, now both 39, were high-profile personalities in its early days. They presented Lyft as a friendly alternative to Uber and its aggressive chief executive, Travis Kalanick, and avoided many of the controversies that enveloped their competitor.
Vehicles driving for Lyft were easy to spot when the company started. They often had a fuzzy, pink mustache stuck to their front grille, and Lyft passengers for a time were even encouraged to sit in the front with the driver.
But Lyft, like many other gig companies, has been unable to turn a profit despite years of fast growth, and recently has fallen further behind Uber in the ride-hailing business while failing to branch out into other areas, such as food delivery.
David Risher, the chief executive of a nonprofit called Worldreader and a member of Lyft's board, will replace Mr. Green as chief executive. Mr. Green's last day will be April 17, and he will become the chairman of the board. Mr. Zimmer will depart his current role at the end of June and become vice chair, the company said.
"As I pass the baton to David, I want to share this: We continue to have an incredible opportunity to push the boundaries on how transportation can help connect people and build a better future," Mr. Green said in a blog post.
Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer bonded over their interest in improving transportation and reducing traffic through ride-hailing services. Though the business was far smaller than Uber, they saw promise in 2017 when a campaign to delete the Uber app took off and drove interest in Lyft.
But critics have said they squandered their brief advantage, making bets that lacked ambition, like on small businesses such as scooters and bicycles.
Lyft's business has been slow to rebound from the lockdowns of the early days of pandemic, as driver supply problems have caused high prices and long waits for passengers. Lyft's stock price has dropped below $ 10, down from about $ 40 a year ago and close to $ 80 at its peak.
News of the resignations, which was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, sent the company's stock price surging in after-hours trading.
Mr. Risher, 57, was a general manager at Microsoft and a vice president at Amazon in the 1990s before founding Worldreader, which helps children get access to digital books.
"John and Logan came up with this incredible idea that really did define an entire sector years ago," he said in an interview on Monday. "And like many, many entrepreneurs, they along the way got a bunch right, and then they did some experiments that probably didn't work out in the way they expected. Then the pandemic hit, and that kind of shuffled the deck again."
The search for a new leader began late last year when Mr. Green told the board that he was considering stepping down, Mr. Risher said. Though Lyft may be an underdog to Uber, he said his company could appeal differently to customers.
"When I look at the 800-pound gorilla, I see a company that I think is very business-model driven. But we're going to be customer driven," Mr. Risher said.
Early in the pandemic, Lyft and Uber were on nearly equal footing: The vast majority of their businesses had to shut down, and they laid off many of their employees.
But Uber, which has a global presence that Lyft lacks, bounced back more quickly, partly because its worldwide availability and food delivery business kept drivers on its platform and blunted the impact of the pandemic, analysts and former employees have said.
Uber also invested more in financial incentives to persuade drivers to return to the platform after the pandemic ebbed, while Lyft did not initially have enough drivers to meet resurgent rider demand.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its employees. Then, in February, it spooked investors when its financial projections for the year fell below their expectations, sending its stock price tumbling. Lyft said at the time that it needed to lower prices to be more competitive.
Lyft did report record revenue of $ 1.2 billion in its most recent quarter -- as well as $ 588 million in losses.
Uber, on the other hand, reported $ 8.6 billion in revenue and told investors that it expected to achieve operating income profitability at some point this year, which indicated that its business was strengthening.
Tom White, a senior research analyst with the financial firm D.A. Davidson, said he considered the leadership change a "potential modest positive."
A new leader, he said in an email, "could signal increased willingness to broaden Lyft's strategic aperture a bit as it relates to other possible adjacent products (delivery?), partners or ways to create value."

TikTok's Unofficial Defender in Washington: [briefing]

Full text: Jamaal Bowman, who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester, thinks opposition to the platform is rooted in anti-China bias.
Good morning. It's Friday. We'll meet the lonely New York congressman who has become the most prominent defender of the embattled platform TikTok. We'll also look at city contracts that are turning hotels into temporary housing for some of the migrants who have arrived on buses from the southern border.
On Thursday, lawmakers in Washington blasted the chief executive of the online platform TikTok. It gained attention as a platform for viral dance videos and pop songs, but recently the U.S. government has called it a national security threat. Last week the Biden administration said it wanted TikTok's Chinese ownership to sell the app or face a possible ban.
One lawmaker in Washington has gone to bat for TikTok -- Representative Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. He maintains that the push to rein in TikTok stemmed from anti-China "hysteria." I asked my colleague Nicholas Fandos, who with David McCabe wrote about how and why Bowman became TikTok's unofficial defender in Washington, to explain.
President Biden considers TikTok a threat to national security, and that view has bipartisan support in Congress. Why has Representative Bowman become TikTok's unofficial defender?
Basically, Bowman believes that there has been a rush to judgment in Washington simply because TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.
The backdrop here is important. The United States and China are increasingly in competition and conflict with each other for global influence. President Biden and many lawmakers in both parties fear that Chinese authorities could force TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, to hand over data on TikTok's 150 million U.S. users, such as their approximate location or browsing history -- or that Beijing could exploit TikTok to spread misinformation. That helped to explain the adversarial tone of Thursday's hearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
But Bowman says he has not seen any evidence that China is exerting undue influence over TikTok, and he opposes shutting down a popular app without better reasons. (TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, denied at the hearing that ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese government. He also said that TikTok was not a national security risk.)
I also think Bowman just really likes TikTok. He started using it in 2021, has 159,000 followers and says it is a great way to communicate with young constituents and activists. Some of his videos are actually pretty funny.
He's a progressive Democrat. Where are other left-leaning lawmakers on TikTok, like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?
So far, only a couple of other lawmakers have been willing to join Bowman in defense of the platform, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Robert Garcia of California. Both are progressive Democrats like him. Some of Bowman's most outspoken allies, like Ocasio-Cortez, have been mum on this whole dispute so far.
Bowman joined the squad, the group of left-leaning young lawmakers made famous by Ocasio-Cortez, after he won his seat in 2020. Since then, he has consistently tried to push his party leftward on climate and economic issues.
Representative Bowman says the TikTok controversy has been warped by Washington groupthink. What does he mean by that, and what does he think Congress should do about TikTok?
Bowman's view is that Washington is in the middle of a new Red Scare. As China tries to assert a greater role on the world stage, he thinks Republicans and even his own party are rushing to conclusions on many issues, including TikTok.
He said he would rather see Congress slow down and spend its time coming up with a single framework to more tightly regulate how all social media companies -- including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter -- collect and use data.
You write that TikTok has a large lobbying operation led by former congressional aides. What are Representative Bowman's connections to TikTok?
Bowman told me that he does not accept corporate donations or meet with lobbyists. But his office has unquestionably been coordinating with TikTok to make the case against a ban. The company, for example, helped arrange for him to meet with dozens of influencers they had paid to come to Capitol Hill to tout the platform's benefits and then later asked Bowman to host a news conference with them just outside the Capitol. He did so gladly.
Expect a chance of showers, persisting through the evening, with temperatures in the low 50s. At night, temps will drop to the low 40s.
In effect until April 6 (Passover).
The latest New York news
Trump investigations
Hearing resumes Monday: It now appears that any indictment of former President Donald Trump will not come until next week at the earliest. The panel that has been investigating the case does not convene on Fridays.
Bragg pushes back: The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, pushed back in response to a letter from three House Republican committee chairmen. Bragg's general counsel called their demand for communications, documents and testimony from the Trump investigation an inappropriate attempt by Congress to impede a local case.
Rape allegation case: Jurors hearing a trial next month involving a rape allegation by the writer E. Jean Carroll will be kept anonymous because of concern they could become victims of "harassment or worse" by Trump's supporters.
More local news
Speeding up New York roads: A new state bill, if passed and approved, would raise the speed limit on some of the New York's major highways to 70 miles per hour, an increase that would bring the state in line with many other states.
Amazon union: Federal labor regulators have concluded that Amazon's policy of restricting the warehouse access of off-duty employees is illegal, backing a contention of the union that has represented workers at a Staten Island warehouse since winning an election there last year.
Real estate agency faces lawsuit: A real estate agent, who is white, is suing his former employer in part because he says he was fired for speaking up about the treatment of a colleague who is Black at Bespoke Real Estate in the Hamptons.
What we're watching: Maggie Haberman, senior political correspondent for The New York Times, will discuss Donald Trump, and Kashmir Hill, a tech reporter, will explore facial recognition in New York City on "The New York Times Close Up With Sam Roberts." The show airs on Friday at 5 p.m., Saturday at 5 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m. [CUNY TV]
Hotels as migrant shelters
The Row NYC hotel advertises itself as "more New York than New York," a place that combines "urban grit with grandeur." But my colleague Karen Zraick writes that it's been at the center of a humanitarian crisis for months.
It is one of about 100 hotels and other facilities that the city has converted into temporary housing for some of the 50,000 migrants who have arrived on buses from the southern border since last spring. Mayor Eric Adams has warned that the effort may ultimately cost as much as $ 4 billion over the next two years and could force cuts in other city services.
But the temporary housing has benefited hotels, which were devastated in the pandemic. Many of the hotel rooms are being paid for through a bulk contract with the Hotel Association of New York City Foundation, which signed a $ 237 million contract that began in September. In October, the city signed a $ 40 million contract to buy out the 1,300-room Row until mid-April, making it the first of several Midtown hotels that solely house migrant families.
Margarita Buenaño, 43, from Ecuador, was among those outside the Row on a recent afternoon. She is living there with her 10-year-old son and has picked up some work as a house cleaner. Like thousands of others, they had trekked through the perilous Darién Gap, the jungle that connects Colombia and Panama, and kept going north until they reached Texas.
"It's going to be worth it," she said. "We're fighting for our dreams."
Worth the walk
Dear Diary:
My mother needed basil for Sunday night dinner. I walked to the corner store, money in hand, Crocs barely on my feet.
It was a sunny day in Brooklyn, and everyone was out. Looking to my left, I saw a woman in a feather hat with a small Pomeranian. Her hat was mundane compared to her actions.
She reached into her purse and pulled out a large cannoli. Instead of putting it in her mouth, she reached down to the dog to give it to him. Then she pulled out one for herself.
I walked an extra 15 blocks to get one too.

Big-Spending N.F.L. Superfan Charged With Robbing a Bank Goes Missing: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Xavier Babudar, known as Chiefsaholic, missed a Monday court hearing on charges that he robbed a bank in Tulsa, Okla. The court and his bail bondsman are looking for him.
Before this year's Super Bowl, the Kansas City football superfan known as Chiefsaholic was a source of fascination in the sports world. How, people wondered, did a man known for wearing a wolf mask to games and placing large bets end up in jail on charges that he robbed a bank in Tulsa, Okla.?
Now Chiefsaholic, known legally as Xaviar Babudar, is at the heart of a much simpler mystery: Where is he?
Babudar, who had been released from jail while awaiting trial, failed to appear at a hearing Monday morning, according to court records. His court-ordered GPS monitor was found in a wooded area near an Academy Sports + Outdoors store in southern Tulsa with the strap cut off.
Michael Lloyd, the bail bondsman who paid Babudar's $ 80,000 bond to secure his release from jail last month, said the unit's tamper alert went off around 8:30 p.m. Saturday. Lloyd went to Babudar's hotel -- though Babudar lives in the Kansas City, Mo., area, he was required to remain in Tulsa County, Okla., as a condition of his release -- but his room was empty.
Babudar's lawyer, Tracy Tiernan, is as confused as anyone. "I don't know anything about it," he said. "I reached out to him and have not had a response."
Babudar, 28, may be Kansas City's best known fan. He wore a wolf mask and outlandish shirt and pants to nearly every game, including the team's Super Bowl victory in Miami Gardens, Fla., in February 2020.
He cultivated an image as a high roller by frequently posting slips from bets worth thousands of dollars on social media, where he had tens of thousands of followers. He also attended the charity gala of Patrick Mahomes, the team's star quarterback, and apparently won a painting.
When fans questioned how he afforded his lifestyle, Babudar responded that he managed multiple warehouses in the Midwest.
But much of what he said did not add up. Colleges he said he attended had no records of him, and Amazon said he worked at one of its warehouses for just nine months, and not as a manager. Police records from four states painted a picture of Babudar as rootless, living in his car with his mother and brother. He was frequently arrested and charged with petty crimes like shoplifting.
In December, his image as a fun-loving football fan was shattered when he was arrested outside Tulsa. Police say he robbed a credit union by sticking what they called a "CO2 pistol" in a teller's face.
Kansas City fans speculated that he robbed the bank while driving to Houston to attend one of the team's away games, and that was how he funded his expensive lifestyle. But so far he has been charged with robbing just the single bank in Oklahoma. He has pleaded not guilty.
Lloyd, the bail bondsman, said he agreed to pay Babudar's bond in part because he too is a Kansas City fan.
"I did want to help him because he is K.C. wolfman," Lloyd said. "I have followed him for years. And yeah I wanted to help him. What is crazy is I still want to help him."
But to help him, Lloyd will first have to find him.
Soon after Babudar was released from jail in February, Tiernan filed a motion for him to travel to Arizona for what the filing said was a family trip. Not going on the trip would "cause considerable financial hardship for the defendant and his family," the filing said.
The motion was filed three days before the Chiefs were to play the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl held in Glendale, Ariz.
A judge did not consider the motion, and Babudar was not spotted in Arizona. His disappearance nearly seven weeks later, and a week after he paid a court-ordered fee for the GPS monitoring, baffled Lloyd.
"Why did he wait until two days before a hearing? Why did he pay his fees for the leg monitoring? He could've done this a long time ago without paying anybody, without paying a lawyer," Lloyd said.
Babudar may have a strong incentive to travel. If the betting slips he posted on social media are to be believed, he won $ 100,000 when Mahomes was named the N.F.L.'s most valuable player and his team won the Super Bowl. The bets were placed in Kansas, and winnings must be collected in person.
If Babudar is found, he will pay a hefty price to regain his freedom. On Monday, Judge Michelle Keely issued a warrant for his arrest and set a new bond, this time for $ 1 million.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: TV and movie writers want more money, but Hollywood companies say the demands ignore economic realities. The deadline to sort out those differences is approaching.
Television and movie writers want raises, saying that Hollywood companies have taken unfair advantage of the shift to streaming to devalue their work and create worsening working conditions.
The companies bristle at the accusation and say that, while they are willing to negotiate a new "mutually beneficial" deal with writers, the demands for an entirely new compensation structure ignore economic realities.
Whether the sides can settle their differences will determine if the entertainment industry can avoid its first writers' strike in 15 years.
Unions representing more than 11,000 television and movie writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood's nine largest studios, including Amazon and Apple, began talks on March 20 for a new three-year contract. The current agreement expires on May 1.
The Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, have the strength to bring Hollywood to a halt if they do not get a deal to their liking. Chris Keyser, a co-chair of the W.G.A. negotiating committee, said in an interview that this moment for writers was "existential."
"The industry is almost always unfair to labor," Mr. Keyser said. "This time it's broken -- it's actually broken."
Here is what you need to know:
Will there be a strike?
No outcome is certain, but little in the posturing so far suggests an easy resolution. Producers have begun to stockpile scripts by asking writers to complete as many ahead of the May 1 deadline as possible.
The negotiations will likely be acrimonious given the seismic changes in the industry. The rapid transition to streaming entertainment has upended nearly every corner of Hollywood, and writers believe they have been left behind.
Unlike directors and actors, writers have historically been willing to strike. The most recent strike stretched from 2007 into 2008, lasting 100 days. One in 1988 dragged on for five months. A walkout must first be authorized by union members; the W.G.A. has signaled that it could conduct a vote as early as the first week in April.
Authorization gives the union leverage, but it does not mean a strike is inevitable. In 2017, writers overwhelmingly gave the go-ahead for a strike (with 96 percent of the vote). The sides ultimately reached an agreement a few hours before the first pickets hit studio sidewalks.
How would a strike affect audiences?
There will be a gradual halt in the production of many television shows, except for reality and news programs, which would be mostly unaffected.
Viewers will notice the fallout first among entertainment talk shows, including "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon." If a strike lasts several weeks, "Saturday Night Live" would not be able complete its season. Soap operas, already on viewership life support, would run out of new episodes after about a month.
Plenty of high-profile TV series have coming seasons that are already finished. But premieres for fall series like "Abbott Elementary" would be delayed by a monthslong strike, and viewers would begin to notice fewer scripted TV series by the end of the year. Reality and international shows will start to run in heavy rotation.
Moviegoers would not experience immediate effects; movie studios work about a year ahead, meaning that almost everything planned for 2023 has already been shot. The risk involves 2024, especially if studios rush to beat a strike by putting films into production with scripts that aren't quite ready.
What are the writers' complaints?
Every three years, the writers' union negotiates a contract with the major studios that establishes pay minimums and addresses matters such as health care and residuals (a type of royalty), which are paid out based on a maze of formulas.
And though there has been a boom in television production in recent years (known within the industry as "Peak TV"), the W.G.A. said that the median weekly pay for a writer-producer had declined 4 percent over the last decade.
Because of streaming, the former network norms of 22, 24 or even 26 episodes per season have mostly disappeared. Many series are now eight to 12 episodes long. At the same time, episodes are taking longer to produce, so series writers who are paid per episode often make less while working more. Some showrunners are likewise making less despite working longer hours.
"The streaming model has created an environment where there's been enormous downward pressure on writer income across the board," David Goodman, a co-chair of the guild negotiating committee, said in an interview.
Screenwriters have been hurt by a decline in theatrical releases and the collapse of the DVD market, union leaders said.
Between 2012 and 2021, the number of films rated annually by the Motion Picture Association fell by 31 percent. Streaming services picked up some slack, but companies like Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO Max, have been cutting back on film production to reduce costs amid slowing subscriber growth.
Are the companies in a position to pay more?
They would argue this isn't the best time for it.
Disney said in February that it would cut $ 5.5 billion in costs and eliminate 7,000 jobs to address streaming losses, an atrophying cable television business and steep corporate debt. Warner Bros. Discovery has already cut thousands of jobs as part of a $ 4 billion retrenchment. NBCUniversal is also tightening its belt as it contends with cable cord-cutting and a troublesome advertising market.
The writers are unmoved by this. Mr. Keyser noted that Netflix is already profitable (to the tune of $ 4.5 billion last year), and that rival companies have said their streaming services will be profitable in the next year or two. "We don't get to negotiate again until 2026," Mr. Keyser said. "We're not waiting around until they're profitable."
Who's doing the negotiating?
In a rarity for Hollywood, the chief negotiators are both women. Carol Lombardini, 68, leads the studio effort; she has worked at the producers' alliance for 41 years. Ellen Stutzman, 40, leads the W.G.A. effort. She was appointed only about a month ago, after David Young, who has served as the ferocious negotiator for writers since 2007, stepped aside, citing an unspecified medical problem.
Ms. Stutzman, who has been with the W.G.A. for 17 years, said in an interview that Mr. Young would play no part in these negotiations. She called him "a wonderful mentor."
Are the studios aligned?
Absolutely, according to the producers' alliance. "The A.M.P.T.P. companies approach this negotiation and the ones to follow with the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority," the alliance said in a statement, referring to impending contract renewal talks with directors and actors. "We are all partners in charting the future of our business together and fully committed to reaching a mutually beneficial deal."
But differences start to appear when you talk to senior executives on a company-by-company basis. In private conversations, they point out that the group is much less monolithic than in the past. It now includes tech companies like Amazon and Apple, for example, whose primary business is not entertainment.
Is the W.G.A. united?
For generations, ever since the end of the silent film era, Hollywood writers have complained that studios treat them as second-class citizens -- that their artistic contributions are underappreciated (and undercompensated), especially compared with those of actors and directors. This sentiment runs deep among writers and has historically resulted in extraordinary unity.
In 2019, when film and TV writers fired their agents in a campaign over what they saw as conflicts of interest, many agency leaders figured that the W.G.A. would eventually fracture. That never happened: After a 22-month standoff, the big agencies effectively gave writers what they wanted.
What about collateral damage?
Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled during the 2007 strike, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $ 2 billion, according to the Milken Institute. This time around, many of the small businesses that service Hollywood (florists, caterers, chauffeurs, stylists, lumber yard workers) have only started to regain their footing after pandemic shutdowns, increasing the stakes of a strike and potentially leading to community fissures.

Full text: When two artists bought the vacant building, it was 'grim and creepy.' Now it's not only a home -- it's a communal arts space.
A few years after Demi Raven and Janet Galore were introduced by a mutual friend and fell in love, they started looking for a home where they could live together. But for artists with careers in technology, it was clear that a cookie-cutter house would not suffice.
"We spent some time thinking about what kind of future space we'd like to live in," said Mr. Raven, 52, a software engineer at Amazon. "And we were aligned pretty closely in that we wanted something atypical and creative."
"It's that dream a lot of artists have," added Ms. Galore, 58, a user-experience design manager at Google. "You want to find a raw space, and something you can build into a live-work space where you can make art."
Fortunately, the friend who introduced them, Marlow Harris, is not just a matchmaker, but also a real estate broker. And she knew of an unusual building for sale that she was sure the couple would like: a former corner grocery store from 1929 in the North Beacon Hill neighborhood of Seattle.
The building, which had a retail space on the ground floor and a three-bedroom apartment above with a separate entrance, had most recently been used as an outreach ministry for a church. But by the time Mr. Raven and Ms. Galore saw it in 2015, the ground floor had been empty for years and the upstairs was barely habitable.
Outside, the building's red bricks were beginning to fall out, as the mortar turned to dust. Inside, there were beaten-up walk-in coolers and leftover commercial sinks.
"It was a little bit grim and creepy, to be honest," Mr. Raven said.
The decrepit interior was so creepy, in fact, that it inspired the couple's first art project in the space. "We made a horror movie about it," Ms. Galore said.
But despite the off-putting elements, the building got their creative juices flowing. "It was very much the size and shape of what I had hoped to find," Ms. Galore said. "When you walk in the main door of what was the grocery store, you come into this big, 1,200-square-foot room with 13-and-a-half-foot ceilings and big windows."
The building -- a total of 3,680 square feet -- was more than the couple, who married in July 2016, needed for their home and studio. It was big enough, they realized, to serve as a community arts space with exhibitions and performances by other artists.
"With a little courage and vision, you could see that the space was going to be really beautiful if someone gave it love and attention," Mr. Raven said.
In the beginning, that someone was Mr. Raven. After the couple closed on the property in October 2015 for $ 700,000, they slept on a pullout sofa in the old grocery store while Mr. Raven renovated the upstairs apartment. But right from the beginning, the couple began hosting exhibitions, performances and concerts, calling their new space The Grocery Studios.
When the apartment was ready in January 2017, the couple moved upstairs. Then they turned their attention to the ground floor, which they wanted to convert from a commercial to a residential space and connect with a new interior staircase. They knew they needed professional help to make such big changes, so they hired Mutuus Studio, an architecture firm, and Robb Joyce, the general contractor who owned A.R. Joyce Remodel and lived across the street.
"They were using the downstairs as a studio," said Jim Friesz, a partner at Mutuus Studio. "But the heating was marginal, the concrete floors were at all different levels, the windows had been replaced with plexiglass, and the first and second floors weren't connected. It just needed work."
The architects found an ideal place for the new staircase, installed columns and beams as part of a seismic retrofit, replaced the plexiglass with glass windows covered by frosted privacy film, added insulation, tightened up the building envelope and poured a level concrete floor.
Just off the open living room, which doubles as the main gallery space, they added a kitchen with a steel-clad peninsula. They made custom cabinet fronts by covering plywood panels with linen and resin, and created counters with Fenix laminate on top of plywood with exposed edges.
And wherever they could, the architects tried to maintain the building's original character. During demolition, they discovered that the walls and ceiling of a former garage were lined in solid Douglas fir as a fire-safety measure, and they left it exposed in the new guest bedroom. In one of the bathrooms, they mixed pristine white subway tile with existing painted brick and steel.
After construction began in the summer of 2018, it took three years of start-and-stop effort to make the changes, because of budget concerns and pandemic-related delays. But the job was substantially complete in July 2021, although Mr. Raven is still making finishing touches, including building more storage closets. By doing so much work themselves, the couple kept the total renovation cost down to about $ 700,000.
Once the two floors of the building were combined into a single-family home, Mr. Raven and Ms. Galore began holding art events again. They also established Walk Up Gallery, or WUG -- a tiny, street-facing gallery space in the former store's two front windows.
To make it easy to transform their living room into an event space, the couple have furnished it with lightweight pieces that can be quickly moved and stored, including upholstered benches and sprightly wood coffee tables. "We hang out, watch TV and live down here," Ms. Galore said. "But within half an hour, we can pull everything out of the room and transform it into something else."
So far, the space has seen about 40 performances, exhibitions and other events -- which has left Mr. Raven and Ms. Galore eager for more.
"There's a certain energy that comes from doing these shows," Mr. Raven said. "The amount of gratitude we see from people, both artists and guests, every time we do it, just leaves us wanting to do it again. It's self-perpetuating."

'Sorcery' in Mexico City: A Japanese Green Thumb's Purple Legacy: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Every spring, jacarandas bloom in Mexico City. The colorful purple flowers are a living legacy of a Japanese gardener.
The Mexican president wanted cherry trees.
It was 1930, and President Pascual Ortiz Rubio had seen them lining the streets of Washington and desired the same beautiful spectacle for his country's capital.
To try to fulfill the leader's request, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs tapped Tatsugoro Matsumoto, a Japanese immigrant who tended the gardens of Chapultepec, then the presidential residence in Mexico City. But winters in the capital were not cold enough for the cherries to fully blossom, the expert gardener said. The president wouldn't get his hanami, the flower-contemplation ritual the Japanese celebrate every spring.
At least not a pink one.
If cherries were not suitable for the Mexican capital, another tree with colorful flowers might do the trick: jacarandas.
Mr. Matsumoto had already advised another president to plant jacarandas in the city. But those were the post-revolutionary years when there were few government resources to spend on beautifying Mexico's capital, according to Sergio Hernández, a researcher at the National Institute of Anthropology and History.
History has blurred some details of the president's request and its execution, but today the jacarandas stand tall among the city's greenery, a lush canopy heralding spring's arrival.
For nearly 100 years, Mexico City residents have enjoyed jacaranda season: a "fascinating sorcery" that brings a little bit of the Amazon rainforest to urbanites' doorstep, as Alberto Ruy Sánchez wrote in his 2019 book "Dicen las Jacarandas." And when the flowers fall, "the sky blooms on the ground," an unexpected burst of color at one's feet.
Each spring, millions of people stroll around the country's capital under an explosion of purple flowers. Each spring, the colorful fronds signal that it's time to enjoy the warm season and walk on a fine rug of lavender petals. Come out and play, the jacarandas whisper with an inflection that's both foreign and familiar.
"I was told this tree always creates hope," said Alma Basilio, a psychologist posing for a selfie with a friend under the blossoms "The jacaranda is kindness."
Jacarandas are actually not native to Mexico: The name comes from Guaraní, an Indigenous language spoken mainly in Paraguay and the tree has its origin in the Amazon.
They are deciduous trees, meaning they lose their foliage every year when the weather turns cold enough. And when temperatures rise, their bare, tortuous branches fill with bunches of blooms.
"Boom! Immediately, not progressively, the whole tree is full of flowers," said José Luis López Robledo, an arborist who runs a nursery garden near Mexico City.
The flowers grow in bunches and bear an attractive purple-blue color because of anthocyanins, a pigment also found in dahlias, berries, black beans and sweet potatoes. In 2021, when most of the planet was focused on pandemic survival, jacaranda was named a trend color by a Mexican forecast company.
"The color jacaranda is an omen for a rebirth," the agency, Trendo.mx said, describing the hue as between amethyst and mauve, comparable to periwinkle.
The man responsible for the purple spring, Mr. Matsumoto, was one of the first Japanese immigrants to come to Latin America as a free man, at a time when most Asian immigrants in Latin America came either as indentured servants or with contracts to supply cheap labor to plantations, mines and railroads.
Mr. Matsumoto's Mexican immigration card says he arrived in 1896, and listed "gardener" as his occupation. But in Japan, he was in fact a trained landscape architect who had served the imperial palace, Mr. Hernández explained.
Mr. Matsumoto made his way to the Americas in 1888 at the behest of a Peruvian entrepreneur who wanted a Japanese garden, the first in South America, on his property.
"From his faraway native land, the artist brought by ship beautiful plants," reads a Peruvian volume about the residence where the garden was built. Shortly after seeing his work in Lima, a Mexican mining businessman hired him to create something for his hacienda.
Mr. Matsumoto would eventually become a wealthy entrepreneur who served several Mexican presidents: from the French-loving Porfirio Díaz to the revolutionary Álvaro Obregón and the nationalist Lázaro Cárdenas. With his flower shop, which he opened in 1898, Mr. Matsumoto introduced ornate floral arrangements to high society and created bouquets for stars of the golden era of Mexican film.
In recent years, Mr. Matsumoto's talents with flora have made him something of a local pop icon, a quiet hero. But Mr. Hernández, who has documented extensively Mr. Matsumoto's trajectory, points out he was much more than that.
He didn't introduce the jacarandas to Mexico -- some may have already been growing in the wild -- as much as domesticate them. He didn't just suggest a more appropriate tree for the weather in the Mexican capital: He outfitted its streets with an aesthetic vision that resurfaces every spring.
"Matsumoto was a merchant of landscapes," said Mr. Hernández.
In a city of old trees and crooked sidewalks, jacarandas are good tenants: Their roots tend to grow downward -- instead of to the sides -- and leave the urban infrastructure almost untouched. But because they grow tall (they can reach up to 80 feet), they can be a nemesis of electric wires and a target of the tree trimmers of the utility company.
In recent years, jacarandas have also drawn detractors: "Controversy Blooms Over Jacarandas," read an article this month that quoted specialists warning exotic species might create imbalance in the local ecosystems.
"They're too hyped," said Francisco Arjona, 34, an environmental engineer who leads tours of trees around Mexico City. He can list parks, intersections and parking spaces where one can admire the spectacle, but he also reminds visitors that they are also home to many other beautiful native trees.
By the 1940s, as the first generation of jacarandas were perhaps a bit over 30 feet high, Mr. Matsumoto and his son, Sanshiro, had become advocates for their community. When Mexico ordered all Japanese in the country to relocate to Mexico City and Guadalajara because of World War II, the Matsumotos interceded with the government and lodged 900 of their displaced compatriots in one of their many sprawling haciendas.
Jesús Roldán, 38, a mountain climber, was sitting below the crooked branches of a blooming jacaranda outside the Palace of Fine Arts, one of the most tagged trees on Instagram.
"They seem really complex to me, from their stature to their color, its arms and structure are very difficult to understand," he said. "I think they're not comfortable, perhaps they'd be better elsewhere."
Matsumoto Flowershop, on the northern edge of a trendy street in the Roma Norte neighborhood sits now mostly vacant, its expansive front outfitted with a handful of withering plastic flowers, an old sign and a lonely desk. Mexico City's urban landscape is continually changing: new buildings rise every day, hundreds of palm trees are dying to an unforgiving plague, water-conscious gardeners look for plants that will last through a drought. Winters are becoming shorter and hotter.
However, "if something will survive, it'll be the jacarandas," said Mr. López Robledo.

CFBR
/see-ef-bee-ahr/
An abbreviation for "commenting for better reach," so social media posts can be boosted by algorithms that favor content with high engagement.
Abbreviations like "LOL" and "ILY" are popular expressions used across the web, and these days chances are you have probably seen "CFBR," which stands for "commenting for better reach" and appears regularly under posts on LinkedIn.
People comment "CFBR" on others' posts to signal solidarity, and sometimes people ask commenters to write "CFBR" on their own posts to give them traction. The expression is becoming ubiquitous on LinkedIn as tech workers who have lost their jobs in recent months are turning to the platform to look for new opportunities.
A short comment from a stranger could mean hundreds more people see a post about layoffs, and come across a jobseeker's profile.
Last year, more than 161,000 people were laid off from technology companies and start-ups, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts. So far this year, more than 148,000 people have been laid off.
Over the past six months, as the tech sector has had its worst contraction since the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, the number of people who have turned on the "open to work" feature on LinkedIn has increased 20 percent, to 18 million, a spokeswoman for the company said.
Stephan Meier, a professor at Columbia Business School, called commenting on a layoff post "a completely altruistic act," especially if the commenter doesn't know the poster. The activity around layoffs shows how much people rely on LinkedIn -- and its algorithm -- to network, he said.
Late last year, when Amazon began to lay off what would become 18,000 employees, Heather Harris, 34, posted on LinkedIn about the cuts, asking people to "like, share, comment for better reach" on her posts.
Since then, strangers have tagged Ms. Harris, who works in human resources, in posts about job openings and sent her encouraging messages.
"I don't know if the 'CFBR' did it, but I kind of feel like it did," she said. "The more that people comment on your posts, the more it pops up on other people's feeds."
But Ms. Harris doesn't comment "CFBR" on other people's posts. She prefers the solidarity underpinning "CFBR" over the term itself. It can seem "spammy," she said, akin to "like for like" comments on Instagram.
"My personal preference is to comment something that is sincere and genuine and encouraging, rather than just 'CFBR,"' she said.
Ankit Singh, 30, writes "CFBR" only on posts about layoffs because he believes those posts need to be more visible on LinkedIn than other posts. He has noticed people commenting "reach+" -- with varying amounts of pluses -- on layoff posts, and said those comments also represented professionals looking out for one another.
"As a job seeker, I know how people feel," said Mr. Singh, who studies electrical engineering at New York University. "Even if I just click like or comment 'CFBR,' it's something to help them. If someone comments on my post, and a recruiter sees it, it could help me."

Questlove Now Has A Publishing Imprint To Call His Very Own: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The musician and producer Ahmir Thompson, better known as Questlove, is starting his own imprint, with eye toward a mix of memoir, history and more.
On top of being a D.J., producer, filmmaker, drummer, Academy Award-winning director, culinary entrepreneur, member of the hip-hop band the Roots and scholar of Black musical history, Ahmir Thompson, also known as Questlove, is a prolific author. He's written and co-authored seven books, including best sellers like "Mo' Meta Blues," "Creative Quest" and "Music is History," and a forthcoming children's book about time travel.
Now Thompson is adding a prestigious new title to his wide-ranging list of creative endeavors: publisher.
This year, Thompson is starting his own book imprint within MCD Books, a publishing division at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, where he will acquire an eclectic mix of fiction and nonfiction that ranges from memoir and books by social media stars to works about music history and business.
Thompson described the imprint, which he named AUWA Books, as akin to starting a music label.
"I would like to think of myself of what Def Jam was trying to be back in 1985 -- keep my ear to the streets, keep it underground and keep my eyes on people that you otherwise would have never have heard of, but who I feel can really do a paradigm shift," he said.
He came up with the idea of starting an imprint a few years ago, when he was beginning work on "Summer of Soul," a documentary he directed about an epic 1969 cultural festival and concert in Harlem. He was unsettled by the fact that the concert marked a pivotal moment in American cultural history, but had largely been forgotten. "With the rapid influx of death happening with Black creators and no one to pass the recipes down I wanted to bring action to a dire situation," he said.
Publishing books seemed like a way to keep a record and give overlooked cultural figures and movements their due.
"I'm in a phase of my life where I'm trying to rebuild the world I never had myself as a kid," he said. "Through this imprint, I'm offering a platform."
MCD, a literary imprint that runs toward the experimental, seemed like a natural home. Thompson had been a fan and supporter of some of the imprint's books, especially Dan Charnas's "Dilla Time," about the hip-hop producer J Dilla.
Sean McDonald, the publisher of MCD Books, described Thompson's editorial sensibility as "a little disruptive and trying to do something new."
"That polymath quality is one of the things that's amazing about him," McDonald said. "It feels like it's helping us expand our scope."
Thompson has already acquired a handful of titles. In October, the imprint will release a memoir from the songwriter and producer Sly Stone, titled, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," about his unlikely rise to fame and his precipitous fall. Written with Ben Greenman, the book will feature a foreword by Thompson, who is also working on a documentary about Stone.
He's also lined up several books about business, online activism and grass roots organizing, including "Building the Hype Economy," about the business and culture of collecting by the entrepreneur and sneaker collector Josh Luber; an inspirational book by the TikTok and podcasting personality Drew Afualo, who's developed a huge online following for campaigns against bigotry and misogyny; and "Handbook for the Revolution: The Essential Guide to Workplace Organizing," by Derrick Palmer, the vice president and co-founder of Amazon's labor union, who made headlines for his work as a labor activist who took on the world's largest retailer.
In 2024, Thompson will release his own book, "Hip Hop Is History," also co-written with Greenman. The book is a sequel of sorts to "Music Is History," which looked at popular American music from recent decades and how it shaped culture and history and Thompson's worldview.
Coming up with a name for the imprint was the hardest part, Thompson said. He wanted the name to nod to Prince, an artist he reveres. The solution hit him when he was listening to a Prince song while driving, and heard Prince make a wild birdcall sound: ah-oh-wah. He decided to name the imprint AUWA Books.
"When I heard this bird call, I was like, that's it," he said. "That's my tribute to him."

Maybe It's Not So Bad When the Internet Is Down: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Who's really in charge of our online behavior? No one, David Auerbach argues in "Meganets."
"Just one word. Are you listening?" Mr. Maguire said to Benjamin Braddock in "The Graduate" (1967). "Plastics."
Twenty-five years later a puckish French horn player warned me, a literature major who didn't yet have an email address, that the future lay in something called "hyperlinks."
Now here comes David B. Auerbach with a new piece of argot, and a book, for our fast-changing times: "Meganets." It's a muscular-sounding term that a few companies, including a communications provider and sprinkler system, have already claimed. (I found this out, naturally, on Google, which along with Microsoft once employed Auerbach as a software engineer.) But his definition of "meganet" is in essence a big blob of mortal and computing power, a "human-machine behemoth" controlled by no one. If the internet is the fictional doctor and scientist Bruce Banner, furtive and a little troubled but basically benign, meganets are Incredible Hulks, snarling and uncontainable.
About the competing concept of the metaverse, the vision of an imminent, investable digital world that has been on everyone but especially Mark Zuckerberg's lips, Auerbach is a little hand-wavy, calling it "terribly vague." And moreover nothing so new. "Don't we already socialize, play and work in an all-too-immersive online world?" he writes. "That world may not be 'The Matrix,' but all the connecting tissue is already there."
Along with all the literature about "unplugging" or learning "How to Do Nothing," as Jenny Odell titled her flower-festooned 2019 best seller, "Meganets" made me feel deeply queasy about the amount of time I spend on Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and Twitter. Not Facebook, never Facebook -- "a fount of misinformation," as Auerbach calls it, "a petri dish in which false facts and crazy theories grow, mutate and metastasize" -- except for the burner account I use occasionally to see what exes are up to.
When my tiny, "private" Instagram account was hacked last year by an enterprising bitcoin entrepreneur in a faraway land, I went into full-blown panic -- especially after a nameless entity at Insta requested and then rejected a series of slow-mo video selfies, tilting head to the ceiling even, to verify my account.
Was this the experience of a validation addict going through withdrawal? No, let's reframe: I was trapped in a meganet (especially now that Facebook's parent company, Meta, owns Insta): a middle-aged mermaid thrashing about in the great online ocean as data floated around me, multiplying like plankton.
A Gen Xer might well feel at sea too in Auerbach's extensive chapter about cryptocurrency. "Reality bites," we naïvely thought, but here "reality forks," with blockchain doubling back on itself like a caterpillar. "No Rousseau-esque 'General Will' emerges from the bugs and forks," is the takeaway.
Auerbach is as at home with literature and philosophy as in the engine room, quoting Kenneth Burke, George Trow and Shakespeare (in a discussion of artificial intelligence's inability to determine the authorship of the Elizabethan play "Arden of Faversham"). "I have waited more than five years for Amazon to notify me of an available copy of Grigol Robakidze's novel 'The Snake's Skin,"' he writes, "supposedly published in 2015" -- this would be a reissue of a 1928 Georgian modernist classic that does sound fascinating -- "but I will never get that notification because the book's Amazon page is in reality a tombstone for a book that never existed."
According to his previous, memoirish book, "Bitwise," Auerbach first gave America the ability to type smiley faces in chat. If I were responding to "Meganets" that way, it would be with ð, which can obscure an intermittent lack of comprehension. This is a deeply interesting book, but for the average "user," which is what the meganets have made of readers and writers, a sometimes hard to access one. It was fascinating to be reminded of the failed experiment of Google+ (remember?), the search index's answer to Facebook, and more about Aadhaar, India's national identification program: "a unified, government-sanctioned meganet," Auerbach writes. A "Data Abundance" chart that shows how many messages are sent and photos shared on various platforms each minute renders life's new entwinement with unsettling precision.
But trying to follow along as Auerbach described a virtual pandemic called Corrupted Blood that spread through the video game World of Warcraft in 2005, arguing that "the distance between Corrupted Blood and a global financial meltdown is smaller than you think," this "user" felt trapped in a dark rec room with a hoodie pulled over my face. It was like attempting to solve CAPTCHAs with different kinds of obscure motor vehicles. (Why never flowers?)
"Cloud" is a term Auerbach finds as nebulous as the "metaverse," and yet his own text is pretty densely fogged -- though worth the trip for the occasional breaks through to see the horizon; the lightning bolts of his own philosophical insight.
"We search for where the power really lies, when it does not lie anywhere -- or else it lies everywhere at once, which is no more helpful."
"If you do not give people what they want, what do you give them?" ("What they never knew they wanted," Diana Vreeland would retort.)
And, in a Biblical-sounding proposal to mitigate this Orwellian hell: "If Big Brother can't be stopped, we should focus on throwing sand in his eyes rather than futilely trying to kill him."
Take my Wi-Fi -- please!

For TV News, Prime Time Comes Early: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The biggest draw on Fox News is no longer Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it's "The Five." And daytime shows on CNN and MSNBC are outranking evening programming.
There's a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it's "The Five," the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama "Yellowstone," was last year's most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber's 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC -- the first time in the network's 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors' careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that's changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Mr. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus -- or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night -- America's news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Ms. Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
"The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now," said Mosheh Oinounou, a former "CBS Evening News" executive producer. "It's no different from traditional TV -- the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show."
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans over 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans over 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 -- the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
"Unless there's something supercompelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch," said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. "There's so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch 'Top Gun: Maverick' on streaming. It's hard for the news to compete with Maverick."
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few longstanding assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don't necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were -- and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day's news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like the former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network's new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing "fresh and unique perspectives to the news," but it's also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN's 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network's highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Mr. Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot by temporarily moving Mr. Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks, and dismal ratings, Mr. Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, "The Lead," now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN's evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program "The Rachel Maddow Show" was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC's prime-time viewership above that of Fox News -- the cable news ratings king -- in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Ms. Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, the political analyst Alex Wagner, has beaten CNN in total viewership, but her 2023 ratings are tracking about 30 percent lower than what Ms. Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Mr. Melber and Mr. Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC's prime-time audience declined 21 percent from a year prior, and CNN lost 33 percent.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2 percent from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, "The Five," is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, "The Five" leaped past Mr. Carlson last year to achieve Fox News's biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Mr. Carlson still outranks "The Five" among adults under 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show's success. "People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is 'The Five,"' Lachlan Murdoch, chief executive of the Fox Corporation, said at an investor conference last week. "It's a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics."
"The Five" has also incubated two of the network's rising stars. Fox News turned to Mr. Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its strait-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
"The Five" isn't the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Mr. Watters's 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Mr. Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier's "Special Report," at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ms. Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that, for generations, summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC's "World News Tonight," anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Mr. Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
"This is what we've been seeing for years," Mr. Oinounou said, laughing. "People look for a digest of news as they're about to eat dinner, and then we'll send you to more traditional entertainment -- written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington."

CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot temporarily by moving Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks and dismal ratings, Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, political analyst Alex Wagner, has beaten CNN in total viewership, but her 2023 ratings are tracking about 30% lower than what Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Melber and Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21% from a year prior, and CNN lost 33%.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2% from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’ biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults younger than 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of the Fox Corp., said at an investor conference on March 9. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its strait-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Watters’ 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that for generations summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.”

Full text: What's Up? (March 12-18)
Financial Panic
After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in last weekend to take over Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, panic rippled through the banking sector, touching off government interventions to prop up other suffering banking institutions. On Thursday, 11 of the country's biggest banks combined resources to inject $ 30 billion into First Republic Bank, the 14th-largest U.S. bank, which found itself on the brink of collapse. The infusion was the result of an agreement reached by Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, whose bank saved several rivals during the 2008 financial crisis. But though some hear echoes of 2008 in this banking crisis, the White House would like to avoid comparisons. Despite sweeping actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury and F.D.I.C. to protect clients' deposits and assets and shore up confidence in the country's banks, President Biden is loath to use the term "bailout."
More Tech Layoffs
Meta announced last week that it would lay off another 10,000 employees, or 13 percent of its work force, as it pares down after a hiring boom that accelerated during the pandemic. The mass layoff is the second to roil Meta in recent months: In November, the company let go 11,000 workers across departments and regions. In the time since, Meta reported that it was taking a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge for the fourth quarter and expecting an additional $ 1 billion in restructuring costs in 2023 to account for its plans to terminate some office space leases, redesign some data center projects and pay out severance for laid-off employees. Similar efforts to cut costs have been underway at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce, as boom times in the tech industry come to an end.
Inflation Remains Stubborn
Data released on Tuesday showed that annual inflation had cooled slightly, with the Consumer Price Index climbing 6 percent over the year through February -- down from 6.4 percent in January. But more troubling signs lay beneath the surface of the report: Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, climbed 0.5 percent from the previous month, exceeding analysts' expectations and making for the fastest monthly pickup since September. Officials at the Federal Reserve had been awaiting this data to inform their decision about interest-rate increases at their next meeting this week.
What's Next? (March 19-25)
A Juggernaut in the Spotlight
Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, will testify again before Congress on Thursday as the app comes under increasing scrutiny from President Biden and other policymakers in Washington. Last week, TikTok said the Biden administration wanted its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app, threatening a ban in the United States if it could not complete a deal. The crux of Washington lawmakers' concerns is fear that Beijing could request the data of the 100 million Americans who use the app. But a sale could be difficult to pull off: TikTok's price tag of $ 50 billion or more would be too steep for all except a tech giant like Meta or Google -- but those companies would probably want to avoid the antitrust battle that could arise from trying to acquire the social media juggernaut.
What Will the Fed Do?
As the Federal Reserve prepares to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, central bankers face a more complicated calculus than they may have expected a few weeks ago. There are new economic data, including job and inflation reports, to factor into their decision on how much to raise interest rates -- or whether to raise them at all. But officials are also looking at the collapse of three banks that were caught flat-footed by the previous jump in rates, which significantly dinged the market value of their holdings. So while a relatively hot job market and persistent inflation provide Fed officials with reason to continue on a path of aggressive rate increases, the turmoil in the banking sector has made analysts uncertain about the Fed's next move.
Dominion v. Fox, Continued
On Tuesday, lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News will present their oral arguments for summary judgment in Dominion's suit accusing Fox of defaming it by casting the company as a villain as the network amplified false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Dominion requested the summary judgment, which is a process for deciding a case without going to trial. The company has argued that Fox has not provided any new evidence to support its election conspiracies and that the news network has already conceded that it knew the on-air statements were bogus. Its court filing includes many of the recently released private messages that Fox News anchors and other staff exchanged, expressing skepticism about the narrative the network was promoting on its broadcasts.
What Else?
Emmett Shear, the chief executive of the livestreaming site Twitch, said on Thursday that he was resigning after 16 years. A federal regulator last week approved a $ 31 billion rail company merger, paving the way for the creation a railroad that links Canada, the United States and Mexico. And CNN's prime-time audience has fallen since the network overhauled its 9 p.m. programming.

Lance Reddick, Star of 'The Wire' and 'John Wick,' Is Dead at 60: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A prolific actor, he also starred in the Amazon series "Bosch" and had recently branched out into video games like Horizon Zero Dawn and the Destiny franchise.
Lance Reddick, a prolific actor who gained fame playing a police commander on the Baltimore crime drama "The Wire" and later had prominent roles in the "John Wick" movie franchise and the Amazon series "Bosch," died on Friday. He was 60.
His death was confirmed by his publicist, Mia Hansen. She did not say where he died or cite a cause.
Mr. Reddick was having some success as a stage actor when, in 1996, he began landing small roles on "New York Undercover," "The West Wing" and other television series, as well as some TV movies.
Even then he was often playing law enforcement figures, and he would be doing so when his breakthrough came in 2002: He was cast as Lt. Cedric Daniels, the principled head of the investigation unit, on "The Wire," the sprawling HBO series that was praised for its realistic and often downbeat depiction of policing, crime, education and other aspects of life in Baltimore.
The series ran for five seasons and is widely regarded as having brought a new level of sophistication to police dramas and television in general.
"Ever since 'The Wire,"' Mr. Reddick told "The IMDB Show" in a video interview, "I've played a lot of intimidating authority figures that talk a lot."
On the Fox science fiction drama "Fringe," which made its debut in 2008, he was Phillip Broyles, a Homeland Security agent. In the crime drama "Bosch," which ran from 2014 to 2021, he was a police official. In the movie "White House Down" (2013), about an assault on the White House, he was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"Intensity is not something I try to do," he told The Queensland Times of Australia in 2010. "It's just kind of the way that I am."
He got away from law-enforcement roles in the "John Wick" movies, the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves in the title role. He played Charon, a hotel manager, in all four films, the first of which was released in 2014. The latest is being released this month.
In all those roles, and in others, Mr. Reddick was a distinctive, instantly recognizable presence, even if he was not quite a household name. His voice was distinctive, too, as players of Horizon Zero Dawn, Destiny 2 and other video games on which he could be heard know.
"Range is always what I'm striving for," Mr. Reddick told The Los Angeles Times in 2019. "I never want anybody to say, 'Oh, this is who he is.' Although the characters I play, even in all their diversity, tend to be fairly intense. But they're all very different guys."
Beginning in 2008 he was in a few episodes of the ABC series "Lost," playing a character named Matthew Abaddon. The show had a wide following, and though the character wasn't around long, Mr. Reddick said it boosted his visibility even more than "The Wire" had.
"I was living in New York at the time, and it seemed like everybody was stopping me to talk about 'Lost,"' he told The Baltimore Sun in 2019. "I went from small, niche notoriety to being completely recognizable."
Lance Solomon Reddick was born on June 7, 1962, in Baltimore. His mother taught instrumental music, and his father was an educator and later a public defender.
Mr. Reddick attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., where he studied classical composition. He was a skilled pianist and in 2010 released an album of his own works, "Contemplations & Remembrances."
By the early 1990s Mr. Reddick was in Boston and exploring acting. He soon enrolled at the Yale School of Drama, where he received a master's degree. He performed at Yale Repertory Theater with Liev Schreiber and other future stars.
"When I went to drama school," he told The Los Angeles Times in 2009, "I knew I was at least as talented as other students, but because I was a Black man and I wasn't pretty, I knew I would have to work my butt off to be the best that I would be, and to be noticed."
In 1995, at Manhattan Theater Club in New York, he appeared in "After-Play," Anne Meara's play about two couples who settle in for dinner after attending the theater; Mr. Reddick portrayed their mysterious waiter. The play had a long run in New York, and in 1997 he reprised the role at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut.
By then his television work was beginning to pick up, although he did not abandon the stage completely. In 2006 he was in Signature Theater Company's New York revival of August Wilson's "Seven Guitars," putting his musical background to good use portraying a blues musician named Floyd.
"Floyd's charisma and his anger are all the more impressive for the quietness with which Mr. Reddick renders them," Ben Brantley wrote in his review in The New York Times.
To prepare for his role in "The Wire," Mr. Reddick told the Australian newspaper, he did a few ride-alongs with police officers in the South Bronx.
"They were saying, 'This section is OK, that section is bad," he said. "What we were seeing was block and block and block of abandoned houses and drug addicts wandering around. It was almost surreal."
Mr. Reddick was working on several projects at his death, including a new version of "The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial."
He is survived by his wife, Stephanie Reddick; a daughter, Yvonne Nicole Reddick; and a son, Christopher Reddick.
In a 2010 interview with The Miami Herald, Mr. Reddick said the role that particularly stood out for him was one of his smaller ones: a guest appearance on "Law & Order."
"I played an army captain from Sierra Leone in 2001 before I was cast in 'The Wire,"' he said, "and I had to learn the Sierra Leone accent. To this day, that's my favorite character, the character I'm most proud of."

Full text: Our TV critic recommends an Australian apocalyptic comedy, an expansive climate-crisis drama and a new dance competition series.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and 'Yellowjackets' is too scary for me.
'Class of '07'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
Zoe (Emily Browning) was going to skip her 10-year reunion at her Australian all-girls boarding school completely, still licking her wounds from a disastrous exit from a "Bachelor"-like show. But when a freak flood sends her scrambling for higher elevation, she winds up crashing the party -- and that flood turns out to be the apocalypse, or as she and her former classmates start calling it, "the poco."
"Class" has the "old friends keep old secrets" vibe of "Yellowjackets," but instead of horror, it's a comedy with the feral, silly strangeness of "Last Man on Earth," happy to bounce between real emotional intensity and gross-out humor. There are eight episodes, and they make for a spirited and not at all depressing binge.
... three hours, and what if the sky actually is falling?
'Extrapolations'
When to watch: Begins Friday, on Apple TV+.
This climate-crisis anthology drama is more interesting as a project than as a show, a parade of high-profile actors dutifully sermonizing about the impending death of our planet. The show's vision of the future is pretty much "now, but worse." The first episode is set 2037 and the eighth in 2070; global warming grows evermore destructive, and we see its effects through the eyes of loosely connected characters, including a tech billionaire, a truck driver in India and the world's last humpback whale, voiced by Meryl Streep. The first three episodes drop on Friday, and the rest arrive weekly.
... several hours, and 5, 6, 7, 8.
'Dance 100'
When to watch: Arrives Friday, on Netflix.
For those of us perpetually chasing the high of "America's Best Dance Crew," this new competition series scratches a similar itch. Eight choreographers, who also perform in their compositions, compete over six episodes, with 100 dancers allocated among them. But instead of relying on the typical "American Idol" judging style, this show has the dancers themselves give feedback and vote. It's an intriguing spin on the competition format, especially because the voting is done onstage, and one wonders if the power of social conformity and not just great moves is influencing the outcomes.

After 16 Years at Helm, Twitch's Chief Says He Is Stepping Down: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Emmett Shear was a co-founder of the Amazon-owned streaming service and managed it for 16 years.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Emmett Shear, the chief executive of the livestreaming site Twitch, said on Thursday that he was resigning, ending a 16-year tenure for the co-founder of the platform favored by video game enthusiasts.
Mr. Shear said in a blog post that he was stepping down because he had just had a child. He said that Dan Clancy, Twitch's president, would take over as chief executive, and that Mr. Shear would remain at Twitch in an advisory role.
"Twitch often feels to me like a child I've been raising as well," he wrote. "And while I will always want to be there if Twitch needs me, at 16 years old it feels to me Twitch is ready to move out of the house and venture alone."
Mr. Shear leaves a platform with big challenges, but also one that has grown drastically in recent years and become the cultural center of the video game world. Now, livestreamers who broadcast themselves gaming, cooking or chatting with fans can attract audiences of thousands and earn millions of dollars on the site, which is owned by Amazon.
The platform started in 2007 as Justin.tv, a livestreaming project following the life of Justin Kan, who started the site with Mr. Shear and two others. Mr. Shear wrote that he "thought at the time that we would most likely fail and give up in less than a year."
Instead, the site became a hub for live video and transitioned into Twitch in 2011, a place where video game players streamed their play. In 2014, Amazon bought the site for $ 1 billion.
As Twitch has grown, it has faced the same questions as other social platforms, such as how it should regulate harmful content and keep its users happy. It also faces the question of how best to cater to its star content creators, many of whom have been lured away to rival platforms like YouTube. In the past several years, Twitch creators have called out the platform for not doing enough to protect them from stalkers and online harassment, and complained that the site took too high a cut of their earnings.
Despite the controversy, Twitch has continued to thrive. The site now attracts seven million streamers each month and 31 million viewers daily.
Now, Mr. Clancy, who was already running the site's day-to-day operations, will take over. A longtime Google employee and Nextdoor executive, he lacks the video game background of Mr. Shear, a fervent player of the game StarCraft.
"It's a strength and a weakness," Mr. Clancy said of his lack of a gaming background in an interview last year. "It's a strength because I don't come to Twitch with these preconceived ideas of Twitch."

There’s a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it’s “The Five,” the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama “Yellowstone,” was last year’s most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber’s 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC — the first time in the network’s 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors’ careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that’s changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus — or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night — America’s news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
“The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now,” said Mosheh Oinounou, a former “CBS Evening News” executive producer. “It’s no different from traditional TV; the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show.”
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans older than 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans older than 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 — the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
“Unless there’s something super compelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch,” said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. “There’s so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ on streaming. It’s hard for the news to compete with Maverick.”
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few long-standing assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don’t necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were — and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day’s news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network’s new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing “fresh and unique perspectives to the news,” but it’s also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot by moving Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks and dismal ratings, Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, political analyst Alex Wagner, has struggled to build an audience. Her ratings in 2023 are tracking about 30% lower than what Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Melber and Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21% from a year prior, and CNN lost 33%.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2% from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’ biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults younger than 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of the Fox Corp., said at an investor conference last week. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its straight-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Watters’ 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that for generations summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Ex-Wells Fargo Executive May Be Headed to Prison
A former top Wells Fargo executive is likely headed to prison for her role in the sham accounts scandal that engulfed the bank six years ago. Carrie L. Tolstedt, Wells Fargo's former head of retail banking, agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge of obstructing a bank examination, the Justice Department said on Wednesday. The crime carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Ms. Tolstedt's plea agreement calls for a sentence of up to 16 months, the agency said. She is the first high-ranking Wells Fargo executive to be criminally charged over the bank's actions. Ms. Tolstedt ran Wells Fargo's banking branches during the years that the bank opened what may have been millions of sham bank accounts, a scandal that burst into public view in 2016 and toppled two successive chief executives. Ms. Tolstedt, 63, had consistently denied any wrongdoing. She retired from the bank shortly before its misdeeds became public, and was later retroactively fired for cause. STACY COWLEY

T-Mobile Acquires Mint, Part of Actor's Portfolio
Mint Mobile, partly owned by the actor Ryan Reynolds, is being acquired by T-Mobile as part of a cash-and-stock deal worth as much as $ 1.35 billion. T-Mobile's purchase of Ka'ena Corp. will give it access the budget wireless provider Mint, along with Ultra Mobile and wholesaler Plum. The brands, which already use T-Mobile for their network, will be run as a separate unit. The U.S. wireless carrier said Wednesday that it was acquiring the brands' sales, marketing, digital and service operations. It plans to use its supplier relationships and distribution scale to help grow the brands and offer competitive pricing and greater device inventory. T-Mobile's chief executive, Mike Sievert said the company planned to enhance Mint's already successful digital direct-toconsumer business. The actual price of the deal will depend on Ka'ena Corp.'s performance during certain periods before and after the closing. ASSOCIATED PRESS
START-UPS
Payments Provider Loses Value Despite Funding
Stripe, a San Francisco payments provider and one of the world's most valuable private companies, said Wednesday that it had raised new funding that values it at $ 50 billion, down from $ 95 billion in 2021, in a sign of how the air has come out of start-up dealmaking. The start-up, which provides payment processing software to companies including Amazon, raised $ 6.5 billion in its new financing from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Thrive Capital. Stripe, which said it didn't need the money to run its business, plans to use the funding to help employees sell their company shares and cover the taxes related to their stock compensation. The fall in Stripe's valuation reflects a difficult period for startups. Over the past year or so, start-up funding declined, and last year investments in U.S. start-ups dropped 31 percent to $ 238 billion, according to PitchBook. KALLEY HUANG

In Meta Plan For Layoffs, 10,000 Jobs Are Targeted: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It would be the tech company's second round of cuts since November. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has declared 2023 the "year of efficiency."
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a "year of efficiency."
The layoffs will affect Meta's recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company's website. The announcement is the company's second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta's hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.
"This will be tough and there's no way around that," he wrote.
Meta's stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.
Mr. Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or "managers managing managers." He said he took responsibility for last year's layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta's layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple's privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta's ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta's data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a "metaverse" company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Mr. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it's unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in A.I. for years but lately has not been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Mr. Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday's announcement of layoffs -- especially in the recruiting division -- felt "gut-punched," according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
"People are entering a job market that is the worst I've ever seen," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta's cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
"There's a lot of uncertainty," Ms. Sumner said. "There's a lot of anger, and there's the question many folks are asking: 'How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?"'
In his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Mr. Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Mr. Zuckerberg's crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange.
In his note, Mr. Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
"The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew and our growth slowed considerably," he said. "We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years."

Indie Studio Triumphs by Going Its Own Way: [National Desk]

Full text: The independent studio behind "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and "The Whale" became the first to sweep the acting awards and win best director and best picture in the same year.
Six years after nabbing the best picture Oscar for "Moonlight," the hip, art-house studio A24 succeeded at Sunday night's Academy Awards on a scale that seemed to surprise even its executives, who entered the post-show Governor's Ball with what-just-happened-looks on their faces.
The studio became the first in the 95-year history of the Oscars to capture the top six awards at once: the four acting categories, director and picture. It won nine trophies in all -- out of 18 nominations -- with seven, including best picture, going to "Everything Everywhere All at Once." That film, about a family of Asian immigrants who travel through a multiverse in their quest to find one another, was made for $ 20 million and grossed $ 106 million worldwide.
The acting awards went to Michelle Yeoh ("Everything Everywhere All at Once") and Brendan Fraser ("The Whale") in the lead categories, along with Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan, both from "Everything Everywhere All at Once," for their supporting roles. (Among those Mr. Fraser beat out was Paul Mescal, nominated for A24's "Aftersun," while Ms. Curtis faced her co-star Stephanie Hsu and Hong Chau from "The Whale.")
The filmmaking duo behind "Everything Everywhere All at Once," Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert -- known as the Daniels -- won the directing Oscar.
It signaled what could be a changing of the guard. The two studios that have long dominated the art film business, Searchlight Pictures and Focus Features, left the ceremony empty-handed. Searchlight's "The Banshees of Inisherin" was nominated for nine Oscars. Focus was behind "Tár," which was nominated for six.
Making A24's glittering night all the more notable is that it comes as the movie business is in disarray. Art-house theaters shut down at a rapid clip during the pandemic and the audience for adult-minded films is shrinking. Auteurs are increasingly turning to streaming services that offer more money and less stress. And the big studios are becoming even more risk-averse in what they are willing to put in theaters, churning out a steady stream of sequels and superhero films.
"I'm just so glad they exist because no one else is making the weird stuff that they are, and we all need that," Paul Rogers, who won the editing Oscar for "Everything Everywhere All at Once," said of A24 after entering the Governor's Ball. "We need to know, all the weirdos out there, that we're not alone. They're helping us and the world realize that it's OK to be strange. It's OK to be different. It's OK to tell different types of stories about different types of people than what we're used to seeing."
A24, named after an Italian highway, was founded in 2012 in New York City by three independent film executives. David Fenkel co-ran Oscilloscope Pictures; John Hodges, who has since left, started at USA Films; and Daniel Katz began his career at Lionsgate Films before leaving to run the film finance group at Guggenheim Partners.
Guggenheim was an early investor in the company. A year ago, A24 announced a $ 225 million equity investment that put the company's valuation at $ 2.5 billion and would allow it to expand its production and distribution operations. A24 declined to make any executives available to be interviewed for this article, reflecting a practiced counter-intuitiveness and general disinterest in Hollywood-style preening that has become part of its brand. The company issued a pat statement instead: "It was a special night. We're very proud and couldn't be happier for all of our winners."
The winners were happy, too. Several from the "Everything Everywhere All at Once" team gathered at the engraving table during the post-Oscars party in the Dolby Theater ballroom, including Ms. Curtis, and Mr. Kwan and Mr. Scheinert, who also won the Oscar for their original screenplay.
Mr. Scheinert handed his Oscar to his mother. "You want to carry it, Mom?" he asked. "People will be like, 'Ooh, who is she?"'
The room exploded when Mr. Quan, the personification of an only-in-Hollywood comeback story, jumped atop the table where the engraving of statuettes was taking place and let loose a guttural scream. It felt like a fitting exclamation point to a triumphant evening for his genre-bending film and the studio that helped make it a reality.
A24, which employs about 180 people, is now one of the few significant, truly independent studios left. It routinely takes chances on younger filmmakers with original ideas that are compelling to audiences, many of them in the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic, to head to the theater.
"To his credit, Daniel Katz had experience in the financial world and structured the company financially to thrive in the indie world while having a strong sense of the marketplace," said Stephen Gilula, the former co-chairman of Fox Searchlight. "Between him and his partners, they had an instinct to go even edgier -- moving into the indie fringes -- and they have proven a business that no one else has done, as a true independent, over time."
A24's success has come with a steady drumbeat of unlikely hits like Harmony Korine's "Spring Breakers," Sofia Coppola's "Bling Ring," Alex Garland's "Ex Machina," Robert Eggers's "The Witch," Yorgos Lanthimos's "The Lobster," Greta Gerwig's "Lady Bird," Lulu Wang's "The Farewell," Ari Aster's "Midsommar," the Safdie Brothers' "Uncut Gems," and Lee Isaac Chung's "Minari."
Darren Aronofsky, director of "The Whale," said he had the opportunity to sell his film to a streaming service for more money. He opted for A24 because of the company's commitment to theatrical distribution, even during the middle of the pandemic, when the future of movie theaters was uncertain.
"I felt like 'The Whale' in the theater would be a great experience because it would bring people together to feel in such a deep way and in a different way than the theater has been used for a very long time," Mr. Aronofsky said in an interview. "We used to have tear-jerkers back in the day, but that doesn't seem to be out there much anymore."
The film was made for $ 3 million and turned into a modest hit, with a worldwide gross of $ 37 million and Oscar nominations for Mr. Fraser and Ms. Chau. It also won the award for best makeup and hairstyling.
Mr. Aronofsky said what stood out about A24's approach was the studio's "attention to detail."
"It's clear that they love their movies and they're proud of their movies and I think that's how they choose their movies," he said. Mr. Aronofsky is currently partnered with A24 on the rerelease of his first film, "Pi."
Now, as the acclaim sets in, will the company, which is better capitalized than it has ever been, be able to maintain its taste level and its financial discipline? There is concern within the industry that they could begin delving into the more expensive, studio-level movies, much like Harvey Weinstein's Miramax did after its early Oscar triumphs.
The company's upcoming slate of films indicate it is sticking to its roots. The Australian horror film "Talk to Me" was just shown to rave reviews at the SXSW film festival and is scheduled to hit theaters this summer. Other films include Nicole Holofcener's "You Hurt My Feelings," starring Julia Louis Dreyfus; "Past Lives," from the writer-director Celine Song; and "Beau Is Afraid," starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by Mr. Aster.
A24 will also still have to compete with streaming companies like Apple, Amazon and Netflix. (A24 had a two-year production deal with Apple that expired.) Those services regularly compete with the traditional studios for big-budget films, but they have also shown themselves willing to dabble in more independent fare, like Apple TV+ did when it paid $ 20 million for "CODA," which won best picture last year.
"When you have Apple and Amazon, and still Netflix to an extent, who are distorting the marketplace, all of it ripples out," Mr. Gilula said.
"The economics for everyone now are really screwed up," he added. "So A24 has to continue doing indie movies, because as much money as they have, I don't think they can compete head-to-head with those other three."
To this point, A24 has managed to succeed by spending less and doing more. Unlike most studios, A24 does not rely on television ads to sell a movie. In fact, the studio may not take out any TV ads at all for a film. Instead, the company has mastered the art of finding a specific audience online and convincing them -- through clever social media content, for instance -- to evangelize for them. Their commitment to original work has become their calling card. Seeing A24's name attached to a film has begun to connote a certain standard of quality to a segment of the moviegoing audience and to the film industry.
Sunday night's triumph only emphasizes that.
"It's actually just amazing, what they've done," said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University's film school. "It's really art-house moviemaking that all of us probably thought was dead. And yet they're proving it is not. You can guarantee at this point that they're getting first dibs on any interesting, original, different non-mainstream screenplays."

Full text: In the highly competitive world of digital publishing, so-called service journalism publications like Lifehacker are valuable properties.
Lifehacker, the online how-to guide for exercise, cooking, technology, parenting -- and just about everything else -- is being sold to the digital-media giant Ziff Davis, according to two people with knowledge of the deal.
The site is being sold by G/O Media, which owns Lifehacker and several other remnants of Gawker Media, including the tech site Gizmodo and the automotive site Jalopnik. Great Hill Partners, a private-equity company, purchased those sites from the Spanish-language media company Univision and renamed the collection G/O Media.
The price of Lifehacker could not be learned. The sale is expected to be announced later this week, the people said.
G/O Media and Ziff Davis had no immediate comment.
Ziff Davis approached G/O Media in recent months seeking to purchase the site to complement its existing portfolio of publications, which include Mashable, PC Magazine and IGN, according to one of the people. (Ziff Davis had been an interested bidder in the former Gawker sites when they were up for sale.)
In the highly competitive world of digital publishing, so-called service journalism publications like Lifehacker, which the entrepreneur and blogger Gina Trapani founded in 2005, are valuable properties because they attract readers who are interested in advertiser-friendly categories. Many readers who visit from search engines like Google are interested in buying a product that solves a problem, allowing sites like Lifehacker to earn a commission by referring visitors to a product sold at e-commerce destinations like Amazon.
Nick Denton, Gawker's founder, was particularly fond of Lifehacker. In a 2014 memo announcing a new leadership team for the company, Mr. Denton called the blog -- a reliable driver of web traffic and ad revenue -- "oh, beloved Lifehacker."

A24 Achieves Art-House Supremacy With Triumphant Oscar Night

Six years after nabbing the best picture Oscar for “Moonlight,” the hip, art-house studio A24 succeeded at Sunday night’s Academy Awards on a scale that seemed to surprise even its executives, who entered the post-show Governor’s Ball with what-just-happened-looks on their faces.
The studio became the first in the 95-year history of the Oscars to capture the top six awards at once: the four acting categories, director and picture. It won nine trophies in all — out of 18 nominations — with seven, including best picture, going to “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” That film, about a family of Asian immigrants who travel through a multiverse in their quest to find one another, was made for $20 million and grossed $106 million worldwide.
The acting awards went to Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) and Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”) in the lead categories, along with Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan, both from “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” for their supporting roles. (Among those Fraser beat out was Paul Mescal, nominated for A24’s “Aftersun,” while Curtis faced her co-star Stephanie Hsu and Hong Chau from “The Whale.”)
The filmmaking duo behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert — known as the Daniels — won the directing Oscar.

Nothing Unexpected To See Here, Folks: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A show that's become a shrink-wrapped, anodyne exercise stuck safely to the script.
To paraphrase Greta Garbo, give me back my slap.
No, of course onstage assaults are unacceptable. But the 95th Academy Awards could have used a jolt of some kind as they wound their way through three and a half hours on Sunday night. There was a crisis team in place to handle the fallout from any unexpected catastrophes like Will Smith's attack on Chris Rock at last year's show, but there was nothing it could do about the ordinariness and sameness of the ABC broadcast.
The audience in the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles roared for the early victories of sentimental favorites like Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis of "Everything Everywhere All at Once" (for best supporting actor and actress) and the late -- very late -- victories of the film's writers and directors, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, and star, Michelle Yeoh. And their speeches were stirring. But at the end of the now endless awards season, we knew that they would be, and we had a pretty good idea what they would say.
There is now, through no one's individual fault, a consistently promotional, exhortatory, shrink-wrapped feeling to the Oscars. After the depredations of streaming video and Covid-19, no chances are being taken. Jimmy Kimmel, reviving the role of the solo Oscar host, got off some good lines in his monologue -- the movies are still distinct from television because "a TV show can't lose $ 100 million." (Though in the age of Netflix and Amazon, is that true?) But on balance it was safe, with the sharp jibes reserved for easy targets who weren't there, like James Cameron and Tom Cruise. ("L. Ron Hubba Hubba," maybe the best line of the night.)
Kimmel addressed Smith's slap at length without really talking about it. He focused on what would happen in the extremely unlikely event anyone went rogue this year, pointing out performers in the audience whose screen characters were brutal enforcers -- Pedro Pascal of "The Mandalorian," Michael B. Jordan of "Creed III" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever." It was an odd way to signal that violence was unwelcome.
(Smith, last year's best-actor winner, was replaced as a presenter for the lead acting awards by Halle Berry.)
In current fashion, the show opened not with a production number but a film montage, in this case a series of behind-the-scenes clips from nominated films. The attempt to hook audiences by bringing them inside the process of filmmaking and award-giving was also reflected in the deconstructed see-through set.
This contemporary feint toward inclusiveness -- if they can't nominate more female directors, at least they can make viewers feel as if they're getting an inside look -- contrasts, for better and worse, with the glossy insiders' party that the Oscars used to be.
The surely unintentional effect, in a broadcast that sang the praises of the theater experience, is to make the movies feel smaller -- more suited for the laptop screen and the Netflix interface. Winners don't stick in the mind they way they used to. Did you remember that "Dune" took home six awards last year, twice as many as any other film? Or that "CODA" won best picture? (You're welcome.)
In this context, the purely promotional segments on Sunday -- a long plug for the Academy museum, a creaky salute to Warner Bros.' 100th anniversary -- felt right at home but also, in their reinforcement of the show's lumpen unremarkableness, more irritating than ever.
And seemingly harmless attempts to signal virtue can backfire, as in Kimmel's awkward and eventually condescending exchange with Malala Yousafzai.
As always, there were moments that pierced the veil. The victory of "Navalny" in the documentary feature category, while its subject, the dissident Alexei Navalny, languishes in a Russian prison, was indelible. Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Paul Dano were polished and funny in their presentation of costume design; the award's winner, Ruth Carter of "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," movingly invoked her mother, who had just died at the age of 101, asking the actor Chadwick Boseman to look for her in the afterlife. Yeoh, given carte blanche to emote, showed that feeling could be conveyed in an acceptance speech that was largely polished and non-self-aggrandizing.
David Byrne injected a welcome note of weirdness, if not musicality, in the performance of the best-song nominee "This Is a Life" from "Everything Everywhere All at Once." The production number "Naatu Naatu" from "RRR," Lady Gaga's unplugged performance of "Hold My Hand" from "Top Gun: Maverick" and Rihanna's rendition of "Lift Me Up" from "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" were unimpeachably professional. But the musical highlight of the night was undoubtedly the snatch of the Carpenters' "Top of the World" sung by the composer M.M. Keeravani when "Naatu Naatu" won best song.
When Kimmel wasn't forced to ad-lib, he and his writers were generally on point. A call for audience votes on whether Robert Blake should be included in the In Memoriam segment was slyly handled. (He wasn't.) A joke about the editing of footage from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol didn't mention Tucker Carlson or Fox News but made its point.
The good moments, however, couldn't change my sense that the modern Oscars have become something more to be endured than enjoyed. If you wanted a glimpse of the zeitgeist on Sunday night, HBO ("The Last of Us") and TLC ("MILF Manor") were the places to look.

Full text: "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Avatar: The Way of Water" were popular with everyone, everywhere, all at once.
Four Quadrant
/fôr kwŏ-drənt/
A catchall descriptor for a popular movie that prompts all demographics to buy a ticket -- young, old, female, male. (Hollywood being Hollywood, "old" can start at 25.)
In 1998, two seemingly unrelated things happened in the film business. More than 57 million people -- a record number -- watched the Academy Awards, and later that year the term "four-quadrant movie" appeared for the first time in Hollywood trade newspapers.
A quarter-century later, chatter about the Oscars and "quads" has melded into a single, somewhat desperate conversation.
Declining viewership for the Academy Awards has become an embarrassment to Hollywood. In 2021, more people watched the "National Dog Show" (11 million) than they tuned in for the Oscars (10 million). The numbers improved last year, but they were not enough to stop the Hollywood hand wringing: Why don't people like to watch us celebrate ourselves anymore? Yes, fine, awards shows in general have fallen out of fashion. But we can't play second fiddle to poodles!
One reason for declining interest involves the nominated films, according to TV analysts. People at home want something to root for -- something they have actually seen. "Titanic," one of the biggest blockbusters of all time, was named best picture in 1998, which boosted Nielsen ratings for the Oscars telecast. In recent years, as the celebrated films have become niche ("Moonlight," "Nomadland," "CODA"), so has the viewership.
This year, though, the nominees for best picture include "two colossal four-quadrant hits," as Rich Gelfond, chief executive of IMAX, recently put it.
Those movies, "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Avatar: The Way of Water," were popular with everyone, everywhere. This will be the first time that the nominee pool for best picture has included more than one billion-dollar ticket seller, according to box office databases. "Maverick" has collected $ 1.5 billion and "The Way of Water" has earned $ 2.3 billion.
Dividing moviegoers into four groups, with 25 as the age split, first became a Hollywood obsession in the late 1980s. Research firms had started to conduct moviegoer surveys to track the effectiveness of studio spending on TV ads -- older men are not being persuaded by your commercials for "Porky's Revenge," but young guys are in the bag. (Or whatever.) The age demarcation was based on Nielsen data, according to Kevin Goetz, chief executive of the film research company Screen Engine/ASI.
In the 1990s, as the audience began to fragment, the broader film industry turned four-quadrant into shorthand for mass appeal. "Tent pole" started to replace the term by 2010, but four quadrant has made a comeback. One theory about why: An increasing number of TV executives have been promoted to positions of power in moviedom, perhaps turning to an older film term as a way to seem experienced and to justify spending colossal sums to make movies for streaming services. Amazon Studios, for instance, has described "Red One," a coming vehicle for Dwayne Johnson, as a "globe-trotting, four-quadrant, action-adventure comedy."
"It's a bit antiquated," Mr. Goetz said, noting that his moviegoer research has long since expanded beyond a four-way split. "But you still hear it all the time."

Ex-Fox Employee Guilty In Broadcast Bribe Case: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The employee, Hernán López, and an Argentine marketing firm were accused of helping make illegal payments for rights to tournaments in South America.
After hearing seven weeks of often-impenetrable testimony about television contracts, codes of ethics and the interpretation of Spanish phrases in emails sent more than a dozen years ago, a federal jury in Brooklyn on Thursday convicted a former Fox employee and an Argentine sports marketing firm of paying bribes in exchange for lucrative soccer broadcasting contracts.
Prosecutors said that Hernán López, who until 2016 worked for a unit of what was then known as 21st Century Fox, had taken part in a complex scheme to make millions of dollars in secret annual payments to the presidents of national soccer federations in order to secure the rights to the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana, widely viewed South American soccer tournaments. Full Play Group, the marketing firm, stood accused of similar but far more extensive corruption. Prosecutors said it paid bribes for the rights to World Cup qualifiers, exhibition matches, the Copa América tournament and the Copa Libertadores.
The government also argued that López had taken advantage of "loyalty secured through the payment of bribes" to secure inside information that helped Fox beat out ESPN in its bid for the United States broadcasting rights for the 2018 and 2022 men's World Cups -- a theory Fox has vigorously denied. Fox was never accused of any wrongdoing.
López, who holds dual American and Argentine citizenship, was convicted on one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of wire fraud conspiracy and faces up to 40 years in prison. Full Play was convicted on six fraud and money laundering counts and, as a corporation, could face financial penalties.
A third defendant, Carlos Martínez, who worked under López at Fox, was acquitted on counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.
The convictions represent what Breon S. Peace, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, called "a resounding victory" in the Justice Department's sweeping investigation of corruption in international soccer.
After a secret inquiry began in 2010, the case broke into public view in May 2015 when sensational predawn arrests were made in Zurich, the city that FIFA, soccer's world governing body, calls home. Since then, more than two dozen individuals and entities have voluntarily pleaded guilty to a wide variety of charges, including racketeering and wire fraud. And in 2017, a different federal jury convicted two soccer officials, from Paraguay and Brazil, on wire fraud conspiracy and other charges.
Prosecutors indicted López, Martínez and Full Play in March 2020, signaling that the long-running case -- which shook FIFA to the core and resulted in a shakeout of several generations of leadership in its ranks -- still had legs.
"The defendants cheated by bribing soccer officials to act in their own greedy interests rather than in the best interests of the sport," Peace said in a statement following the verdict. Judge Pamela K. Chen rejected a request from prosecutors that López be taken immediately into custody, instead releasing him with tightened bond restrictions. A sentencing date has not been set.
John Gleeson, a lawyer for López, said in a statement that "we are obviously disappointed with the jury's verdict."
He continued, "The proceedings have involved both legal and factual errors, and we look forward to vindicating our client on appeal." Lopez, who left Fox in early 2016, went on to found the podcasting company Wondery, which was sold to Amazon in 2020 in a deal that valued the company at a reported $ 300 million.
Carlos Ortiz, a lawyer for Full Play, declined to comment. The company was founded by an Argentine father and son, Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, who were charged in 2015 but were not extradited. A lawyer for Hugo Jinkis said he could not immediately comment on the news.
"We are very grateful for the jury's service," Steven McCool, Martínez's lead lawyer, said in a brief call after the verdict. "Carlos received justice today and it was a long time coming."
Thursday's verdict came on the fourth day of deliberations after a complex and slow-moving trial. Jurors were presented with reams of contracts, financial spreadsheets and bank transfer statements, as well as expert witnesses who debated whether a particular phrase meant "pay him less" or "pay it less."
At one point, early in the trial, Judge Chen admonished the lead prosecutor, Kaitlin T. Farrell, for reading entire emails about corporate issues into the official record, warning that she risked losing the jury's attention.
And as in the first trial in the case, the government relied particularly heavily on a single star witness: Alejandro Burzaco, the former chief executive of the Argentine sports marketing and TV production firm Torneos, who pleaded guilty in the case in 2015 and has been cooperating with the U.S. government since.
Over 11 days of testimony, he described in painstaking and sometimes stultifying detail the esoteric series of shell companies and phony contracts that had been used to pay bribes to soccer officials through a joint venture owned by Torneos and 21st Century Fox. Although he personally arranged the payments, Burzaco said he had informed both López and Martínez about their existence and said that neither executive had done anything to halt them.
Burzaco also detailed using a relationship cultivated through bribes paid to Julio Grondona -- a FIFA vice president and a longtime president of Argentina's soccer association who died in 2014 -- to gain inside information that helped Fox win the U.S. English-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. ESPN had long held that coveted property.
Although bidding was supposed to have been blind, Burzaco said he had asked Grondona in late 2011 for help at López's request. Burzaco testified that Grondona had "told me if Fox puts $ 400 million, they are going to award it to Fox -- tell your friends." Fox ultimately paid $ 425 million, and several years later obtained rights to the 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Over howls of protest from defense lawyers, prosecutors called the former ESPN president John Skipper to testify about the incident. "I was disappointed," he said. "In fact, I was angry."
In a statement after the verdict, a Fox spokesman said, "This case does not involve Fox Corporation, and it was made clear that there was no connection to Fox's successful World Cup bids." The company has in the past noted that the unit where López and Martínez worked, Fox International Channels, was spun off in 2019 and that it was a different division, Fox Sports, that was charged with negotiating for those rights.
Although both López and Martínez maintained their innocence, claiming they were never aware any bribes had been paid, Full Play took a decidedly different tack. Its lawyers readily admitted that the company had made regular payments to Latin American soccer officials but claimed that those payments had not been bribes but simply the standard way of doing business when it came to South American soccer.
Ortiz, the lawyer for Full Play, said in his closing arguments late last week: "You can look at it and, say, hey, do I like this morally? Do I think this is appropriate?" But, he added, "all of these executives and officers acted in a manner and behaved and carried themselves in a manner that sent a clear, strong message that their receipts of payments were totally fine."

Everything Everywhere All Up for Auction: [Style Desk]

Full text: Hot dog hands, a raccoon puppet and other oddities from the multiverse fetched thousands of dollars in an online auction of props from "Everything Everywhere All at Once."
The free market has assessed the value of the prosthetic hot dog hands that appeared in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" as $ 55,000 -- or $ 5,500 per sausagey finger.
That price was determined in a weeklong auction that ended Thursday, in which the independent film studio A24 sold 43 lots of props and costumes from the movie. The reality- and genre-bending film, which is nominated for 11 Oscars, stars Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant and laundromat owner trying to save a dizzying multiverse from ruin.
Bidders claimed the Elvis costume worn by the stylish villain Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu) and the lip balm that Evelyn's husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), uses to zip between universes. Bidding peaked at $ 60,000 for an suggestively shaped "auditor of the month" trophy that first appears on the desk of an I.R.S. bureaucrat (Jamie Lee Curtis) but winds up somewhere else altogether. The Wang family's laundry-delivery R.V. sold for $ 11,000 to a buyer who should not expect to drive it anytime soon.
"This needs new transmission, engine, tires and serious T.L.C. on the interior," the lot's description warned. "The R.V. is currently not street legal."
No memento proved more desirable than a raccoon puppet nicknamed Raccacoonie that, at $ 90,000, was the auction's highest-selling item. The puppet figures in a recurring gag about Disney and Pixar's "Ratatouille," one of several eclectic cinematic references dotted throughout by the film's directors, Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan.
Proceeds from the auction, which totaled $ 555,725, will be donated to three organizations: the Asian Mental Health Project, which aims to make mental health care more accessible in Asian American communities; the Transgender Law Center, which champions the rights and safety of transgender and gender-nonconforming people; and the Laundry Workers Center, which works to improve conditions for laundry, warehouse and food service workers. A24 declined to release the names of the winning bidders.
Jason Kisvarday, the film's production designer, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was surprised to see so many of the items going for thousands of dollars. "There's usually not a lot of demand or interest in these types of things after the movie comes out," he said.
The galaxy-brain nature of the film's plot demanded equally absurd props and costumes, which have resonated with fans. The multiverse was made chic by the costume designer Shirley Kurata, while Mr. Kisvarday oversaw the department that bought or created most of the other items for sale in the auction.
Some were easier to procure than others. A pair of gloves for the hot dog hands were cut from a sweater and hot-glued together by Allison Trautman, the art department coordinator. An umbrella covered in doughnuts was secured by Joshua Bramer, the prop master. The hot dog hands themselves, along with Raccacoonie, were created by the special effects and makeup artist Jason Hamer.
Mr. Kisvarday took other projects into his own, non-hot-dog-shaped hands. He visited a stone supplier in Pasadena, Calif., with the film's directors to select about 10 rocks that at one point replace the human characters. They were looking for "neat and interesting" rocks that could be thrown down a hill, he said.
One of them, accessorized with googly eyes that Mr. Kisvarday ordered from Amazon, sold on Thursday for $ 13,200. "It's not because it's a rock," he said, "it's because of how many people saw the rock, are excited about this rock, and it means something to them."
In addition to its charitable goals, the auction also advances A24's efforts to build a recognizable brand with cultural cachet. Since the studio was founded in 2012, it has been responsible not just for hits ("Euphoria," "Lady Bird") but also for a growing offering of beanies and hoodies meant to appeal to the Letterboxd and Criterion Collection crowd. The studio has previously auctioned off items from "Midsommar" and "Uncut Gems," including, yes, an "iced out" Furby pendant.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once" has made more than $ 100 million worldwide since its release in March, making it A24's highest-grossing title.
The auction generated buzz for the film during an awards season in which it has become an unexpected heavyweight. The film picked up honors at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and leads the pack with 11 Oscar nominations, including for best picture, best director, best actress (Ms. Yeoh), best supporting actress (Ms. Hsu and Ms. Curtis) and best supporting actor (Mr. Quan).
Awards season has been "absolutely bonker-pants," Mr. Kisvarday said.
Although Mr. Kisvarday expected many of the items in the auction to be sold to private collectors, he said he hoped that some, like the family R.V., would land somewhere publicly accessible like a museum.
"I think it's fun when mementos like this wind up in places where many people can see and enjoy them," he said.

On Dating Apps, Podcast Bros Find Dead Air: [Style Desk]

Full text: Their reputations have caught up with them.
T'Azane Roberson, a student at California State University, Northridge, was approaching one year of on-again, off-again dating with a co-worker when she came to a realization she would eventually announce to her followers on Twitter: "My biggest mistake in life so far was dating a man with a podcast."
Ms. Roberson, 24, began seeing him in December 2021. He was 35 at the time and had dreams of being a social media influencer, she recalled. They both worked at an Amazon warehouse near her home in Lancaster, Calif. The "situationship," as she aptly called it, was "very embarrassing," but she continued to date him until January of this year.
"I knew he had a podcast, but I had never listened to it," she said. "I was like, OK, I like this man. I'm already ignoring his social media presence. I'm just going to forget he has a podcast."
Things were fine when they were together, so long as Ms. Roberson didn't think about his extracurriculars. Until one day he sent her a link to his show, inviting her to listen and share her thoughts. What she heard turned her off.
For Ms. Roberson, it wasn't just the content of the man's podcast, but that he had one at all. Like many other women, she associates the form with a certain kind of man: one who is endlessly fascinated by his own opinions, loves the sound of his own voice and isn't the least bit shy about offering unsolicited opinions on masculinity, sexuality and women. Many women have taken to social media to mock just that kind of programming and the men who make it.
On TikTok, hashtags like #menwithpodcasts gather videos of (mostly) women using a beard filter to satirize the sorts of things male podcast hosts say, such as: "Why, as a man, are you born in the month of February?" or "That's the problem with women who read." Others have called on them to "put down the mics" and "get a job!"
With the once-booming podcast industry currently on the back foot and hosts' reputations for self-important mansplaining having long since caught up with them, is the "podcast bro" officially a persona non grata in today's dating landscape?
In interviews with a handful of men who work or have worked in podcasting, some said they had come across romantic prospects who view their profession as a potential red flag. And even among those who haven't, some pre-emptively adjust their presentation of themselves to make a clear distinction.
Tyree Rush, a 29-year-old podcast producer in Atlanta, said he makes it a point not to list his profession on his dating-app profiles. Instead, he usually says he works in digital media.
"I was on a date in Chicago and I said that I said that I do digital strategy at first," he recalled in an interview. "So she kept pressing and I was like, 'Actually, I produce podcasts.' Now, maybe it's because I lied and said I did digital strategy first that she was not into it, but I also just think when she heard podcast, it was a cause of concern for her."
Mr. Rush added that she followed with, "don't tell me you're like doing like a Joe Budden podcast or anything like that."
Scrutiny of the podcast bro archetype has also appeared in other areas of pop culture. In the Netflix comedy "You People," Ezra, a white broker played by Jonah Hill, reveals to his date that his dream job is to do his hip-hop culture podcast full time, which is first met with laughter, followed quickly by judgment and concern.
Mr. Rush, who has worked for Marvel, iHeartMedia and the podcast network Wondery, said he understood the wariness, given the many things women have to be afraid of when it comes to dating men; a podcast is just another thing to worry about.
"It's like a new chivalry or etiquette that we're trying to figure out," he said.
Logan Mendoza, 23, is one of four hosts of SweeTalks, a video podcast on YouTube. He said they often get direct messages from men who enjoy their content, which he described as mostly "guy talk" and debate. He said he didn't consider SweeTalks to be like some of the more offensive shows.
"At the end of the day, you want to entertain the listeners and the viewers, so to do that you're going to have to say some crazy stuff," said Mr. Mendoza, who lives in Orange County, Calif. "Sometimes we'll say stuff, but we don't really fall in line with it. Sometimes we'll disagree on a topic just to have that argument with each other on the podcast and have different point of views."
Raymond Pang, a 31-year-old podcast producer and sound designer who works mostly on science shows, said he had never personally experienced romantic rejection because of his profession. In fact, he said, it was often a point of entry into conversation.
About a month ago he started seeing someone new, but while he was single, he presented himself as an audio producer. As someone who has also worked in public radio, he felt the audio label encompassed both jobs. "I feel like I have been able to position myself away from the terrible-man corner of podcasting," he said in an interview.
Mr. Pang said he didn't know of many people who work in audio who would call themselves "podcasters," though, given the unappealing idea that "anybody can be a podcaster."
"It could mean that you work at This American Life or it could mean that you record a podcast with a bunch of your friends to talk about the latest week of football games or something like that, or worse -- like, misogynistic stuff," he said.
For her part, Ms. Roberson, the Cal State student, said that after her experience she would never again date a man in podcasts: "Absolutely not."

The Film Studio A24 Buys the Cherry Lane Theater: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The studio's first venture into live performance follows the move by Audible, Amazon's audio subsidiary, to stage works at the nearby Minetta Lane Theater.
A24, the independent film and television studio barreling into next weekend's Academy Awards with a boatload of Oscar nominations, is making an unexpected move into live performance, purchasing a small Off Broadway theater in New York's West Village.
The studio, which until now has focused on making movies, television shows and podcasts, has purchased the Cherry Lane Theater for $ 10 million, and plans to present plays as well as other forms of live entertainment there, in addition to the occasional film screening.
A24, whose films include the leading Oscar contender "Everything Everywhere All at Once," is not the first film studio to make such a move: the Walt Disney Company has been presenting stage productions at Broadway's New Amsterdam Theater, which it leases from the state and city, since 1997. But Disney, of course, is an entertainment industry behemoth that has mastered the art of multiplatform storytelling.
A more comparable move, perhaps, was that by Audible, an Amazon audio subsidiary that since 2018 has been leasing the Minetta Lane Theater, in Greenwich Village, for live productions which it then records and offers on its digital platform. And Netflix, the streaming juggernaut, has in recent years taken over several cinemas, including the Paris Theater in New York, as well as the Egyptian and Bay theaters in Los Angeles.
The A24 acquisition, coming at a time when many theaters are still struggling to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, suggests a vote of confidence in live performance. A24 plans to present some events celebrating Cherry Lane's centennial this spring, and then to close the theater for renovations before beginning full-scale programming next year.
Much remains uncertain about how the company intends to use the theater. A24 declined to make anyone available to speak on the record about the acquisition, but an official there said that the company had not yet decided whether it would develop work for the stage, or present work developed by others. The official, who was granted anonymity to describe the company's plans, said that the studio hoped the theater would allow it to strengthen existing relationships with writers and performers who work on stage and screen, and to develop new relationships with comedians and theater artists.
A24 plans to retain the theater's existing staff while adding to it with its own team, the official said, and as part of the renovation it plans to install technology so the theater can be used for film screenings.
The official said A24's theater venture is a partnership with Taurus Investment Holdings.
"I really believe my theater is going into the right hands," said Angelina Fiordellisi, who has owned the theater since 1996. "They love to develop and produce the work of emerging writers, and a lot of their writers are playwrights. I can't imagine a better way to bring future life to the theater."
Fiordellisi, 68, has been trying to sell the theater for some time. "I don't want to work that hard anymore," she said, "and I want to spend more time with my family."
The purchase, which was previously reported by Curbed, includes three attached properties, including a 179-seat theater, a 60-seat theater and eight apartments, on the Village's picturesque, curving Commerce Street. The Cherry Lane, in a 19th-century building that was a brewery and a box factory before being converted to theatrical use in 1923, bills itself as the city's longest continually running Off Broadway theater.
In 2021, Fiordellisi agreed to sell the property to the Lucille Lortel Theater for $ 11 million, but the sale fell apart. Last week, Lortel announced that it had spent $ 5.3 million to purchase a three-story carriage house in Chelsea, where it plans to open a 61-seat theater in 2025. The Lortel organization also has a 295-seat theater in the West Village.
The Cherry Lane will now be a for-profit, commercial venture; Fiordellisi had operated it through a nonprofit, occasionally presenting work that she developed and more often renting it to nonprofit and commercial producers. Fiordellisi said she will convert her nonprofit to a foundation that will give grants to playwrights and small theater companies.

Gen Z Is Mystified: My Instagram Posts Are Also on Facebook: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Teenagers and young adults are flummoxed. The reason it keeps happening involves an online prompt and product design.
More than a decade ago, Qu'ana Underwood, then a middle school student in Philadelphia, joined Facebook. But as other social media platforms appeared, Facebook "became an afterthought," she said.
Then last March, after Ms. Underwood posted photos of herself at a university formal on Instagram, she was suddenly flooded with Facebook notifications from relatives and friends she doesn't normally keep in touch with. Her Instagram post had also appeared on her Facebook profile, prompting her Facebook friends to like and comment on it.
Ms. Underwood said she was mystified by what was happening, especially when every post or story she shared on Instagram ended up on Facebook -- even though she couldn't remember the last time she had posted there.
"What is going on?" Ms. Underwood, a 22-year-old behavioral health specialist in Nashville, said she had asked herself.
Like Ms. Underwood, other teenagers and young adults have discovered in recent months that they've been unusually active on Facebook -- even though they hadn't opened the app. Some were shocked, they said, because they hadn't used Facebook for years and were hearing from Facebook friends they had forgotten about, with no idea how to stop their Instagram posts from winding up on the older social network.
The surge in Facebook activity is rooted in a new feature from Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Last year, Meta introduced a prompt that popped up on Instagram when people posted a photo or story. The prompt asked Instagram users if they wanted to share their post to Facebook, too.
To make the prompt go away, users had to click a big blue button to agree to share their Instagram posts on Facebook, or a smaller hyperlink to opt out. Many people, including Ms. Underwood, clicked the more visible blue button -- and then immediately forgot about it, according to interviews with more than a dozen Gen Z and millennial Instagram users. Reversing the setting requires clicking through multiple Instagram menus.
"It feels so sneaky," said Ashley LaBossiere, 28, a digital media manager in Canton, Ga., who has had trouble turning off the setting. "Is Facebook suffering so badly?"
Meta has long been concerned about losing teenagers and young adults to rivals like TikTok and Snapchat, especially since that audience is highly coveted by advertisers. Facebook, which Mark Zuckerberg created in 2004 while at Harvard, was aimed at college students in its early years but has struggled in recent years with an aging user base.
Last year, 17 percent of Facebook users were 18 to 24 years old, compared with 44 percent who were older than 45, according to Data.ai, an analytics company. In contrast, 28 percent of Instagram users were 18 to 24 and 33 percent were older than 45, while 39 percent of Snapchat users and 30 percent of TikTok users were 18 to 24.
To appeal to younger users, Instagram and Facebook have in recent years introduced features like Stories, which emulates a Snapchat feature by letting people post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. They also rolled out Reels, a TikTok-like feature that lets people create short videos.
Last year, Instagram engineers were told that Meta wanted more people to post from Instagram to Facebook, said three people involved with the project, who were not authorized to speak publicly. That led to the new prompt, which was designed so most users would give Instagram permission to permanently share their posts with Facebook, they said. The prompt was placed where thumbs typically fall on a screen, one of the people said.
Meta declined to comment on what had led to the prompt and its design. But the company said not all Instagram users received the prompt and acknowledged that some had to decline multiple times before Instagram stopped asking. Meta also said a software bug last year caused some users to see the prompt every time they posted on Instagram.
"We know that people enjoy cross-posting content to easily share with their friends and followers across our apps," a spokeswoman for Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Messenger, said in a statement.
Tech companies have long encouraged users to stay on their services by tweaking their products, said Tony Hu, who teaches product design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One example are the pop-up windows that people click once to accept all internet cookies, which collect their data and track them online, he said. Another is how Amazon made it easy to buy items with just one click, he said.
Referring to Meta's prompt, Mr. Hu said, "Maybe they are just nudging people to share because that drives their viewership, ad revenue."
For some teenagers and young adults, unintentionally posting on Facebook from Instagram has resulted in mild embarrassment and mad dashes to undo the sharing.
In January, said Ms. LaBossiere, the digital media manager, she rushed to delete a post about narcissistic mothers that she had shared on Instagram and had ended up on her Facebook profile, because she didn't want her mother's friends to see it.
Ms. LaBossiere considers herself tech savvy but has lost count of the times she has declined to share from Instagram to Facebook, only to accidentally do so again, she said.
"Maybe I don't know what I'm doing," she said. "That's when I start feeling like I'm 100 years old."
Mia Bramel, 23, a software engineer in Santa Clara, Calif., said she had deliberately kept her Instagram and Facebook accounts separate -- only for the prompt to upend that. On Instagram, she said, she typically shares photos of nature and videos of herself practicing piano pieces. On Facebook, which she uses less frequently, she shares life updates like graduating from college.
"I always feel very aware of who is viewing anything," she said. "I feel like the things that I post on Instagram are only really meant for the people who follow me. If it were on Facebook, it would feel really weird."
But now a selfie or an "artistic and experimental" Instagram post sometimes winds up on Facebook. That makes it feel harder to "control" her social media presence, Ms. Bramel said.
Others have embraced the sharing of Instagram posts on Facebook. Loren Cantor, 22, a student and musician in Montreal, said the new setting had been a "pleasant surprise" because it helped him keep in touch with family.
In 2011, Mr. Cantor joined Facebook, where his most active friends are his family. He joined Instagram in 2013, and his followers there are friends from school and from making music. When he started accidentally cross-posting, he said, he started hearing more from his grandmother and aunt.
"Facebook is a more family-oriented thing for the older generations who aren't on these other apps," he said. "I really don't know what's going on on Facebook."

Low in Carbs, but Very Conspicuous: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The statement jacket designed by Rachel Antonoff and patterned with farfalle has become a social-media and street-style sensation.
When Bani Randhawa started wearing her new coat a few months ago, something funny happened: Strangers smiled at her as they passed. Babies in strollers pointed at her. Others stopped her on the street, all with the same question: Is that farfalle on your jacket?
"I have never experienced that while wearing another article of clothing," said Ms. Randhawa, 27, who attends business school in Cambridge, Mass. The coat in question is the Rachel Antonoff Parker Puffer, a short, black jacket printed with golden images of bow-tie pasta.
In a sea of drab, black winter coats, the pasta puffer stands alone. "You are that girl when you wear it," Ms. Randhawa said.
The coat has suddenly become a seasonal phenomenon in cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Social media is littered with photos of people posing in it. The actress Mindy Kaling has worn it. So has the actor Dylan O'Brien. The farfalle has become Rachel Antonoff's best-selling print, and the jacket -- which retails for $ 425 -- has sold out three times since it was introduced at the end of 2021, said Ms. Antonoff.
"I feel like a winter coat with pasta all over it is a little bit of joy," she said.
This winter, the pasta puffer has been especially conspicuous. Lauren Goldstein, 26, who works in social media and marketing in Manhattan and owns the coat, said this could be a result of the unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country, which allows for outerwear that prioritizes fashion over function.
The pasta coat is "my entire personality this winter," she said.
It's not unheard-of for outerwear to develop a cult following (see: the $ 100-ish Amazon Coat that took New York by storm in 2018). But the pasta puffer seems more niche.
"Before the pandemic, we were very often told, 'This is way too loud, too much, this doesn't merchandise,' " said Ms. Antonoff, who has been making food-themed garments like babka sweaters and dresses decorated with seafood towers since 2015. Then the lockdowns happened, and many people spending their workdays on Zoom calls were looking for a way to provoke conversation. "We noticed that people are being seen from waist up, and they wanted to have a big bagel on their sweater."
The excitement for those styles has remained, she said.
Laura Nguyen, an account executive in Brooklyn Heights, said that during the pandemic she grew tired of her "bluish-gray professional clothes" from Ann Taylor. She decided to refresh her wardrobe, and at the end of 2021 rented the pasta puffer from the website Rent the Runway.
"Adding food into patterns and fashion is like the new florals," said Ms. Nguyen, 25.
Sam Hwang, 25, who lives in Huntington Beach, Calif., and also owns the coat, said its popularity speaks to the way many people are more body-positive, and make their favorite dishes part of their identity. Other designers, like Lisa Says Gah and Susan Alexandra, have drawn attention for their food-themed fashion.
Rental companies have also played a role in the pasta puffer's ubiquity. The coat has been rented more than 1,000 times through the clothing rental service Nuuly. On Rent the Runway, rentals of the coat grew by 10 percent from fall and winter of 2021 to the same period in 2022 -- a rarity for any item of clothing, said Jennifer Hyman, the company's co-founder and chief executive.
A bold jacket like the pasta puffer is ideal for temporary ownership, said Sarah Margulies, 29, a Boston-area lawyer who rented the coat in January. "It kind of only works once," she said.
"You go to an event with the pasta coat, and you talk about the pasta coat. It is not going to be as impressive the second time you see it."
But the effect the coat seems to have on people is undeniable.
Sarah Katz-Hyman, 33, who works for a nonprofit in San Francisco and rented the coat last spring on Nuuly, said it made her more extroverted. "It is nice to be able to put on a piece of clothing and Sasha Fierce it," she said.
She missed the coat so much after she returned it that she posted on Twitter a video montage of herself wearing it, set to the plaintive Sarah McLachlan song "Angel." Someone at Nuuly saw the tweet, and sent her a free coat.
"People were giddy when they saw me wearing it," said Hannah Tate, 29, who works at a health-products company in Chicago. She rented the coat last December, and again in January.
Katey Ghobrial, who works in marketing at Yelp in New York, said a server at the Greenwich Village restaurant Minetta Tavern sat down at her table to discuss the pasta puffer when she wore it to dinner recently.
"I feel like a total celebrity," said Ms. Ghobrial, 32.
But many pasta puffer enthusiasts also acknowledged the jacket's downsides: It's not very warm. It's boxy. It's expensive.
Alex Bruza, 31, an advertising employee in Los Angeles, rented the coat in December 2022, and said it was "not that flattering," as it "jutted out on the bottom, and it made me look a little bigger."
But with a coat like this, it's not really about the fit. It's about the joy.
"I was still obsessed with it," she said.

Invasion of the Celestial Photobombers: [Science Desk]

Full text: Scientists found that an increasing number of pictures made by the iconic orbital observatory are being disrupted by passing satellites.
The Hubble Space Telescope, known for recording awe-inspiring images of the cosmos while advancing the field of astronomy, is under threat.
Private companies are launching thousands of satellites that are photobombing the telescope -- producing long bright streaks and curves of light that can be impossible to remove. And the problem is only getting worse.
A study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, reveals an increase in the percentage of images recorded by the Hubble that are spoiled by passing satellites. And the data goes only through 2021. Thousands more satellites have been launched since then by SpaceX and other companies, and many more are expected to go to orbit in the years ahead, affecting the Hubble and potentially other telescopes in space.
"We're going to be living with this problem. And astronomy will be impacted," said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the study. "There will be science that can't be done. There will be science that's significantly more expensive to do. There will be things that we miss."
The Hubble Space Telescope's legacy cannot be overstated. Because of the observatory, we now know, for example, that the universe is 13.8 billion years old, that most galaxies contain a supermassive black hole at their centers and that stars form in violent processes. The Hubble's images -- including the gorgeous clouds of gas and dust in the "pillars of creation" and the view of nearly 10,000 galaxies in the "Hubble ultra deep field" -- never fail to inspire.
But the number of satellites in orbit has significantly increased since the Hubble launched in 1990, and now it is staring at the cosmos through a field of satellites.
In May 2019, SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlink satellites, designed to broadcast internet signals across the globe. Soon after, an outcry emerged among astronomers who were concerned that Starlink's streaks would jeopardize a number of campaigns to observe the universe from telescopes on Earth.
In response, Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, suggested that astronomers bypass the issue by moving telescopes to orbit.
But Hubble, which lives in low-Earth orbit roughly 335 miles above Earth's surface, actually resides less than 10 miles below most Starlink satellites. That means that the observatory and other orbital space telescopes are still facing interference from satellite constellations. "Not only do you have to put your telescopes in space, but you also have to put them above all the other traffic," Dr. McDowell said.
"I think we'll be forced to do that in the decades to come," he said. But that isn't possible for current telescopes in low-Earth orbit or spacecraft that governments are building and launching in the coming years.
To quantify the effect of satellite constellations on Hubble, Sandor Kruk, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and his colleagues analyzed an archive of images taken from 2002 through 2021.
They had help from hundreds of citizen scientists who pored through images to tag those with clear satellite streaks. That dataset was then used as a training set for a machine-learning algorithm that analyzed more than 100,000 individual Hubble photos. Their results show that the chance of seeing a satellite in a Hubble image from 2009 to 2020 is only 3.7 percent. But the chance of seeing one in 2021 is 5.9 percent -- an increase that they say corresponds to Starlink. By the date of the analysis, 1,562 Starlink satellites were in orbit. Another company, OneWeb, had lofted 320 satellites.
Mark McCaughrean, an astronomer at the European Space Agency and a co-author on the new study, is confident in their analysis, but notes that this is only a minor issue at the moment. Typically, Hubble takes multiple images that are stacked on top of one another -- a technique that will erase any satellites.
And NASA agrees. "While such analyses may show a gradual increase in detected satellite trails over time, most of these streaks are readily removed using standard data reduction techniques, and the majority of affected images are still usable," a spokeswoman said in regard to the latest study. "Satellite streaks do not currently pose a significant threat to Hubble's science efficiency and data analysis."
That threat is higher when the Hubble surveys a large swath of the sky. Then it might take only one or two images before redirecting its camera. If a satellite photobombs one of those images, the image might have to be tossed.
In addition, the satellites could pose a serious threat to a telescope that hasn't launched yet. At the end of this year, China plans to send Xuntian, also known as the Chinese Survey Space Telescope, into low-Earth orbit. Xuntian will have a larger field of view than Hubble, making it much harder for satellites to slip by undetected.
"It's going to be very severely affected by these satellites right off the bat," Dr. McDowell said.
And Xuntian can't simply launch into a higher orbit. China's plan is for the telescope to share an orbit with the Tiangong space station so that astronauts can refurbish it if necessary.
A spokesman from SpaceX declined to comment on the new study, but pointed toward the company's past efforts to mitigate the effects of Starlink. The company has tried a variety of methods to darken its satellites, including a mirror film designed to direct light away from the ground. But Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist at Queen's University Belfast who was not involved in the study, worries that the light will be directed up instead and could potentially worsen the situation for space-based telescopes.
There are simply too many unknowns at the moment, including the ultimate number of satellites.
SpaceX hopes to eventually expand the size of its fleet to 42,000 Starlink satellites. Many other companies are in the market, too: Amazon, the British satellite provider OneWeb, a Chinese company called Galaxy Space, and even governments. A combined 431,713 satellites are planned to launch in the coming years.
"It's a bit of a feeding frenzy at the moment," Dr. McCaughrean said.
That estimate is based on filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the International Telecommunication Union. But even if only 100,000 satellites launched, that would increase the number of satellites in orbit by a factor of 10 since the new study took place -- meaning that roughly 50 percent of Hubble's images would spot a satellite. And if every other image had a satellite streak, the researchers worry about how much usable science could be gathered.
"When will Hubble not be useful anymore?" Dr. McCaughrean asked. "That might be 10 or 20 years away, but it's not inconceivable that there's a point at which you say, 'Let's not bother anymore."'

Full text: The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in a suit that the oil and gas company failed to remedy years of racial harassment faced by Black workers.
The federal government filed an employment discrimination lawsuit in Louisiana on Thursday against Exxon Mobil after investigating a Black employee's complaint that nooses had been found at a Baton Rouge, La., refinery complex.
The lawsuit said that the company created a hostile work environment for the employee, Milferd McGhee, and other workers by failing to implement measures to remedy and prevent harassment after five nooses were found at the complex between April 2016 and December 2020.
Mr. McGhee filed a complaint against Exxon with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces civil rights laws against workplace discrimination.
He reported the discovery of a noose to a supervisor in January 2020, and nearly a year later, another noose appeared, according to the lawsuit. The first case was in April 2016, when an employee at the Baton Rouge plant reported that a rope had been tied into a noose hanging from a scaffold.
The company investigated and banned two unidentified contractors but did not take remedial measures, "such as training, counseling or policy changes, to prevent further racial harassment," the lawsuit said.
In subsequent incidents, including the noose that Mr. McGhee reported at his work site in January 2020, the company investigated but failed to identify a perpetrator or implement measures to remedy racial harassment at the workplace, the suit said.
The government is seeking damages for Mr. McGhee's "emotional pain and suffering, inconvenience and humiliation," the suit said.
"A noose is a longstanding symbol of violence associated with the lynching of African Americans," Elizabeth Owen, an E.E.O.C. lawyer in New Orleans, said in a statement. "Such symbols are inherently threatening and significantly alter the workplace environment for Black Americans."
In response to the suit, which was filed in United States District Court in Baton Rouge, Exxon said in a statement that it disagreed "with the E.E.O.C.'s findings and allegations."
"We encourage employees to report claims like this, and we thoroughly investigated," the statement said. "The symbols of hate are unacceptable, offensive and in violation of our corporate policies. We have a zero-tolerance policy of any form of harassment or discrimination in the workplace by or toward employees, contractors, suppliers or customers."
The commission said that it had sought but failed to reach a conciliation agreement with Exxon in February before it filed the suit.
The noose, a potent expression of racial animus, has appeared at work sites, schools and other public settings in recent years.
Amazon paused construction of a fulfillment center in Windsor, Conn., in May 2021 after seven nooses appeared at the work site. The status of a police investigation that involved the F.B.I. was not clear on Sunday.
The F.B.I. also helped in an investigation in 2017 after bananas in nooses were found on the campus of American University in Washington on the first full day Taylor Dumpson, the first Black woman to be elected student body president, was in office.

NEW YORK — A24, an independent film and television studio barreling into next weekend’s Academy Awards with a boatload of Oscar nominations, is making an unexpected move into live performance, purchasing a small off-Broadway theater in New York’s West Village.
The studio, which until now has focused on making movies, television shows and podcasts, has purchased the Cherry Lane Theater for $10 million and plans to present plays as well as other forms of live entertainment there, in addition to the occasional film screening.
A24, whose films include leading Oscar contender “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” is not the first film studio to make such a move: The Walt Disney Co. has been presenting stage productions at Broadway’s New Amsterdam Theater, which it leases from the state and city, since 1997. But Disney, of course, is an entertainment industry behemoth that has mastered the art of multiplatform storytelling.
A more comparable move, perhaps, was that by Audible, an Amazon audio subsidiary that since 2018 has been leasing Minetta Lane Theater, in Greenwich Village, for live productions that it then records and offers on its digital platform. And Netflix, the streaming juggernaut, has in recent years taken over several cinemas, including the Paris Theater in New York, as well as the Egyptian and Bay theaters in Los Angeles.
The A24 acquisition, coming at time when many theaters are still struggling to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, suggests a vote of confidence in live performance. A24 plans to present some events celebrating Cherry Lane’s centennial this spring, and then to close the theater for renovations before beginning full-scale programming next year.
Much remains uncertain about how the company intends to use the theater. A24 declined to make anyone available to speak on the record about the acquisition, but an official there said the company had not yet decided whether it would develop work for the stage or present work developed by others. The official, who was granted anonymity to describe the company’s plans, said the studio hoped the theater would allow it to strengthen existing relationships with writers and performers who work on stage and screen, and to develop new relationships with comedians and theater artists.
A24 plans to retain the theater’s existing staff while adding to it with its own team, the official said, and as part of the renovation, it plans to install technology so the theater can be used for film screenings.
The official said A24’s theater venture is a partnership with Taurus Investment Holdings.
“I really believe my theater is going into the right hands,” said Angelina Fiordellisi, who has owned the theater since 1996. “They love to develop and produce the work of emerging writers, and a lot of their writers are playwrights. I can’t imagine a better way to bring future life to the theater.”
Fiordellisi, 68, has been trying to sell the theater for some time.
“I don’t want to work that hard anymore,” she said, “and I want to spend more time with my family.”
The purchase, previously reported by Curbed, includes three attached properties: a 179-seat theater, a 60-seat theater and eight apartments, on the Village’s picturesque, curving Commerce Street. The Cherry Lane, in a 19th-century building that was a brewery and a box factory before being converted to theatrical use in 1923, bills itself as the city’s longest continually running off-Broadway theater.
In 2021, Fiordellisi agreed to sell the property to the Lucille Lortel Theater for $11 million, but the sale fell apart. Last week, Lortel announced it had spent $5.3 million to purchase a three-story carriage house in Chelsea, where it plans to open a 61-seat theater in 2025. The Lortel organization also has a 295-seat theater in the West Village.
The Cherry Lane will now be a for-profit, commercial venture; Fiordellisi had operated it through a nonprofit, occasionally presenting work that she developed and more often renting it to nonprofit and commercial producers. Fiordellisi said she will convert her nonprofit to a foundation that will give grants to playwrights and small theater companies. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Gen Z Mystery: My Instagram Posts Keep Showing Up on Facebook!

More than a decade ago, Qu’ana Underwood, then a middle school student in Philadelphia, joined Facebook. But as other social media platforms appeared, Facebook “became an afterthought,” she said.
Then last March, after Underwood posted photos of herself at a university formal on Instagram, she was suddenly flooded with Facebook notifications from relatives and friends she doesn’t normally keep in touch with. Her Instagram post had also appeared on her Facebook profile, prompting her Facebook friends to like and comment on it.
Underwood said she was mystified by what was happening, especially when every post or story she shared on Instagram ended up on Facebook — even though she couldn’t remember the last time she had posted there.
“What is going on?” Underwood, a 22-year-old behavioral health specialist in Nashville, Tennessee, said she had asked herself.
Like Underwood, other teenagers and young adults have discovered in recent months that they’ve been unusually active on Facebook — even though they hadn’t opened the app. Some were shocked, they said, because they hadn’t used Facebook for years and were hearing from Facebook friends they had forgotten about, with no idea how to stop their Instagram posts from winding up on the older social network.
The surge in Facebook activity is rooted in a new feature from Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Last year, Meta introduced a prompt that popped up on Instagram when people posted a photo or story. The prompt asked Instagram users if they wanted to share their post to Facebook, too.
To make the prompt go away, users had to click a big blue button to agree to share their Instagram posts on Facebook, or a smaller hyperlink to opt out. Many people, including Underwood, clicked the more visible blue button — and then immediately forgot about it, according to interviews with more than a dozen Gen Z and millennial Instagram users. Reversing the setting requires clicking through multiple Instagram menus.
“It feels so sneaky,” said Ashley LaBossiere, 28, a digital media manager in Canton, Georgia, who has had trouble turning off the setting. “Is Facebook suffering so badly?”
Meta has long been concerned about losing teenagers and young adults to rivals like TikTok and Snapchat, especially since that audience is highly coveted by advertisers. Facebook, which Mark Zuckerberg created in 2004 while at Harvard University, was aimed at college students in its early years but has struggled in recent years with an aging user base.
Last year, 17% of Facebook users were 18 to 24 years old, compared with 44% who were older than 45, according to Data.ai, an analytics company. In contrast, 28% of Instagram users were 18 to 24 and 33% were older than 45, while 39% of Snapchat users and 30% of TikTok users were 18 to 24.
To appeal to younger users, Instagram and Facebook have in recent years introduced features like Stories, which emulates a Snapchat feature by letting people post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. They also rolled out Reels, a TikTok-like feature that lets people create short videos.
Last year, Instagram engineers were told that Meta wanted more people to post from Instagram to Facebook, said three people involved with the project, who were not authorized to speak publicly. That led to the new prompt, which was designed so most users would give Instagram permission to permanently share their posts with Facebook, they said. The prompt was placed where thumbs typically fall on a screen, one of the people said.
Meta declined to comment on what had led to the prompt and its design. But the company said not all Instagram users received the prompt and acknowledged that some had to decline multiple times before Instagram stopped asking. Meta also said a software bug last year caused some users to see the prompt every time they posted on Instagram.
“We know that people enjoy cross-posting content to easily share with their friends and followers across our apps,” a spokesperson for Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Messenger, said in a statement.
Tech companies have long encouraged users to stay on their services by tweaking their products, said Tony Hu, who teaches product design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One example are the pop-up windows that people click once to accept all internet cookies, which collect their data and track them online, he said. Another is how Amazon made it easy to buy items with just one click, he said.
Referring to Meta’s prompt, Hu said, “Maybe they are just nudging people to share because that drives their viewership, ad revenue.”
For some teenagers and young adults, unintentionally posting on Facebook from Instagram has resulted in mild embarrassment and mad dashes to undo the sharing.
In January, said LaBossiere, the digital media manager, she rushed to delete a post about narcissistic mothers that she had shared on Instagram and had ended up on her Facebook profile, because she didn’t want her mother’s friends to see it.
LaBossiere considers herself tech savvy but has lost count of the times she has declined to share from Instagram to Facebook, only to accidentally do so again, she said.
“Maybe I don’t know what I’m doing,” she said. “That’s when I start feeling like I’m 100 years old.”
Mia Bramel, 23, a software engineer in Santa Clara, California, said she had deliberately kept her Instagram and Facebook accounts separate — only for the prompt to upend that. On Instagram, she said, she typically shares photos of nature and videos of herself practicing piano pieces. On Facebook, which she uses less frequently, she shares life updates like graduating from college.
“I always feel very aware of who is viewing anything,” she said. “I feel like the things that I post on Instagram are only really meant for the people who follow me. If it were on Facebook, it would feel really weird.”
But now a selfie or an “artistic and experimental” Instagram post sometimes winds up on Facebook. That makes it feel harder to “control” her social media presence, Bramel said.
Others have embraced the sharing of Instagram posts on Facebook. Loren Cantor, 22, a student and musician in Montreal, said the new setting had been a “pleasant surprise” because it helped him keep in touch with family.
In 2011, Cantor joined Facebook, where his most active friends are his family. He joined Instagram in 2013, and his followers there are friends from school and from making music. When he started accidentally cross-posting, he said, he started hearing more from his grandmother and aunt.
“Facebook is a more family-oriented thing for the older generations who aren’t on these other apps,” he said. “I really don’t know what’s going on on Facebook.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Why Are Conductors Upset About 'Tár'?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Academy Awards are still a week away, but at least one verdict is in: "Tár" is a hit, having already won some 60 international awards and six Oscar nominations, including for best picture, best directing and best actress in a leading role. It has also engendered passionate conversations, articles and interpretations.
The film, written and directed by Todd Field, stars Cate Blanchett as the fiercely ambitious conductor Lydia Tár. Throughout the film we are never sure what is "real" and what is imagined. She is constantly sanitizing her hands and popping pills and frequently walking in her sleep. Like Lady Macbeth, she is a work of fiction.
But some of my fellow conductors, as well as a few music critics, aren't so happy. Some of their objections are aesthetic, some refer to errors of jargon, like calling Mahler's Fifth Symphony "the Mahler Five." One conductor in particular is more personal: "I was offended as a woman," wrote Marin Alsop, "I was offended as a conductor, I was offended as a lesbian."
Not too many years ago, the funny and freewheeling Amazon Prime series "Mozart in the Jungle," which ran for four seasons, depicted classical musicians engaging in a whole range of morally questionable behaviors. No one in the classical music community, as far as I can find, complained or took any of it too seriously. Real classical music stars such as Lang Lang, Alan Gilbert and Joshua Bell appeared in the series alongside the cast of actors. Even Gustavo Dudamel -- now the incoming music director of the New York Philharmonic -- showed his good sense of humor by making a cameo appearance as a stage manager. By the final season, the fictional musician Hailey Rutledge, played by the actress Lola Kirke, had become a conductor (Episode 2: "Hailey continues to lie about her current career path.") So if a thoroughly irreverent show like that didn't raise a false upbeat, what's the uproar over "Tár" really about?
Many of the complaints within the classical music community seem to grow out of a concern that if you write a fictional drama depicting unsavory characters (Lydia is accused of abusing a young female student -- though that is never proved in the film), the segment of the moviegoing public who don't generally attend classical concerts will be driven even further away.
But audiences are smarter than that. "Tár" was released on Oct. 7, 2022. That month streams of Mahler's Symphony No. 5 -- a work that looms large in the film as one Lydia has yet to record with a major orchestra -- were up 150 percent from the previous month, according to data provided by Apple. Compared with the previous October, that number had more than tripled. Streaming of Mahler's Fifth also jumped on Spotify after the release of the film. The "Tár" concept album on Deutsche Grammophon hit No. 1 on the Billboard classical charts. And you can count on it: When my friend Marin Alsop next conducts Mahler's Fifth, the press will celebrate what surely will be a brilliant performance -- and also refer to "Tár."
Historically, movies about badly behaving classical musicians were met with about the same suspension of disbelief as were noir mysteries and mobster movies. (Some movies portrayed the maestro as a savior. See "A Hundred Men and a Girl" from 1937.) In 1946, Warner Bros. released "Deception," about a fictional composer-conductor, played by Claude Rains, who leads the not-mentioned New York Philharmonic. He is a predator and a sadistic genius, and the concert pianist who is also his much younger lover, played by Bette Davis, shoots and kills him. That year also saw the release of "Humoresque," about a young violinist and an older patroness and lover, played by Joan Crawford, who ultimately commits suicide. Around the same time, moviegoers were treated to the thriller "Hangover Square," which begins with a classical composer stabbing a shop owner to death and setting his establishment on fire.
Fiction or not, the sort of backstage backstabbing depicted in "Tár" is, alas, very real. We conductors do not generally like our colleagues, and we delight in denigrating one another -- that is, until one of us dies. (I am now old enough for the younger set -- 50 and under -- to say nice things about me, which I find somewhat troubling.)
Yet there are surprising exceptions, Leonard Bernstein among them. In the 18 years I worked with him, the closest I heard him engaging in what the Germans call a dirigentenkrieg -- a conductors' war -- was to say of his archrival, Herbert von Karajan, "I don't think Herbert has ever read a book." More typical was Arturo Toscanini, who called Leopold Stokowski "il Pagliaccio" (the clown) for appearing in Disney's "Fantasia" and shaking Mickey Mouse's hand.
There are many reasons for this. Conductors are competitors. But judging how "good" we are is complicated because we live in a world of opinions, not score cards. Critics respond to the ephemera of our performances with indelible printed words, and far more people read those words than attend our performances. We appear to be all-knowing, grandly wielding a stick and controlling the greatest expressions of humanity, but we are truly in charge only when we are permitted to be in charge.
Our leadership, in reality, is about relationships -- a kind of alternating current between the players and ourselves, as well as between the sounds we are making and our audience. When we see Lydia before the orchestra, she is charming, friendly and demanding. We strive so passionately to succeed -- to at least be competent -- because the job is inherently impossible. "No one knows how bad you are better than yourself" was a brilliant thing Michael Tilson Thomas said to me in 1971. There is no field that has more variations in technique, ability and training than conducting. That is its art and alchemy. We are easy to lionize and easy to denigrate.
Glamour and power were never the point when conducting was developed in the 19th century. Robert Schumann thought we should conduct only when the tempo changed, and otherwise just stand quietly and wait. Verdi, who saw it all -- from his early operas, which were led by a violinist seated in front of the stage, to the imperious Toscanini commanding his "Falstaff" from an orchestra pit -- said in a letter, "And now conductors actually take a bow, if you can believe it!"
Not all conductors, it should be said, have come out against "Tár," and especially not all women conductors. After all, the film features a female maestro leading one of the most prestigious orchestras in the world, with a female concertmaster and a female soloist playing the fiendishly difficult Elgar Cello concerto (notably, the piece was played this past week by Yo-Yo Ma, with Daniela Candillari leading the New York Philharmonic; during the past two months, the Philharmonic has been led by Ruth Reinhardt, Nathalie Stutzmann, Lidiya Yankovskaya and Dalia Stasevska). One of the most arresting scenes revolves around a composition by a woman, Anna Thorvaldsdottir. The person who wrote the accompanying music to the film, Hildur Gudnadottir, is a woman. Natalie Murray Beale, who has conducted operas at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, trained Ms. Blanchett. Other successful women conductors have supported the film, including Alice Farnham and Simone Young.
If W.H. Auden saw the last century as the Age of Anxiety, we might consider that we are living in the Age of Grievance. We want every story to tell every story, making storytelling all but impossible. But when metaphor is mistaken for reality, creativity, imagination and joy are extinguished.
So, let's all take a deep breath. Or at least just take our cue from Gustavo. (The Times's Joshua Barone called "Tár" "the comedy of the year." "The less seriously you take this movie," he said, "the better.") "Tár" is not actually about any of us. Lydia is a fiction -- made real by the performance of a great actress. We are all -- composers, conductors, musicians and audience -- merely human. The lie some of us cling to, that the artistic greatness that pours through us makes us great, is the truth at the heart of "Tár."

Argentina's Irresistible Everyman: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: When the country has a nominated film, it has usually starred this veteran. But the actor says other people have believed in his talent more than he has.
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Fortune has long favored Ricardo Darín. More than the subjective concept of talent, it is providence, manifested as other people's unwavering confidence in his abilities, that the actor credits for his storied career as Argentina's most celebrated film star internationally.
"I've had all the luck that my parents didn't have as actors," he said in Spanish during a recent interview at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood. "Many times, people have valued me far more than I value myself, and I often think, 'Do I deserve all that?"'
The latest example of his relationship with Lady Luck is his turn as the real-life prosecutor Julio Strassera in "Argentina, 1985," a historical courtroom drama about the Trial of the Juntas, when military leaders were tried for human rights violations during the former dictatorship. Directed by Santiago Mitre, it earned Argentina an Oscar nomination for best international feature film.
Darín seems to be his country's lucky charm when it comes to the Academy Awards. He has starred in all four movies to earn Argentina a nod this century, including "Son of the Bride," "Wild Tales" and "The Secret in Their Eyes," which took home the statuette in 2010. And Argentina has also submitted several other Darín-led productions to the academy over the years -- meaning that even though they didn't all make the cut, the films in which he appears are almost synonymous with the best of Argentine cinema.
From the first handshake, Darín, 66, radiates a welcoming aura. Casually dressed in bluejeans and a navy sweater, he speaks with a warmth and candor that most people reserve for their closest friends. That temperament translates onscreen.
"Ricardo has an immense power to elicit empathy from the audience, and that's rare," said the director Juan José Campanella, who has collaborated with Darín on four features.
Though the actor inherited a passion for performance from his parents, who were both working actors in Buenos Aires, neither was enthusiastic about his carrying on the family's craft. "They didn't fight me on it, but they also didn't encourage me to do it," he recalled.
Darín thinks of his path as preordained. He was a regular on film and TV sets and theater stages in childhood, first acting professionally at 3 years old in the 1960 series "Soledad Monsalvo." At 10 he debuted onstage alongside his parents. By the time he attended his first theater workshop at 14, Darín felt like a seasoned veteran who had already experienced many facets of the job firsthand.
For a time in adolescence, he contemplated becoming a veterinarian, a psychologist or even a lawyer. But in the end, the world he had always been familiar with persuaded him to stay. Doors opened easily for him, with frequent invitations to participate in a variety of projects.
That trust from notable people in the industry is what he calls fortune. Darín has dear memories of the television director Diana Álvarez, who got into a fight with a network in 1982 so that he could be part of the show "Nosotros y Los Miedos." She saw in him potential that others couldn't.
"In our profession, luck is very important," Darín said. "There are very talented people out there with lots to tell who can't find opportunities."
In the 1990s, Darín found immense success as the co-star of the sitcom "Mi Cuñado" ("My Brother-in-Law"), playing an impertinent but charming screw-up. His contract restricted him from other TV ventures but allowed him to pursue films. Among them was his first outing with Campanella, "The Same Love, the Same Rain" (1999), which helped other directors see beyond his TV persona.
One of them, Fabián Bielinsky, cast him in the thriller "Nine Queens" (released in Argentina in 2000) as a sleazy con man. "He told me, 'I hadn't thought about you for this role. You are too charismatic, and I don't want the audience to have any empathy for him,"' Darín recalled.
In Campanella's view, "There's only one thing Ricardo cannot be, and that is unlikable. The clearest proof is 'Nine Queens,' where he plays an amoral crook, but we still root for him."
Campanella's heartfelt "Son of the Bride" arrived the next year and mined Darín's comic sensibilities for the role of a restaurant owner dealing with his aging parents.
"Once an Argentine critic called him 'our Henry Fonda' because he projects great integrity," Campanella said. "But he has something that Fonda didn't, which is a great sense of humor."
Darín maintains that it was the one-two punch of "Nine Queens" and "Son of the Bride" that cemented his film career.
"It was a great calling card for an actor to have the possibility of showing two absolutely opposite facets almost at once," Darín said. "Even though I was already well known for TV and theater, that's when I started to feel my colleagues were seeing me in a better light."
Since then, Darín has enjoyed his choice of roles, including Campanella's acclaimed "The Secret in Their Eyes," in which he starred as an investigator haunted by a gruesome, unresolved case.
Another of Darín's personal favorites is the dramedy "Truman" (2017), centered on a terminally ill man spending his final days alongside his best friends -- one human and one canine. His wry character reminded Darín of his late father, also named Ricardo Darín, whom he described as a peculiar Renaissance man with an acid sense of humor and wild ideas that others found difficult to digest.
Hollywood has reached out a handful of times, but he has declined, mostly because the most difficult thing for an actor to do is to think in another language, he said, adding that close-ups reveal when someone is reciting from memory rather than inhabiting an emotion.
"I've always trusted my gut, more than my heart or my head," Darín explained, then added, motioning to his stomach, "I trust in how the material hits me right here."
In Argentina, his turn in Damián Szifron's "Wild Tales" (released stateside in 2015) as a frustrated citizen who fights back against oppressive bureaucracy was widely embraced by audiences. "Ricardo has a lucid outlook on the realities that affect his country," Szifron said. "He is a popular figure while at the same time being a sophisticated actor."
For "Argentina, 1985," Mitre and Darín agreed not to mimic the voice or exact mannerisms of the real Strassera, but instead took a degree of artistic liberty in their re-creation.
Mitre, who had directed Darín as a fictional Argentine president in the 2017 political saga "The Summit," said he admired how the actor produces a truthful performance through a synthesis of his own sensibilities and the character's.
"It's as if the camera could capture him in his entirety, show him in all his complexity," Mitre said. "Whenever you see Ricardo act, you know there will be great honesty onscreen."
Beyond the positive critical reception of "Argentina, 1985" -- and its Golden Globe win -- Darín said the film's most significant effect was making a younger generation aware of a sorrowful chapter in the country's history.
"We can't forget that behind this reclaiming of the historical event that has brought us a lot of praise and happiness, there's a deeply painful story about the kind of suffering for which there is no balm," Darín noted with a solemn expression.
His family's acting tradition is being carried on by his son, Chino Darín, with whom he has formed a production company. The two starred in and produced the 2019 comedy "Heroic Losers." The elder Darín never opposed his child's interest in the craft, only advising him to follow the path that would bring the most satisfaction.
"I'm one of those people who believe the most important thing in life is to try to be happy," Darín said. "The closer you are to your vocation, the better chance you have at being happy."

A.I. Regulation Can Be Puzzle To Lawmakers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tech innovations are again racing ahead of Washington's ability to regulate them, lawmakers and A.I. experts said.
In recent weeks, two members of Congress have sounded the alarm over the dangers of artificial intelligence.
Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in January that he was "freaked out" by the ability of the ChatGPT chatbot to mimic human writers. Another Democrat, Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, gave a one-minute speech -- written by a chatbot -- calling for regulation of A.I.
But even as lawmakers put a spotlight on the technology, few are taking action on it. No bill has been proposed to protect individuals or thwart the development of A.I.'s potentially dangerous aspects. And legislation introduced in recent years to curb A.I. applications like facial recognition have withered in Congress.
The problem is that most lawmakers do not even know what A.I. is, said Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican and the only member of Congress with a master's degree in artificial intelligence.
"Before regulation, there needs to be agreement on what the dangers are, and that requires a deep understanding of what A.I. is," he said. "You'd be surprised how much time I spend explaining to my colleagues that the chief dangers of A.I. will not come from evil robots with red lasers coming out of their eyes."
The inaction over A.I. is part of a familiar pattern, in which technology is again outstripping U.S. rule-making and regulation. Lawmakers have long struggled to understand new innovations, once describing the internet as a "series of tubes." For just as long, companies have worked to slow down regulations, saying the industry needs few roadblocks as the United States competes with China for tech leadership.
That means Washington is taking a hands-off stance as an A.I. boom has gripped Silicon Valley, with Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta racing one another to develop the technology. The spread of A.I., which has spawned chatbots that can write poetry and cars that drive themselves, has provoked a debate over its limits, with some fearing that the technology can eventually replace humans in jobs or even become sentient.
Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, a London organization focused on the responsible use of technology, said a lack of regulation encouraged companies to put a priority on financial and commercial interests at the expense of safety.
"By failing to establish such guardrails, policymakers are creating the conditions for a race to the bottom in irresponsible A.I.," she said.
In the regulatory vacuum, the European Union has taken a leadership role. In 2021, E.U. policymakers proposed a law focused on regulating the A.I. technologies that might create the most harm, such as facial recognition and applications linked to critical public infrastructure like the water supply. The measure, which is expected to be passed as soon as this year, would require makers of A.I. to conduct risk assessments of how their applications could affect health, safety and individual rights, like freedom of expression.
Companies that violated the law could be fined up to 6 percent of their global revenue, which could total billions of dollars for the world's largest tech platforms. E.U. policymakers said the law was needed to maximize artificial intelligence's benefits while minimizing its societal risks.
"We're at the beginning of understanding this technology and weighing its great benefits and potential dangers," said Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, who recently began taking evening college classes on A.I.
Mr. Beyer said U.S. lawmakers would examine the European bill for ideas on regulation and added, "This will take time."
In fact, the federal government has been deeply involved in A.I. for more than six decades. In the 1960s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, began funding research and development of the technology. The support helped lead to military applications like drones and cybersecurity tools.
Criticism of A.I. was largely muted in Washington until January 2015 when the physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and now the owner of Twitter, warned that A.I. was becoming dangerously intelligent and could lead to the end of the human race. They called for regulations.
In November 2016, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness held the first congressional hearing on A.I., with Mr. Musk's warnings cited twice by lawmakers. During the hearing, academics and the chief executive of OpenAI, a San Francisco lab, batted down Mr. Musk's predictions or said they were at least many years away.
Some lawmakers stressed the importance of the nation's leadership in A.I. development. Congress must "ensure that the United States remains a global leader throughout the 21st century," Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and chair of the subcommittee, said at the time.
DARPA subsequently announced that it was earmarking $ 2 billion for A.I. research projects.
Warnings about A.I.'s dangers intensified in 2021 as the Vatican, IBM and Microsoft pledged to develop "ethical A.I.," which means organizations are transparent about how the technology works, respect privacy and minimize biases. The group called for regulation of facial recognition software, which uses large databases of photos to pinpoint people's identity. In Washington, some lawmakers tried creating rules for facial recognition technology and for company audits to prevent discriminatory algorithms. The bills went nowhere.
"It's not a priority and doesn't feel urgent for members," said Mr. Beyer, who failed to get enough support last year to pass a bill on audits of A.I. algorithms, sponsored with Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York.
More recently, some government officials have tried bridging the knowledge gap around A.I. In January, about 150 lawmakers and their staffs packed a meeting, hosted by the usually sleepy A.I. Caucus, that featured Jack Clark, a founder of the A.I. company Anthropic.

Some action around A.I. is taking place in federal agencies, which are enforcing laws already on the books. The Federal Trade Commission has brought enforcement orders against companies that used A.I. in violation of its consumer protection rules. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also warned that opaque A.I. systems used by credit agencies could run afoul of anti-discrimination laws.
The F.T.C. has also proposed commercial surveillance regulations to curb the collection of data used in A.I. technology, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a list of A.I. technology in medical devices that come under its purview.
In October, the White House issued a blueprint for rules on A.I., stressing the rights of individuals to privacy and safe automated systems, protection from algorithmic discrimination and meaningful human alternatives.
But none of the efforts have amounted to laws.
"The picture in Congress is bleak," said Amba Kak, the executive director of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit research center, who recently advised the F.T.C. "The stakes are high because these tools are used in very sensitive social domains like in hiring, housing and credit, and there is real evidence that over the years, A.I. tools have been flawed and biased."
Tech companies have lobbied against policies that would limit how they used A.I. and have called for mostly voluntary regulations.
In 2020, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, the parent of Google, visited Brussels to argue for "sensible regulation" that would not hold back the technology's potential benefits. That same year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and more than 30 companies, including Amazon and Meta, lobbied against facial recognition bills, according to OpenSecrets.org.
"We aren't anti-regulation, but we'd want smart regulation," said Jordan Crenshaw, a vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, which has argued that the draft E.U. law is overly broad and could hamper tech development.
In January, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, visited several members of Congress to demonstrate GPT-4, a new A.I. model that can write essays, solve complex coding problems and more, according to Mr. Beyer and Mr. Lieu. Mr. Altman, who has said he supports regulation, showed how GPT-4 will have greater security controls than previous A.I. models, the lawmakers said.
Mr. Lieu, who met with Mr. Altman, said the government couldn't rely on individual companies to protect users. He plans to introduce a bill this year for a commission to study A.I. and for a new agency to regulate it.
"OpenAI decided to put controls into its technology, but what is to guarantee another company will do the same?" he asked.

2-Year Mining Strike Ends Without a Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The strike at the Warrior Met Coal mine was one of the longest in U.S. history, but the price of coal soared during the walkout, giving the company leverage.
Hundreds of coal miners in Alabama have been told by their union that they can start returning to work before a contract deal has been reached, bringing an unceremonious end to one of the longest mining strikes in U.S. history.
The move by the United Mine Workers of America to conclude its nearly two-year work stoppage is a blow to the union, a storied and powerful labor organization, which has been pushing for higher pay and improved working conditions at the Warrior Met Coal mine, near Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Negotiating sessions became more infrequent in recent months, and "it didn't seem like the strike was going in the direction it needed to be," said Larry Spencer, a vice president of the United Mine Workers of America, who helped lead the Alabama strike.
He added: "We didn't get the exact outcome we wanted. But it showed people there is a lot of solidarity here and these guys have stuck together, and that is a positive thing."
Roughly 900 miners went out on strike on April 1, 2021, and most were able to start the process of returning to the mine this week. Some unionized workers had crossed the picket line and returned to work already, while others took jobs at other companies, including an Amazon warehouse less than 30 miles away that was the site of a failed union drive last year.
The Amazon union drive drew a flurry of national attention, with even President Biden weighing in at one point. But the miners' strike, which received much less notice, was seen as a show of old-line labor solidarity amid new organizing efforts across modern industries like tech.
The strike was heated, with both sides accusing the other of violence and vandalism. The miners were also upset that, after they accepted pay cuts when the company emerged from a 2015 bankruptcy, their previous wages had not been restored to match what other mines paid. Warrior Met said on its website during the strike that it had never promised it would do so, and that it had given workers multiple raises in recent years.
In a statement, a spokesman for Warrior Met said the company was working to ensure "a seamless return to work for our striking miners." He added that "we strongly believe that partnering with the U.M.W.A. is critical to achieving our shared goal of maintaining a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship."
Labor unions across the world voiced support for the miners, but the group failed to muster broad political support. Coal mining in the deeply red state of Alabama was not a popular cause for many prominent Democrats, who are trying to encourage less carbon-intensive industries. Most national Republicans, despite promises by former President Donald J. Trump to save the coal industry, did not publicly back the Alabama strike.
Probably the biggest factor undermining the strike was the price of coal, which soared over the course of the walkout. The Warrior Met mine produces metallurgical coal, which is used in steel-making and is in high demand.
Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, said the company was able to profitably operate the mine with relatively few nonunion replacement workers because of high coal prices.
Mr. Roberts said he expected coal prices to stay high for the foreseeable future, which could have forced the strike to drag on for several more years.
In 2022, the strike's first full year, Warrior Met's profits rose to $ 641 million from $ 150 million in 2021; its stock price soared 143 percent during the 23-month strike.
Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America and chairman of Our Revolution, an advocacy group started by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said the protracted strike showed how companies had the upper hand because they could bring in replacement workers.
The striking miners were an eclectic group, a mix of Trump supporters and Biden voters. Some were Black residents of Birmingham, Ala., and others were white and from rural towns near the mine. During the work stoppage, they often supported one another through food donations.
"There is not a better union in the world in terms of solidarity," Mr. Cohen said. "If this can happen at Warrior Met, it can happen anywhere."
To attract the nonunion workers, Warrior Met has been paying large bonuses of $ 1,900 and annual salaries of $ 132,000. It's highly lucrative pay for blue-collar work in Alabama and something that would not have happened without the strike, Mr. Roberts said.
"Ironically, the replacement workers became some of the highest-paid coal miners in the country because of us," Mr. Roberts said, adding that he expects his union members to start receiving the same high pay when they return underground.
The union expects contract negotiations to resume in the coming weeks, after the process of returning the miners to work is complete.

To attract the nonunion workers, Warrior Met has been paying large bonuses of $1,900 and annual salaries of $132,000. It’s highly lucrative pay for blue-collar work in Alabama and something that would not have happened without the strike, Roberts said.
“Ironically, the replacement workers became some of the highest-paid coal miners in the country because of us,” Roberts said, adding that he expects his union members to start receiving the same high pay when they return underground.
The union expects contract negotiations to resume in the coming weeks, after the process of returning the miners to work is complete. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

WASHINGTON — In recent weeks, two members of Congress have sounded the alarm over the dangers of artificial intelligence.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in January that he was “freaked out” by the ability of the ChatGPT chatbot to mimic human writers. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., gave a one-minute speech — written by a chatbot — calling for regulation of AI.
But even as lawmakers put a spotlight on the technology, few are taking action on it. No bill has been proposed to protect individuals or thwart the development of AI’s potentially dangerous aspects. And legislation introduced in recent years to curb AI applications like facial recognition have withered in Congress.
The problem is that most lawmakers do not even know what AI is, said Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., the only member of Congress with a master’s degree in artificial intelligence.
“Before regulation, there needs to be agreement on what the dangers are, and that requires a deep understanding of what AI is,” he said. “You’d be surprised how much time I spend explaining to my colleagues that the chief dangers of AI will not come from evil robots with red lasers coming out of their eyes.”
The inaction over AI is part of a familiar pattern, in which technology is again outstripping U.S. rule-making and regulation. Lawmakers have long struggled to understand new innovations, once describing the internet as a “series of tubes.” For just as long, companies have worked to slow down regulations, saying the industry needs few roadblocks as the United States competes with China for tech leadership.
That means Washington is taking a hands-off stance as an AI boom has gripped Silicon Valley, with Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta racing one another to develop the technology. The spread of AI, which has spawned chatbots that can write poetry and cars that drive themselves, has provoked a debate over its limits, with some fearing that the technology can eventually replace humans in jobs or even become sentient.
Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, a London organization focused on the responsible use of technology, said a lack of regulation encouraged companies to put a priority on financial and commercial interests at the expense of safety.
“By failing to establish such guardrails, policymakers are creating the conditions for a race to the bottom in irresponsible AI,” she said.
In the regulatory vacuum, the European Union has taken a leadership role. In 2021, EU policymakers proposed a law focused on regulating the AI technologies that might create the most harm, such as facial recognition and applications linked to critical public infrastructure such as the water supply. The measure, which is expected to be passed as soon as this year, would require makers of AI to conduct risk assessments of how their applications could affect health, safety and individual rights, including freedom of expression.
Companies that violated the law could be fined up to 6% of their global revenue, which could total billions of dollars for the world’s largest tech platforms. EU policymakers said the law was needed to maximize artificial intelligence’s benefits while minimizing its societal risks.
“We’re at the beginning of understanding this technology and weighing its great benefits and potential dangers,” said Rep. Donald S. Beyer Jr., D-Va., who recently began taking evening college classes on AI.
Beyer said U.S. lawmakers would examine the European bill for ideas on regulation and added, “This will take time.”
In fact, the federal government has been deeply involved in AI for more than six decades. In the 1960s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, began funding research and development of the technology. The support helped lead to military applications, including drones and cybersecurity tools.
Criticism of AI was largely muted in Washington until January 2015 when physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and now the owner of Twitter, warned that AI was becoming dangerously intelligent and could lead to the end of the human race. They called for regulations.
In November 2016, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness held the first congressional hearing on AI, with Musk’s warnings cited twice by lawmakers. During the hearing, academics and the CEO of OpenAI, a San Francisco lab, batted down Musk’s predictions or said they were at least many years away.
Some lawmakers stressed the importance of the nation’s leadership in AI development. Congress must “ensure that the United States remains a global leader throughout the 21st century,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, chair of the subcommittee, said at the time.
DARPA subsequently announced that it was earmarking $2 billion for AI research projects.
Warnings about AI’s dangers intensified in 2021 as the Vatican, IBM and Microsoft pledged to develop “ethical AI,” which means organizations are transparent about how the technology works, respect privacy and minimize biases. The group called for regulation of facial recognition software, which uses large databases of photos to pinpoint people’s identity. In Washington, some lawmakers tried creating rules for facial recognition technology and for company audits to prevent discriminatory algorithms. The bills went nowhere.
“It’s not a priority and doesn’t feel urgent for members,” said Beyer, who failed to get enough support last year to pass a bill on audits of AI algorithms, sponsored with Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, D-N.Y.
More recently, some government officials have tried bridging the knowledge gap around AI In January, about 150 lawmakers and their staffs packed a meeting, hosted by the usually sleepy AI Caucus, that featured Jack Clark, a founder of the AI company Anthropic.
Some action around AI is taking place in federal agencies, which are enforcing laws already on the books. The Federal Trade Commission has brought enforcement orders against companies that used AI in violation of its consumer protection rules. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also warned that opaque AI systems used by credit agencies could run afoul of anti-discrimination laws.
The FTC has also proposed commercial surveillance regulations to curb the collection of data used in AI technology, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a list of AI technology in medical devices that come under its purview.
In October, the White House issued a blueprint for rules on AI, stressing the rights of individuals to privacy and safe automated systems, protection from algorithmic discrimination and meaningful human alternatives.
But none of the efforts have amounted to laws.
“The picture in Congress is bleak,” said Amba Kak, executive director of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit research center, who recently advised the FTC. “The stakes are high because these tools are used in very sensitive social domains like in hiring, housing and credit, and there is real evidence that over the years, AI tools have been flawed and biased.”
Tech companies have lobbied against policies that would limit how they used AI and have called for mostly voluntary regulations.
In 2020, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, the parent of Google, visited Brussels to argue for “sensible regulation” that would not hold back the technology’s potential benefits. That same year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and more than 30 companies, including Amazon and Meta, lobbied against facial recognition bills, according to OpenSecrets.org.
“We aren’t anti-regulation, but we’d want smart regulation,” said Jordan Crenshaw, a vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, which has argued that the draft EU law is overly broad and could hamper tech development.
In January, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, visited several members of Congress to demonstrate GPT-4, a new AI model that can write essays, solve complex coding problems and more, according to Beyer and Lieu. Altman, who has said he supports regulation, showed how GPT-4 will have greater security controls than previous AI models, the lawmakers said.
Lieu, who met with Altman, said the government couldn’t rely on individual companies to protect users. He plans to introduce a bill this year for a commission to study AI and for a new agency to regulate it.
“OpenAI decided to put controls into its technology, but what is to guarantee another company will do the same?” he asked. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Free Beer a Few Days a Week: Figuring Out the Hybrid Office: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hybrid work has been choose-your-own-adventure, but now C.E.O.s are making their choices more permanent.
The freight elevator doors opened onto 50,000 square feet of office real estate. Right now, it is empty, but Seth Besmertnik, chief executive of the software company Conductor, gestured at the beams and concrete floor with pride. He has plans for his company's new office -- conference rooms, a pickleball court and, of course, all of his 200 employees in the New York City area.
Mr. Besmertnik conceded that it was scary to persuade his board to sign a lease doubling his office real estate in 2021. But to him, leasing a larger office was a symbol of his belief in physical, in-person collaboration.
"As much as it might be nice to save the money, I want to save our soul first," he said, with the zeal that often inflects conversations about in-person work nearly three years into the pandemic. "I want to do the right thing for the company in the long term."
For many companies, though, signing the lease for an office is just the first step. Next, executives have to persuade their workers to fill it. Conductor has relied on both carrots ("Cold brew? Beer?" Mr. Besmertnik offered, jokingly, at 10:15 a.m.) and sticks (employees are required to come in three days a week). And like most other companies, it is still experimenting.
"I'm considering going to four days," Mr. Besmertnik said. "We definitely won't go to five. And might just stay at three."
Business leaders are in a phase of trial and error that comes with staggering stakes. They are figuring out how many days to call employees back to the office, and on top of that how strictly to enforce their own rules. While some companies are in five days a week and others have gone remote forever, many more employers have landed on a hybrid solution, and as they announce these plans they are facing fierce resistance. Amazon recently told its corporate workers to return to the office at least three days a week starting in May and faced an outcry on Slack, its employee messaging system, and Starbucks asked for three days from its 3,750 corporate employees, prompting an open letter of protest.
"I prefer to work from home," said Eric Deshawn Lerma, 26, an executive assistant at Amazon who is part of a more than 29,000-person Slack channel at the company called "Remote Advocacy." "To have that choice stripped from me based on purely speculative observations does not sit right with me."
Offices reached a crucial benchmark at the start of this year: They're at half their prepandemic occupancy. Just over half of workers who can do their jobs from home are now combining remote and in-person work, according to Gallup. A closer look at New York, from the Partnership for New York City, found that 82 percent of Manhattan office employers surveyed in late January were maintaining or adopting hybrid policies in 2023. So the corporate experts -- McKinsey, Mercer, PwC -- have consulted their crystal balls and declared: The future is hybrid.
Hybrid looks vastly different across every office. If the future is hybrid, to many executives that means the future is choose-your-own-adventure. But now the emphasis is shifting from adventure to choice. Executives are making return-to-office plans with more permanence, communicating requirements more clearly after months of hesitation and mushy expectations, though what their plans look like vary widely.
"There's not a Hybrid Office 101, where you can pick up the book and see what 100 offices have done before," said Richard Buery, chief executive of the Robin Hood Foundation, which requires employees to come in two days a week.
When Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, told employees to return to the office three days a week, he cited the need for more "face-to-face" and "serendipitous interactions." Previously, team directors each set remote work expectations. In response to the policy change, employees rebelled, drafting petitions and starting the "Remote Advocacy" Slack channel, where they argued that returning to the office would make child care more difficult, and exchanged concerns about their badge data being tracked. One Slack message, viewed by The New York Times, read: "I have not slept through the night since the announcement."
At Starbucks, which recently told corporate employees to come back to the office three days a week, more than 40 of them wrote an open letter in protest, saying: "Morale is at an all-time low, and the brand reputation and financial value of this publicly traded company are at risk."
At Conductor, which has required all employees within 90 minutes of an office to return three days a week, managers are ensuring that their teams adhere to the rules. Mr. Besmertnik believes that a lack of discipline, with hybrid work, leads to "self-fulfilling failure."
Orchard, a real estate company, gave its 500 employees an "open enrollment" period in which to decide whether they wanted to be remote or office workers. The 60 percent who selected the office are expected to come in two days a week.
The decisions that chief executives are making will have effects far beyond their own work spaces. Researchers estimate that office real estate values will plunge 39 percent from prepandemic levels in the coming years. Economists foretell a "doom loop" for urban commercial areas: With fewer people commuting to downtown neighborhoods, retail and services will suffer, prompting even fewer people to commute, spurring a drop in tax revenue that could further hurt downtown services such as public transportation.
Some companies have championed an office-free future -- especially Airbnb, which has benefited as ultra-remote workers move to far-flung cities.
"The cat's out of the bag," said Dave Stephenson, Airbnb's chief financial officer and head of employee experience. "For almost every C.F.O. that I've talked to who has had a policy of bringing people back to work, people are doing less than what they've been asked. If they've said they want to be back three days a week, they're getting them back two."
Fully remote work is simple enough to dictate, as is fully in person. Hybrid work often creates a conundrum. Employees say the primary motivation for them to commute into the office is the guarantee of seeing teammates. That demands coordination, with everybody coming in on the same day. But rigid policies often spark greater backlash.
"Well-organized hybrid is the best of all," said Nick Bloom, an economist and remote work expert at Stanford. "The problem is that organizing it requires managers to have discipline."
Wall Street's leaders have been clear that work arrangements are not up for popular debate. James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, whose employees are mostly in the office three or more days a week, said this year that remote work was "not an employee choice."
Other chief executives have been less firm. They understand that their workers save time and money by staying home, and they want to earn the commutes by making the office enticing.
At Orchard, the real estate company, that meant employees were greeted on a recent Wednesday with the rumble of a bar cart rolling past their desks, as the head of facilities played a Chumbawamba classic -- "I get knocked down, but I get up again" -- while offering beverages from an ice bucket filled with Six Point I.P.A.s, Modelos and sauvignon blanc. The bar cart had a photo of Jimmy Buffett with the caption, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere." In New York, it was 4:54.
Court Cunningham, the company's chief executive, declined to drink because he said he was heading to the gym, and couldn't combine burpees and beer. But he emphasized that rituals like happy hour ensured that the office was a space where employees wanted to spend their time, so managers didn't have to serve as hall monitors.
"It's hard to make it work, but when you do, it's magical," said Lorraine Buhannic, Orchard's chief people officer.
In Orchard's magic, there's some randomness: "We basically rolled the dice and said let's make it two days a week," Ms. Buhannic said, adding that the decision was also partly based on employee survey responses.
Business leaders realize, though, that their roll-the-dice decisions are shaping the way their employees approach work -- how people are generating ideas, and balancing lives and careers. And streams of research are emerging about the effects of remote work on both.
A study in Nature last year found that communicating virtually can inhibit creativity. Another study from researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that with the onset of remote work, the formation of what sociologists call "weak ties" -- measured in terms of emails between people with mutual contacts -- declined 38 percent. But then there's the immense stress relief that some workers have experienced with remote work. Parents have found that it enables them to better balance professional duties with child care. Employees of color say it reduces microaggressions and cliques.
The best hybrid arrangements promise to combine the values that all sides want: the creativity of in-person collaboration, the ease and fluidity of working from home. Some executives remain hopeful they can strike that balance.
Mr. Cunningham recalled the early years of his career, when his teammates at an investment bank were expected to be in the office until late at night. He recalled one colleague carrying in a cardboard box, telling the team that he had to mail something, then using the box to sneak out his jacket so he could finally go home. Those expectations of needless face time have now largely dissipated. (Maybe now that box could be used to sneak home extra beers.)
Back at Conductor, Mr. Besmertnik watched his office start to buzz as the head of internal communications, Dani Weiss, blasted music, grabbed a microphone and called everyone together for an all-staff meeting. Employees in New York, scattered around the open office, swiveled their chairs to face her, while screens beamed in the faces of workers in San Francisco, Berlin and Kyiv, Ukraine.
"When you're joining an all company meeting on Zoom, from home, it doesn't feel like this," Mr. Besmertnik said. "Right?"
"Come on, everybody!" Ms. Weiss shouted. "I don't see butts in those chairs."
Moments later, there they were.

Trying to Salve Wounds In Africa, France Vows To Change, and Listen: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: President Emmanuel Macron has embarked on a four-country visit as he slashes the French military presence and says colonial-era habits and attitudes must die.
President Emmanuel Macron of France has embarked on a quest to win favor across Africa on the basis of a policy of "profound humility," chastened by a decade-long frustrated military intervention and a wave of anti-French sentiment in France's former African colonies.
In practice, as he outlined in a speech this week, this reset will mean a much-reduced military presence at six bases that will be converted into academies or hubs of new partnerships. He said it would involve "balanced, reciprocal and responsible" relations, respectful of African needs at a time of intense competition for influence and profit across the continent from Russia and China.
"Macron wants to salvage what he can," said Thierry Vircoulon, a research associate at the French Institute of International Relations. "His first term was a failure, both in terms of the war on terrorism and the attempt to maintain French influence."
An era is coming to an end. France left its colonies decades ago, but old habits and presumptions about French power and dominance across a swath of Africa have endured, symbolized by a significant military presence and the continued use of the colonial-era C.F.A. franc currency. French nostalgia for the zenith of their geostrategic influence sustained these tendencies.
"Once and for all we have to get rid of reflexes, habits and forms of language that have become a handicap," Mr. Macron said before leaving on Wednesday on a five-day visit to Gabon, Angola, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo that will end Sunday. "We must adopt a resolutely clearer posture of modesty and listening."
There was nothing modest about Operation Barkhane, the long-running war against Islamist militants that France waged in cooperation with five nations across the vast Sahel region. At one point 5,000 French troops were deployed. The insurgencies survived and the mission grew increasingly unpopular before being terminated in failure last year.
"It was in some ways to France what Afghanistan was to the United States," said Mr. Vircoulon.
Mr. Macron, in a speech before his departure, refused to accept sole French responsibility for the setbacks, saying that he would never again let French troops be "stained" by a situation where France became "the ideal scapegoat."
He did not elaborate, but the Sahel intervention became a symbol of French meddling. Countries including Mali, the Central African Republic and most recently Burkina Faso have turned against the French presence, and France withdrew its troops from all three countries over the past year.
The reversals have stemmed in part from a wave of intense anti-French propaganda, often orchestrated by the Kremlin, playing on the French colonial past. That messaging has resonated with local populations, as mercenaries from Wagner, the Russian military contractor with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin's government, have extended their influence in several African countries.
Mr. Macron's attempts to counter this trend by portraying Russia as the real imperial power of the current era, as illustrated by its war of aggression in Ukraine, have proved largely ineffective.
Mr. Putin's Russia does not build many bridges or hospitals in Africa, but is the master of pitiless protection services, plunder of natural resources and propaganda. It is the continent's largest supplier of arms. It befriends governments, many of them repressive, through hard power. As in Syria, its readiness to use force secures the outcome it seeks.
"Wagner is a group of criminal mercenaries," Mr. Macron said this week. He added: "Its role and aim is to protect failing regimes and putschists and, in the end, provide only security for these as it pursues predatory operations with mines and raw materials."
The problem for France and the West more generally is that the Russian strategy in African conflict zones of taking one side and crushing the other -- sometimes with extreme brutality, as has happened in the Central African Republic -- has often been effective, at least in the short run.
Of the four countries that Mr. Macron will visit, three -- Angola, Republic of Congo and Gabon -- abstained in the vote last month at the United Nations on a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The resolution was adopted with a two-thirds majority, but as these abstentions suggest, many African states have declined to back Western condemnation of Mr. Putin.
They see Western hypocrisy in the moral outrage of the United States and its allies over the Russian invasion, double standards for European as compared to African wars, and amnesia over colonialism. How far Mr. Macron will be able to counter such doubts is unclear.
Mr. Macron portrayed Africa as a land of opportunity on the eve of his departure and will pursue economic cooperation, not least in Angola, where TotalEnergies, the major French oil company, has substantial interests. In Gabon, he will co-host a meeting, known as the One Forest summit, centered on environmental protection. The Congo basin is home to the world's second-largest tropical forest after the Amazon.
"We must no longer think that economic markets are ours by right because we were there before," Mr. Macron said.
The French president, 45, born into a post-colonial generation, is much given to radical reimagining of France's international relations, with mixed results. He embarked in 2019 on an attempt to integrate Russia into a new European security architecture, as he put it, only for Mr. Putin to go to war in Ukraine and anchor his global strategy in a "no limits" anti-Western partnership with China.
Now Mr. Macron has turned his mind to Africa. "I have no nostalgia about France-in-Africa," he said. "But I do not want to leave an absence or a void behind it."

President Emmanuel Macron of France has embarked on a quest to win favor across Africa on the basis of a policy of “profound humility,” chastened by a decadelong frustrated military intervention and a wave of anti-French sentiment in France’s former African colonies.
In practice, as he outlined in a speech this week, this reset will mean a much-reduced military presence at six bases that will be converted into academies or hubs of new partnerships. He said it would involve “balanced, reciprocal and responsible” relations, respectful of African needs at a time of intense competition for influence and profit across the continent from Russia and China.
“Macron wants to salvage what he can,” said Thierry Vircoulon, a research associate at the French Institute of International Relations. “His first term was a failure, both in terms of the war on terrorism and the attempt to maintain French influence.”
An era is coming to an end. France left its colonies decades ago, but old habits and presumptions about French power and dominance across a swath of Africa have endured, symbolized by a significant military presence and the continued use of the colonial-era CFA franc currency. French nostalgia for the zenith of their geostrategic influence sustained these tendencies.
“Once and for all we have to get rid of reflexes, habits and forms of language that have become a handicap,” Macron said before leaving Wednesday on a five-day visit to Gabon, Angola, the Republic of Congo and Congo that will end Sunday. “We must adopt a resolutely clearer posture of modesty and listening.”
There was nothing modest about Operation Barkhane, the long-running war against Islamic militants that France waged in cooperation with five nations across the vast Sahel region. At one point 5,000 French troops were deployed. The insurgencies survived and the mission grew increasingly unpopular before being terminated in failure last year.
“It was in some ways to France what Afghanistan was to the United States,” Vircoulon said.
Macron, in a speech before his departure, refused to accept sole French responsibility for the setbacks, saying that he would never again let French troops be “stained” by a situation where France became “the ideal scapegoat.”
He did not elaborate, but the Sahel intervention became a symbol of French meddling. Countries including Mali, the Central African Republic and most recently Burkina Faso have turned against the French presence, and France withdrew its troops from all three countries over the past year.
The reversals have stemmed in part from a wave of intense anti-French propaganda, often orchestrated by the Kremlin, playing on the French colonial past. That messaging has resonated with local populations, as mercenaries from Wagner, the Russian military contractor with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, have extended their influence in several African countries.
Macron’s attempts to counter this trend by portraying Russia as the real imperial power of the current era, as illustrated by its war of aggression in Ukraine, have proved largely ineffective.
Putin’s Russia does not build many bridges or hospitals in Africa, but is the master of pitiless protection services, plunder of natural resources and propaganda. It is the continent’s largest supplier of arms. It befriends governments, many of them repressive, through hard power. As in Syria, its readiness to use force secures the outcome it seeks.
“Wagner is a group of criminal mercenaries,” Macron said this week. He added: “Its role and aim is to protect failing regimes and putschists and, in the end, provide only security for these as it pursues predatory operations with mines and raw materials.”
The problem for France and the West more generally is that the Russian strategy in African conflict zones of taking one side and crushing the other — sometimes with extreme brutality, as has happened in the Central African Republic — has often been effective, at least in the short run.
Of the four countries that Macron will visit, three — Angola, Republic of Congo and Gabon — abstained in the vote last month at the United Nations on a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The resolution was adopted with a two-thirds majority, but as these abstentions suggest, many African states have declined to back Western condemnation of Putin.
They see Western hypocrisy in the moral outrage of the United States and its allies over the Russian invasion, double standards for European as compared to African wars, and amnesia over colonialism. How far Macron will be able to counter such doubts is unclear.
Macron portrayed Africa as a land of opportunity on the eve of his departure and will pursue economic cooperation, not least in Angola, where TotalEnergies, the major French oil company, has substantial interests. In Gabon, he will co-host a meeting, known as the One Forest summit, centered on environmental protection. The Congo basin is home to the world’s second-largest tropical forest after the Amazon.
“We must no longer think that economic markets are ours by right because we were there before,” Macron said.
The French president, 45, born into a post-colonial generation, is much given to radical reimagining of France’s international relations, with mixed results. He embarked in 2019 on an attempt to integrate Russia into a new European security architecture, as he put it, only for Putin to go to war in Ukraine and anchor his global strategy in a “no limits” anti-Western partnership with China.
Now Macron has turned his mind to Africa. “I have no nostalgia about France-in-Africa,” he said. “But I do not want to leave an absence or a void behind it.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

In a Plot Twist, an Editor Turns Debut Author: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Jenny Jackson, a publishing executive with a stellar record as an editor, has a novel of her own, "Pineapple Street." With it come uncertainties she has long helped her authors navigate.
Jenny Jackson means onetime Brooklyn Heights resident Truman Capote no disrespect, and his quote "I live in Brooklyn. By choice" serves as an epigraph to "Pineapple Street," her first novel. But Jackson sets off on a walking tour with a different Brooklyn Heights in her sights.
She gestures toward the red brick Heights Casino, where the novel's old-money Brooklyn plays tennis year-round, and the St. George Hotel, which catered to Brooklyn's rich of the Jazz Age. There's the imposing bay-windowed house on Columbia Heights that inspired the heirloom-stuffed limestone at the heart of the book. And the Joe Coffee on the corner of Pineapple and Hicks streets is where Georgiana, the youngest daughter of "Pineapple Street"'s adamantly Social Register Stockton family, utters the immortal line, "Oh no, I left my Cartier tennis bracelet in Lena's BMW and she's leaving for her grandmother's house in Southampton" as she is fatefully spotted by the reluctant heir to a zillion-dollar defense fortune.
Darley, Georgiana's older sister, is a former finance crusher and increasingly reluctant stay-at- $ 10-million-home mom, while their mother, a ski-pole-thin event planner, has never met an issue of the Yale Alumni Magazine she didn't scour for prospects for her unmarried daughter. Stuck, uncomfortably, in the middle, is Sasha, the middle-class New England girl who has married their brother, Cord, and, despite all signs to the contrary, is referred to as "the Gold Digger" by her sisters-in-law.
"It's the novel Jane Austen would have written," said the author Chris Bohjalian, "if Jane Austen lived in Brooklyn Heights in the 21st century."
But Jane Austen didn't hold a high-profile position in publishing, as well: Jackson, the author with a splashy debut on her hands, is also a vice-president and executive editor at Alfred A. Knopf. Bohjalian is one of her authors.
Jackson's foray into writing came as a surprise to most who know her, not least those who have known her as editor, and raised questions: How will Jackson deploy her skills in her new circumstances? And what does it feel like to be on the other side of the author-publisher relationship?
"It was like finding out your spouse is an Olympic equestrian," said the author Kevin Kwan, who hit the publishing stratosphere with Jackson as his editor on "Crazy Rich Asians." "Or better, given her natural skills, an Olympic gymnast."
Since joining Vintage, Knopf's paperback arm, in 2002, fresh out of Williams and the Columbia Publishing Course, and segueing to Knopf's hardcover shop nine years after that, Jackson, 43, has established herself as a literary hitmaker with a track record of fostering best-selling authors who straddle the line between literary and commercial fiction, and nonfiction on occasion as well. With a vociferously loyal roster that ranges from such authors as Gabrielle Zevin and Emily St. John Mandel to Bohjalian, Peter Heller, Katherine Heiny, Jennifer Close, Esmeralda Santiago, Helen Ellis and the actress Selma Blair, she is also considered extraordinarily adept at helping market and promote her authors.
Zevin's star-crossed gamers saga, "Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow," topped Amazon's list of Best Books of 2022, ended up a Jimmy Fallon Book Club pick, and got a rare John Green recommendation. Almost the minute that Amazon's Times Square billboard went up trumpeting the novel as its "#1" choice, Jackson shared it on her busy Instagram.
"She's a complete star," said the literary agent Amanda Urban, who, 10 years ago -- on the advice of the late Sonny Mehta, Jackson's boss and mentor -- entrusted Cormac McCarthy and his long-gestating works in progress to a young Jackson. The two linked novels McCarthy delivered were heavy on esoteric mathematics, physics and intelligence theory.
"More than anyone around," Urban said of Jackson, "she instinctively knew how to talk about these books." "The Passenger," published in October of last year, and "Stella Maris," released in December, were greeted as a triumphant comeback for McCarthy.
Jackson said she was almost as surprised as the rest of the publishing world that she'd written a novel. Like countless others, she had felt isolated and unsettled as the pandemic "changed the world and the way we lived," she said. Far from her normal epicenter among a younger cohort spanning a swath of publishing houses and literary agencies, Jackson wrote the novel, she said, in place of being able to talk and gossip and socialize with what had seemed to have become a vanished world.
For the first six months of the pandemic, she and her husband, Torrey Liddell -- a partner at the production company Surreel Films -- and their two young children lived with his parents at their country house in Sharon, Conn., not far from Hotchkiss, where both Liddell and his father had gone to boarding school. "I love Torrey's family," Jackson said, "but they're not my family." The complications of marrying into someone else's family drive "Pineapple Street"'s fish-out-of-gene-pool plot.
The question around Viking and its Pamela Dorman imprint is whether the book, which comes out March 7 with an announced first printing of 50,000, could emerge as a "Sex and the City" that gets its sugar rush not at Magnolia Bakery but at Le French Tart on Henry Street where Jackson favors the almond croissants. Sold in a pre-emptive deal for a reported seven figures in April 2021, the novel is under option as a TV series by the production company PictureStart. Although Publishers Weekly called it "a clever if tepid debut," Kirkus Reviews judged the novel a "remarkably enjoyable visit with the annoying one percent, as close to crazy rich WASPs as WASPs can get."
Jackson wrote "Pineapple Street" in just four months after she read The New York Times article "The Rich Kids Who Want to Tear Down Capitalism," about millennial one-percenters' distinctly ambivalent relationship with the millions they stand to inherit. The conundrum visits the Stocktons in "Pineapple Street" when Georgiana grows a social conscience and decides to give away her trust fund.
The book's approaching launch has Park Avenue on high alert. The Colony Club and the Cosmo Club have asked about hosting events with Jackson. She said she remembers the first time she was invited to lunch at the Colony Club. Still an entry-level editorial assistant, she arrived wearing black jeans, "the nice J. Crew kind," Jackson said with a laugh. Lunch had to be moved. She never made a mistake like that again.
"For someone who's written a novel about class, I came to it surprisingly late," said Jackson, who was raised in Ipswich, Mass., and attended a small progressive private school where teachers were called by their first names. She used to pass John Updike's house there when she went for a run, she said. Now she is rereading his book "Couples" because she's setting her next novel there.
In contrast, at Williams, where she studied poetry, she said she discovered that "there was a whole group of kids who took private planes for spring break."
As a seasoned editor, Jackson has witnessed the eggshell egos and creative struggles of many of her authors, and has ridden the ups and downs of their insecurities and rough drafts. "Pineapple Street" had the potential of throwing the same emotional obstacle course her way.
J. Courtney Sullivan, whose first novel, "Commencement," began her string of best sellers with Jackson, talked through some of those vulnerabilities with her, she said, and "how, as a writer, you have to put so much of yourself out there, and the risks that holds, the vulnerability."
Jennifer Close, who has been with Jackson since they made "Girls in White Dresses" a best seller in 2011, exchanged texts with her almost daily. "The first time she got notes back for revisions," Close said, "she texted me, 'I hate revising. This is miserable. How do you not hate me?' It was funny, because she's a person her authors love."
"I feel like I've always been sensitive to my authors," Jackson said. "But it's gone up a level. I'm never going to just dismiss a rude email one of them gets ever again."
No one does fun like Jackson, her authors say, while keeping her editorial focus paper-cut sharp. She is a perpetual standout at the competitive game nights that Ellis holds as fund-raisers every year for One Story magazine. At the last gathering, Jackson dipped into the Truth or Dare bag for extra points and found herself drawing a Sharpie tattoo of a skull and cross bones on Bohjalian's arm.
Jackson likes to joke that she "has the most boring résumé in publishing" because she hasn't exactly moved around in her career. Zevin frames it differently, describing Jackson, and her trajectory, as a full-blown video game.
"A plucky adventurer," Zevin wrote in an email, "let's call her Jenny Jackson, because honestly, this is a very good video game character name! -- travels through worlds to collect a series of tomes that, in combination, will unlock the secrets of civilization and maybe even save it!
"Her quest will take her from a post-apocalyptic landscape in the Midwest, to the elite world of the ultrarich in Singapore, and to many worlds in between. To collect the tomes, she must be highly observant, empathetic, and a master of language and transformation.
"In the final level, she reaches a world that is unexpected, but strangely familiar: It's a world of her own devising."

The ‘It’ Coat This Winter Is … a Pasta Puffer?

When Bani Randhawa started wearing her new coat a few months ago, something funny happened: Strangers smiled at her as they passed. Babies in strollers pointed at her. Others stopped her on the street, all with the same question: Is that farfalle on your jacket?
“I have never experienced that while wearing another article of clothing,” said Randhawa, 27, who attends business school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The coat in question is the Rachel Antonoff Parker Puffer, a short, black jacket printed with golden images of bow tie pasta.
In a sea of drab, black winter coats, the pasta puffer stands alone. “You are that girl when you wear it,” Randhawa said.
The coat has suddenly become a seasonal phenomenon in cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Social media is littered with photos of people posing in it. Actor Mindy Kaling has worn it. So has actor Dylan O’Brien. The farfalle has become Rachel Antonoff’s bestselling print, and the jacket — which retails for $425 — has sold out three times since it was introduced at the end of 2021, Antonoff said.
“I feel like a winter coat with pasta all over it is a little bit of joy,” she said.
This winter, the pasta puffer has been especially conspicuous. Lauren Goldstein, 26, who works in social media and marketing in New York’s Manhattan borough and owns the coat, said this could be a result of the unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country, which allows for outerwear that prioritizes fashion over function.
The pasta coat is “my entire personality this winter,” she said.
It’s not unheard-of for outerwear to develop a cult following (see: the $100-ish Amazon Coat that took New York by storm in 2018). But the pasta puffer seems more niche.
“Before the pandemic, we were very often told, ‘This is way too loud, too much, this doesn’t merchandise,’” said Antonoff, who has been making food-themed garments like babka sweaters and dresses decorated with seafood towers since 2015. Then the lockdowns happened, and many people spending their workdays on Zoom calls were looking for a way to provoke conversation. “We noticed that people are being seen from waist up, and they wanted to have a big bagel on their sweater.”
The excitement for those styles has remained, she said.
Laura Nguyen, an account executive in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of New York, said that during the pandemic she grew tired of her “bluish-gray professional clothes” from Ann Taylor. She decided to refresh her wardrobe, and at the end of 2021 rented the pasta puffer from the website Rent the Runway.
“Adding food into patterns and fashion is like the new florals,” said Nguyen, 25.
Sam Hwang, 25, who lives in Huntington Beach, California, and also owns the coat, said its popularity speaks to the way many people are more body-positive, and make their favorite dishes part of their identity. Other designers, like Lisa Says Gah and Susan Alexandra, have drawn attention for their food-themed fashion.
Rental companies have also played a role in the pasta puffer’s ubiquity. The coat has been rented more than 1,000 times through the clothing rental service Nuuly. On Rent the Runway, rentals of the coat grew by 10% from fall and winter of 2021 to the same period in 2022 — a rarity for any item of clothing, said Jennifer Hyman, the company’s co-founder and CEO.
A bold jacket like the pasta puffer is ideal for temporary ownership, said Sarah Margulies, 29, a Boston-area lawyer who rented the coat in January. “It kind of only works once,” she said.
“You go to an event with the pasta coat, and you talk about the pasta coat. It is not going to be as impressive the second time you see it.”
But the effect the coat seems to have on people is undeniable.
Sarah Katz-Hyman, 33, who works for a nonprofit in San Francisco and rented the coat last spring on Nuuly, said it made her more extroverted. “It is nice to be able to put on a piece of clothing and Sasha Fierce it,” she said.
She missed the coat so much after she returned it that she posted on Twitter a video montage of herself wearing it, set to the plaintive Sarah McLachlan song “Angel.” Someone at Nuuly saw the tweet and sent her a free coat.
“People were giddy when they saw me wearing it,” said Hannah Tate, 29, who works at a health products company in Chicago. She rented the coat in December and again in January.
Katey Ghobrial, who works in marketing at Yelp in New York, said a server at Greenwich Village restaurant Minetta Tavern sat down at her table to discuss the pasta puffer when she wore it to dinner recently.
“I feel like a total celebrity,” said Ghobrial, 32.
But many pasta puffer enthusiasts also acknowledged the jacket’s downsides: It’s not very warm. It’s boxy. It’s expensive.
Alex Bruza, 31, an advertising employee in Los Angeles, rented the coat in December and said it was “not that flattering,” as it “jutted out on the bottom, and it made me look a little bigger.”
But with a coat like this, it’s not really about the fit. It’s about the joy.
“I was still obsessed with it,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Although Publishers Weekly called it “a clever if tepid debut,” Kirkus Reviews judged the novel a “remarkably enjoyable visit with the annoying 1%, as close to crazy rich WASPs as WASPs can get.”
Jackson wrote “Pineapple Street” in just four months after she read The New York Times article “The Rich Kids Who Want to Tear Down Capitalism,” about millennial one-percenters’ distinctly ambivalent relationship with the millions they stand to inherit. The conundrum visits the Stocktons in “Pineapple Street” when Georgiana grows a social conscience and decides to give away her trust fund.
The book’s approaching launch has Park Avenue on high alert. The Colony Club and the Cosmo Club have asked about hosting events with Jackson. She said she remembers the first time she was invited to lunch at the Colony Club. Still an entry-level editorial assistant, she arrived wearing black jeans, “the nice J. Crew kind,” Jackson said with a laugh. Lunch had to be moved. She never made a mistake like that again.
“For someone who’s written a novel about class, I came to it surprisingly late,” said Jackson, who was raised in Ipswich, Massachusetts, and attended a small progressive private school where teachers were called by their first names. She used to pass John Updike’s house there when she went for a run, she said. Now she is rereading his book “Couples” because she’s setting her next novel there.
In contrast, at Williams, where she studied poetry, she said she discovered that “there was a whole group of kids who took private planes for spring break.”
As a seasoned editor, Jackson has witnessed the eggshell egos and creative struggles of many of her authors, and has ridden the ups and downs of their insecurities and rough drafts. “Pineapple Street” had the potential of throwing the same emotional obstacle course her way.
J. Courtney Sullivan, whose first novel, “Commencement,” began her string of bestsellers with Jackson, talked through some of those vulnerabilities with her, she said, and “how, as a writer, you have to put so much of yourself out there, and the risks that holds, the vulnerability.”
Jennifer Close, who has been with Jackson since they made “Girls in White Dresses” a bestseller in 2011, exchanged texts with her almost daily. “The first time she got notes back for revisions,” Close said, “she texted me, ‘I hate revising. This is miserable. How do you not hate me?’ It was funny, because she’s a person her authors love.”
“I feel like I’ve always been sensitive to my authors,” Jackson said. “But it’s gone up a level. I’m never going to just dismiss a rude email one of them gets ever again.”
No one does fun like Jackson, her authors say, while keeping her editorial focus paper-cut sharp. She is a perpetual standout at the competitive game nights that Ellis holds as fundraisers every year for One Story magazine. At the last gathering, Jackson dipped into the Truth or Dare bag for extra points and found herself drawing a Sharpie tattoo of a skull and cross bones on Bohjalian’s arm.
Jackson likes to joke that she “has the most boring résumé in publishing” because she hasn’t exactly moved around in her career. Zevin frames it differently, describing Jackson, and her trajectory, as a full-blown video game.
“A plucky adventurer,” Zevin wrote in an email, “let’s call her Jenny Jackson, because honestly, this is a very good video game character name! — travels through worlds to collect a series of tomes that, in combination, will unlock the secrets of civilization and maybe even save it!
“Her quest will take her from a post-apocalyptic landscape in the Midwest, to the elite world of the ultrarich in Singapore, and to many worlds in between. To collect the tomes, she must be highly observant, empathetic, and a master of language and transformation.
“In the final level, she reaches a world that is unexpected, but strangely familiar: It’s a world of her own devising.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: The maker of electric trucks said it expected to double production in 2023 as the supply of parts became more reliable.
Rivian, a maker of electric trucks, said on Tuesday that it lost $ 1.7 billion in the final three months of last year as it struggled with production difficulties.
The loss brings the company's total losses for 2022 to $ 6.8 billion and highlights the troubles that once-promising start-ups are having gaining ground on Tesla, which dominates the electric vehicle business. Last week, another young automaker, Lucid Motors, said that it lost $ 2.6 billion in 2022.
Rivian said the supply chain problems that dogged it last year would continue this year but become easier to anticipate. The company said it expected to produce 50,000 vehicles this year, roughly twice as many as it did in 2022.
In a conference call, Rivian's chief executive, R.J. Scaringe, said the company was working to reduce costs, especially now that Tesla had cut the prices of its cars by as much as 20 percent. Driving costs down "is our core challenge today," Mr. Scaringe said.
He added that demand remained "robust," noting that the company had a backlog of orders that it expected to last into 2024.
Rivian brought in $ 663 million in revenue, and delivered 8,054 vehicles, in the fourth quarter of 2022. On a full-year basis, it had revenue of $ 1.7 billion, and delivered 20,332 vehicles, in 2022. It produced 24,337 vehicles last year, just short of its reduced goal of 25,000.
The company said it had $ 11.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December, down from $ 18.1 billion a year earlier.
Rivian, which is based in Irvine, Calif., makes an electric pickup truck, a sport utility vehicle and a delivery van. The company has attracted several deep-pocketed investors, including Amazon, which has placed a large order for the manufacturer's vans. Ford Motor also invested in the company but ultimately decided not to collaborate with Rivian and sold most of its stock.
The company's inability to quickly increase production at its plant in Normal, Ill., has limited sales, and its stock price has plunged. On Tuesday, it was trading around $ 19, down from around $ 47 a year earlier. The company's share price was about 8 percent lower in extended trading after the release of its earnings report.
Rivian said it expected to report a loss of $ 4.3 billion in 2023 before taking into account interest, tax and other expenses.

Full text: All clothes wear out -- but you can breathe new life into tired duds and keep beloved staples looking better for longer with the right supplies and a little know-how. We consulted Patric Richardson, a textile care expert and author of "Laundry Love," and Madeline Miller, a product specialist at The Laundress, for their tips and advice. ZOE VANDERWEIDE and DORIE CHEVLEN
Hand-washing detergent For the most part, you don't need a specialty detergent; ordinary Tide is mild enough for most fabrics and is highly effective against stains. But use it only on plant-based or synthetic fibers. When washing protein-based fibers such as silk or wool, we recommend a no-rinse detergent to minimize handling. Our favorite for the job was Soak, which is versatile enough to hand wash a range of persnickety fabrics. For wool only, the no-rinse Eucalan Fine Fabric Wash cleans better and also contains softening and protective lanolin.
Mesh laundry bags If you prefer the ease of a machine for delicate laundry, a mesh bag can protect bras, swimsuits and sweaters. We recommend the Muchfun Honeycomb Mesh Laundry Bags, which have zippers that are secured with snug elastic covers.
A drying rack For most garments -- from bras and socks to tees and blue jeans -- an accordion-style drying rack is practical, compact and easy to store. But you should keep one thing in mind. "Wet clothes can be quite heavy," said Mr. Richardson, so you'll want something sturdy, too. In testing, the Amazon Basics Foldable Laundry Rack did a great job at a lower price than others we tried. Or consider a bigger rack like the gull-wing-style Songmics Clothes Drying Rack, which has adjustable shelves.
A garment steamer. Heat and pressure from an iron can crush and warp delicate yarns. The Conair Turbo ExtremeSteam Garment Steamer was our favorite. Its powerful steam blasts quickly erased wrinkles without spitting water -- a rarity among the steamers we tried.
Also helpful are a fabric shaver or sweater comb that can transform pilled garments, and a lint roller to lift errant hairs, dust and fuzz with a few satisfying passes.

The Freshly Unemployed, Sent Reeling, Land on TikTok: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some workers are using the platform to share stories about job cuts, give advice and search for new roles.
Bailey Harris, 25, worked as a recruiter for a big tech company for more than a year and a half before she was laid off in January. After the initial shock wore off, she decided to tell her story three days later on TikTok. "I was never really worried about layoffs," she said in the video, which she recorded from a car. "I just didn't see this coming," she added.
It was only the second TikTok video Ms. Harris had ever made, but within a day it had more than 100,000 views. That number has since quadrupled.
She continued to post about being newly unemployed. In one, she shared how she was saving money. In another, she told her viewers about a new side hustle helping a friend flip real estate. (These videos performed much better than the others she later posted, which focused on topics like dating, fitness and nutrition.)
"I was like, 'This is relevant -- why not speak about it because I know a lot of people have been going through the same thing?"' she said. The videos, she continued, were "getting a lot of comments about how people like my attitude toward my situation."
As tech workers continue to get laid off across the country -- more than 50,000 employees were let go from Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft alone in the last few months -- some have turned to TikTok to share their experiences.
An emerging microgenre on the platform, layoff vlogs can be a source of validation and community, or a self-esteem boost, for young workers who have recently lost their jobs. In these videos, some creators vent about their former employers or expose perceived wrongdoings. Others have a more practical objective in mind: using the platform to find their next gig.
Mass layoffs by companies are hardly new, and neither is the idea that former employees will find an outlet to talk about what happened to them. When some nine million Americans lost their jobs in the 2008 financial crisis, workers might have called each other, met up at a bar or posted on Facebook and Twitter.
And during the last major economic upheaval at the beginning of the pandemic -- over a single week in March, more than three million Americans became unemployed -- TikTok was another available avenue. But while some workers did use the platform for talking about layoffs, a majority of the videos didn't resonate as they do now.
"This is the first time employees can get laid off, and press record on their phone and have something go mega-mega-megaviral," said Gabrielle Judge, a content creator who helps women find jobs in tech. She noted that platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, where disgruntled employees might have gone in the past to vent, don't have the same viral potential as TikTok.
Calon DiPiero, 30, said that when she was laid off last month from an event planning job at Attentive Mobile, an S.M.S. marketing platform, she filmed a TikTok video to keep her situation in perspective. The caption read: "When you were laid off so you spent the last 48 hours crying in the same comfort hoodie but then you remember you're just unemployed not ugly." Posting the video helped her overcome the shame she felt when she was first let go, she said.
"Initially, if this happens, your ego gets bruised," Ms. DiPiero said. "But then if you can take a step back and say, OK, this is happening to a lot of people. It's not a personal vendetta against me."
Tech recruiters said TikTok could be helpful for networking and job hunting. Dozens of companies, including Target, Chipotle and Sweetgreen, have used the app for hiring.
"If you say in a video that you would love to connect with anyone who has a role for you, a lot of people will see it," said Jonathan Javier, the chief executive and founder of Wonsulting, which helps people, especially those who come from nontraditional backgrounds, find jobs in tech.
The trick, Mr. Javier said, is to strike the right tone: "If you are a prospective employer, seeing someone vent about a past employer can be a red flag. I encourage everyone to stay positive, to focus on the actions you are taking to find a new job."
Some people are heeding that advice. Ms. Harris, for example, opted not to say which company she worked for in her videos. "Obviously people can do their research and find out where I worked through LinkedIn," she said. "But I really wanted to stay positive and not name names."
Brit Levy, 35, who said she was laid off by Meta in November, used TikTok to talk about her frustrations with the severance agreement she said the company was offering, amassing almost 800,000 views. Dozens of former Meta employees reached out to her after the series of videos she posted, she said. "We are finding a little community with each other," said Ms. Levy, who lives in Oceanside, Calif.
She said she has also had hiring managers reach out to offer support and give her professional advice on the next steps she should take in her career.
TikTok creators who share details about the circumstances of their layoffs, however, can risk legal trouble, depending on which they talk about. "There are many companies that require you to sign documents to get your severance package," Mr. Javier said. "If they sign a form, there are legal implications."
Ms. Levy said she wasn't worried about the potential consequences of speaking publicly about a former employer.
"Honestly, they should be worried about ramifications from me," she said. "I now know how to get eyes on an issue I feel is super important."

Snow? Graupel? Whatever Is Falling, It’s Making Californians Giddy

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Stay in, the meteorologists had said. Historic blizzards are coming to California. There will be snowplows.
And yet, some things must be seen to be believed.
In Silicon Valley, in the hills above Los Gatos, Bart Giordano awoke at midnight Friday to watch the snowfall piling up on the pine limbs and blanketing his patio lounge chairs, drifts like nothing he had seen in the area in his 46 years.
To the north, Danny Cullenward, an energy economist up with a fussy 4-year-old, looked out the window and saw lightning and heard a rumble and then glimpsed a distinct kind of falling slush that he recalled from his childhood in the Midwest. Snow is so rare in most of California that residents went deep into the weather glossary to describe it.
“Thundergraupel in San Francisco!” he joyfully tweeted, playing on a suddenly buzzy word for precipitation that is not quite hail or snowflakes.
“I was like a giddy kid before Christmas,” he later confessed.
California is a big place, and its high elevations and ski slopes are as snow-prone as those in the next state. Even the warmer parts of Southern California get an occasional dusting.
But snow is not the Golden State’s claim to fame, generally speaking. The storm is so extraordinary that it came with an almost unprecedented blizzard warning in Southern California for Friday and Saturday. State and local officials warned residents to stay off the roads and avoid the mountains, out of concern that many could be stranded in frigid conditions they had never faced before.
Already on Friday, the storm had forced the closure of the main north-south route, Interstate 5, at the Grapevine between Los Angeles and the Central Valley. At various times, it shut down Interstate 80 over the Sierra Nevada and caused vehicles of all sizes to spin out on various roadways.
Still, amid dangerous conditions and serious threats to motorists, many Californians emerged to see what fresh novelty the sky had dropped — and to take selfies, naturally.
Social media generated its own blizzard: snow days in Yucaipa, snow on the Bakersfield Cemetery tombstones, snow in the mountains in San Luis Obispo, snow on the Victorian homes of Eureka.
In the Santa Cruz Mountains, Melissa Leib was so struck by the winter wonderland outside her house that instead of her normal Friday posts about feng shui, she paid tribute to the “Freaky Friday” weather in her backyard.
Darshan Gooch, a well-known Santa Cruz surfer, had laughed out loud as snow fell on Twin Lakes State Beach, an “epic” moment he had pulled over to capture as he headed across town Thursday morning to pick up some wet suits.
“I knew we had an unusual storm system coming through, but I was a little shocked when it actually happened,” he said Friday. “It didn’t stick, but just to see it was beautiful.”
In Los Angeles, residents became obsessed with determining whether snow had actually fallen on the Hollywood sign. Some believed it had to be snow, while others said it was hail or even a more exotic form of precipitation.
The National Weather Service was on the case. “After a little investigating and with the help of the ALERT CA cameras, we are confident in saying snow or graupel fell on Mt. Lee (where the Hollywood sign sits),” the service tweeted Thursday evening.
By Friday morning, Eric Boldt, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, could confirm it had been graupel, which he defined as “basically snowflakes wrapped in ice.”
At that point, a brief flurry was again swirling around the Hollywood sign. Watching it through his window, Craig Robert Young, an English-born actor who has lived for 22 years in Los Angeles, three of them in the Hollywood Hills, said that the familiar sign had been coated in white the day before, as had his patio chairs and table.
“It was kind of bizarre,” Young, 49, said. “I wanted my husband to have a snowball fight.”
Kaan Ulupiner, 21, a University of California, Berkeley, student, had rented skis for a weekend trip to Tahoe. But the main highway, Interstate 80, was closed in the Sierra Nevada because drivers were spinning out and blinded by snow.
What else to do but trudge up the Berkeley Hills behind campus and turn it into a most unusual ski run?
“I was feeling quite down this morning until kind of a miracle happened,” he said. “I was like, all right, guess I’m skiing one way or another.”
In the Central Valley community of Patterson, known for its apricots and its huge Amazon warehouse, the hills to the west were coated in white. Chuck Marble, 64, a retiree whose pastimes include following the weather on radar, said he had noticed Friday morning that snow had fallen nearby and drove through a torrential rain to bear witness: “I said, ‘I’m not going to miss this!’”
By midday Friday, the thrill was fading. In the lower elevations, snow had turned to rain, and in the higher ones, the heavy amount was starting to become worrisome. In Southern California, Boldt, the meteorologist, warned of winds of up to 80 mph and white-out visibility in elevations higher than 4,500 feet.
In Northern California, Giordano, a father of three, said his family’s power had gone out as “at least a foot” of snow had accumulated, snapping off tree limbs and blocking ingress and egress.
“We’re on generator power with backup internet,” he said. “We’re stocked up with food, and the kids are out on their sled having a good old time. But what started as a very charming snowstorm is turning into, you know, how are we going to get out of our house?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Though most people rely on an alarm clock (or the clock on a smartphone) to get out of bed, you can use a slew of smart gear to make waking up easier. RACHEL CERICOLA
Smart speakers. Not only do smart speakers respond to voice commands and control smart-home devices, they also make great alarm clocks. The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen, with clock) is a compact and affordable model that allows you to set daily or weekly alarms and choose from many alarm sounds. You can also create a wake-up routine where the alarm triggers connected devices, such as smart bulbs, thermostats and window shades.
A smart wake-up light. Wake-up lights gradually increase the brightness by your bedside, gently easing you into the day. They add a variety of light options and sounds, and can be set up to trigger other smart-home devices. The Amazon Halo Rise combines a wake-up light, an alarm clock and a sleep tracker. It also collects information about your previous night's sleep, like how much you slept, how deeply and ambient conditions in your room.
Smart LED bulbs. For a cheaper alternative to a wake-up light, smart light bulbs are easy to add to lamps and other light fixtures. Once the bulb is screwed in and connected to your Wi-Fi, you can use its app to schedule wake-up times and even select what color you want the light to be.
Smart window shades. Smart window shades can let in the morning sun at a set time each day -- or be set up to rise and close automatically based on local sunrise and sunset times. All of them allow for remote control using a smartphone, and many can be controlled through voice commands when paired with Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri or Google Home.
Temperature controls. Having the right temperature in your room can make getting out of bed easier. A smart thermostat can be adjusted remotely using an app or by voice via a smart speaker, so you can tweak temperatures from your bed. The Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium can even learn your preferences, then adjust temperatures automatically to match your daily routine.

Democrat To Exit Post Representing Rhode Island: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Rhode Island Democrat, who is in his seventh term, served as a manager in former President Donald J. Trump's second impeachment trial.
WASHINGTON -- Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and an impeachment manager in the second trial of former President Donald J. Trump, announced Tuesday that he would be leaving Congress in June.
Mr. Cicilline, 61, will become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, the state's largest funder of nonprofit organizations.
In a statement, Mr. Cicilline called the job offer "unexpected" but one he felt he could not turn down.
"It is an extraordinary opportunity to have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state," he said. "The same energy and commitment I brought to elected office, I will now bring as CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, advancing their mission to ensure all Rhode Islanders can achieve economic security; access quality, affordable health care; and attain the education and training that will set them on a path to prosperity."
In his seventh term in Congress, Mr. Cicilline is a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees. He is also a member of the Democratic leadership.
He will remain in office until June 1, and his staff will continue to assist constituents until a new member is elected to finish the remainder of the two-year term.
In 2019, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Cicilline worked to investigate Mr. Trump during House Democrats' first impeachment effort. He took on a larger role as an impeachment manager in Mr. Trump's second trial after a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021.
"Since his resounding defeat in the presidential election in November, Donald Trump has done everything but concede to the democratic will of the American people," Mr. Cicilline wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times published ahead of the impeachment trial.
He added: "We cannot let this go unanswered. With each day, Mr. Trump grows more and more desperate. We should not allow him to menace the security of our country for a second longer."
Mr. Cicilline also led a subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law. In his work on antitrust law, he oversaw what experts described as among the most serious congressional inquiries into potential anticompetitive corporate behavior in decades, focusing on some of the country's most powerful tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook.
Before joining Congress, Mr. Cicilline worked as a public defender in Washington and served two terms as the mayor of Providence, R.I., where he was the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.
Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called Mr. Cicilline an "effective and thoughtful legislator" and a "close friend."
"David has been a leading advocate for L.G.B.T.Q. Americans in the fight for full equality under the law, and he has led House Democrats in our efforts to get weapons of war off of our streets to end the gun violence epidemic once and for all," he said. "He has been a dedicated defender of our democracy."
Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the progressive group Public Citizen, said in a statement that Mr. Cicilline "will leave behind a substantial and meaningful legacy in Congress -- from reinvigorating antitrust policy, to helping to lead the charge for progressive regulatory policy reform, to spearheading landmark anti-discrimination legislation for the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community."
"He will be sorely missed," she added.

Times Wins Polk Awards for News on Ukraine and Hasidic Schools: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Times was honored for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and a photo of war victims, as well as for its reporting on private schools for Hasidic Jews in New York.
The New York Times won three George Polk Awards, two for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and one for an investigation into Hasidic Jewish schools in New York that denied students a basic education.
On Monday, Long Island University, which has run the prestigious Polk Awards for journalism since 1949, announced winners in 15 categories chosen from 515 submissions. A special award went to the youngest ever recipient of a Polk.
"Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes," John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. "And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril."
The Times won the prize for foreign reporting. That submission included daily reporting on the war in Ukraine as well as a feature by Roger Cohen on President Vladimir V. Putin's "22-year slide from statesman to tyrant" in Russia. The Times's submission also included "Putin's War," a 13,000-word, two-month investigation that exposed Russia's powerful military as unprepared, ill-equipped and badly managed.
The Times also won the education reporting award for work by Eliza Shapiro and Brian M. Rosenthal that exposed how private schools in New York's Hasidic Jewish community were failing to provide students with an adequate education, despite receiving more than a quarter of a billion dollars in public funds annually.
Lynsey Addario of The Times won the photojournalism award for a photo that captured the horror in Ukraine. In the photo, the bodies of a Ukrainian mother, her two children and a family friend lay on the ground after they were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to flee Ukraine. The citation for the award noted that Ms. Addario "dove for cover as the shell landed and then took the gruesome photo on instinct."
The award for war reporting was given to Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant of The Associated Press. The A.P. was the last remaining Western news organization in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol after it came under fire from Russia, and the team of journalists documented the siege for almost three weeks before escaping.
The national reporting award went to Josh Gerstein, Alex Ward, Peter Canellos and the staff of Politico for their stunning scoop on a rare leak from the Supreme Court: a draft of the ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years. The official decision from the court came less than two months later. Politico continued its reporting with articles that examined the court's conservative majority and its hunt for the leaker of the draft.
John Archibald, Ashley Remkus and Ramsey Archibald of the news website AL.com won the prize for local reporting for an investigation into how the police force of the tiny town of Brookside, Ala., preyed on poorer residents with an aggressive increase in traffic citations and vehicle seizures, resulting in 640 percent growth in the town's revenues over two years.
The Reuters series "Undocumented and Underage," by Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke, which also focused on Alabama, won for state reporting. The Reuters team revealed the widespread use of migrant children for illegal labor at factories that supply auto parts to Hyundai and Kia, as well as at chicken plants.
The health reporting award went to Kendall Taggart, John Templon, Anthony Cormier and Jason Leopold of BuzzFeed News for their investigation into the dire conditions at a chain of group homes for people with disabilities after it was bought by KKR, a private equity firm.
Ian Allison and Tracy Wang from the online cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk won the financial reporting honor for their work in exposing problems in the relationship between Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX and his trading firm, Alameda Research. The article set in motion the rapid implosion of both firms, and days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. FTX customers and traders have lost billions of dollars, and Mr. Bankman-Fried is facing federal fraud charges.
A six-part series, "The Amazon, Undone," by Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, won the environmental reporting prize. It illuminated the ways in which Brazil has failed to protect the rainforest, pushing it to the brink of destruction.
The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of "911 call analysis," which claims to assess a caller's guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The foreign television award went to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, Kavitha Chekuru and Laila Al-Arian for "The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh," a segment on Al Jazeera English's Fault Lines program. The team examined the shooting death by the Israeli military of Ms. Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who was reporting in the West Bank.
Shimon Prokupecz, a senior crime and justice correspondent for CNN, and his crew were honored for national television reporting for their coverage of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, and of law enforcement's delay in challenging the gunman.
A special award was given to Theo Baker, a student at Stanford University and a reporter for The Stanford Daily, for uncovering allegations that some research papers co-written by Stanford University's president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, contained manipulated images. The university is now investigating the allegations. Mr. Baker, 18, is the son of two journalists -- Peter Baker of The New York Times and Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker, and is the youngest recipient of a Polk Award, according to Mr. Darnton.
The Sydney H. Schanberg prize, which honors long-form investigative journalism, was awarded to Alex Perry, a freelance journalist who chronicled a 2021 ISIS attack in a remote town in Mozambique for Outside magazine.

The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of “911 call analysis,” which claims to assess a caller’s guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The foreign television award went to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, Kavitha Chekuru and Laila Al-Arian for “The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh,” a segment on Al-Jazeera English’s Fault Lines program. The team examined the shooting death by the Israeli military of Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who was reporting in the West Bank.
Shimon Prokupecz, a senior crime and justice correspondent for CNN, and his crew were honored for national television reporting for their coverage of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, and of law enforcement’s delay in challenging the gunman.
A special award was given to Theo Baker, a student at Stanford University and a reporter for The Stanford Daily, for uncovering allegations that some research papers co-written by Stanford University’s president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, contained manipulated images. The university is now investigating the allegations. Baker, 18, is the son of two journalists — Peter Baker of The New York Times and Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker — and is the youngest recipient of a Polk Award, according to Darnton.
The Sydney H. Schanberg prize, which honors long-form investigative journalism, was awarded to Alex Perry, a freelance journalist who chronicled a 2021 Islamic State group attack in a remote town in Mozambique for Outside magazine. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Spending on Technology Is Steadfast: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite an uncertain outlook, corporations plan to continue investing in their digital projects -- a source of stability for the economy.
Johnson Controls traces its origin to the late 19th century in Wisconsin, where a clever teacher and inventor named Warren Johnson designed an early thermostat to turn the heat on or off in his classroom.
Today, Johnson Controls is an international corporation and, like companies in every industry, increasingly a technology business. The company's software and sensors monitor and manage heating and cooling equipment, fire alarms, security systems and thermostats -- to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
Despite forecasts of a recession, Johnson Controls is not trimming its digital projects, as it seeks to make essential technology for smart buildings. Last year, the company added 500 software engineers and other technical staff to its team of 2,500 software engineers. It plans to hire 350 more tech workers.
"We have to continue to invest," said Vijay Sankaran, chief technology officer of Johnson Controls. "You can't do what we're trying to do without technology."
In recent interviews and surveys, the same theme was struck again and again. The economic outlook is uncertain. Contingency plans are in place. Some initiatives are being trimmed back or slowed down. But business investment in technology remains remarkably resilient, and that trend appears likely to continue in 2023.
In a recent poll of corporate technology managers in the United States by the research firm IDC, 82 percent said they expected a recession this year. But 62 percent replied that technology spending at their companies would be the same or increase compared with 2022.
The managers who shape technology strategy and spending at companies across the country hold an important swing vote in today's economy. Their confidence could help stabilize the economy, even as consumers cut back and Silicon Valley companies trim their payrolls after a period of explosive growth fueled by the pandemic.
Technology plays a larger role in mainstream corporate operations and accounts for a larger share of business investment than in the last two recessions -- in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst and in the 2007-9 financial crisis.
The big difference is software. Business spending on software, including software developed by companies for their own use, more than doubled over the last decade, to $ 567 billion in 2022, according to an analysis of government data by James Bessen, an economist at the Technology & Policy Research Institute at the Boston University School of Law.
That is 37 percent more than businesses spent on factories and industrial equipment combined.
The role of technology, experts say, has also steadily evolved. It is less an electricity-style utility used to automate back-office tasks and more a key ingredient that contributes to a company's revenue and profits.
In recent years, new technologies like cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity software have become increasingly mainstream. Companies now see them as vital tools for conducting business.
"That's going to be a counterbalance for the economy that didn't exist in the last two downturns," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
At Elevance Health, a big insurer and health services provider, the ever-larger role of information technology is apparent. Eighty percent of the communication contacts with the more than 45 million people the company covers are now through its website, mobile app or online chatbot. Five years ago, about 30 percent were handled on its digital channels.
Elevance, which last year changed its name from Anthem, employs a technology work force that numbers in the tens of thousands, including software engineers, user experience designers, data scientists and A.I. experts.
They work on automating tasks like authorizations for medical procedures and claims adjudication. They are also building the software to deliver personalized recommendations for treatments and health advice to medical professionals and individuals.
That goal, said Rajeev Ronanki, a senior vice president of Elevance, is the company's strategic direction. And it can be achieved only by mining and analyzing the insurer's vast stores of billing and clinical data for insights -- a job for teams of skilled tech workers.
A rocky economy may mean the company has to fine-tune its spending plans, Mr. Ronanki said. "But we're laser-focused on investing in our core priorities, and that won't change much regardless of the economy," he said.
Big Tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta are laying off workers. But that is not true of the broader tech economy.
Most technology workers do not work at tech companies. And while employment in tech occupations did slip slightly last month, by half a percentage point, it was 7 percent higher than in January 2022. Nearly 6.5 million people work in tech jobs in America, 430,000 more than a year ago, according to an analysis of government statistics by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The unemployment rate in tech occupations is 1.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for all workers.
Even the tech giants, after making layoffs, will have significantly more employees than before the pandemic. Most other companies did not go on wild hiring sprees, but had added steadily to their tech work forces.
JPMorgan Chase, the big bank, has a technology staff of 55,000, up from about 50,000 before the pandemic. It has hired people with skills in cloud computing, data science, A.I. and cybersecurity, and the bank will continue to add people selectively, said Lori Beer, the bank's global chief information officer.
Global technology surveys point to the weakness in spending on hardware. After a pandemic surge, sales of personal computers and smartphones for remote work and to consumers have fallen sharply. Two major technology research firms, Gartner and IDC, have lowered their growth forecasts in recent months, citing a continued slump in personal computers, the turbulent economy and a strong dollar.
But business investment, especially in software, remains fairly strong. John-David Lovelock, Gartner's chief forecaster, said spending was growing in every industry he tracks and called that trend "recession-proof." His counterpart at IDC, Stephen Minton, said business investment in technology was not immune to a downturn but was "more resilient than it's ever been."
Sales of remote cloud computing and software may be slowing, but only from the stratospheric heights of the pandemic. Amazon reported this month that its highly profitable cloud business, Amazon Web Services, the industry leader, was generating revenue at an annual rate of more than $ 80 billion and had grown 20 percent in the fourth quarter. Microsoft, the second-largest cloud company, reported that sales of Azure, its flagship cloud product, had grown 31 percent.
The recent results for technology suppliers to business show a similar pattern. Suppliers focused on helping companies convert to digital operations and cloud computing are doing well, including Accenture, Oracle and ServiceNow. IBM announced job cuts but for businesses it is shedding; its cloud and A.I. sales are strong.
Salesforce, a maker of customer-management software, is cutting jobs and is a target of activist shareholders. But their argument is that Salesforce should reduce expenses to increase profits. The company's revenue grew 14 percent in the most recent quarter.
The relentless advance of software in nearly every industry makes tech spending less cyclical.
Take the car business. A modern automobile is becoming "a vehicle that is really defined by software," said Alan Wexler, a senior vice president for innovation and growth at General Motors.
A sizable portion of the $ 35 billion that G.M. plans to invest in electric and self-driving cars and trucks through 2025 will be spent on software. The code will not only animate the cars, but also transmit entertainment, office-style communications services and automated driving upgrades to vehicles, as they increasingly navigate on their own.
BrightDrop, a G.M. start-up that makes electric cargo vans, relies on software to plan routes, conserve energy and optimize package stacking in its electric delivery pallets. FedEx recently placed an order for 2,000 BrightDrop vans, and Walmart has reserved 5,000.
When G.M. last month announced record profits, the company also said it planned to trim expenses by $ 2 billion over the next two years. It is a prudent step in an uncertain economy, its executives said.
"But we're not slowing down with these software-led growth businesses," Mr. Wexler said.

Chatbots Are Not Sentient. Here's How They Work.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: No, chatbots aren't sentient. Here's how their underlying technology works.
Microsoft released a new version of its Bing search engine last week, and unlike an ordinary search engine it includes a chatbot that can answer questions in clear, concise prose.
Since then, people have noticed that some of what the Bing chatbot generates is inaccurate, misleading and downright weird, prompting fears that it has become sentient, or aware of the world around it.
That's not the case. And to understand why, it's important to know how chatbots really work.
Is the chatbot alive?
No. Let's say that again: No!
In June, a Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, claimed that similar chatbot technology being tested inside Google was sentient. That's false. Chatbots are not conscious and are not intelligent -- at least not in the way humans are intelligent.
Why does it seem alive then?
Let's step back. The Bing chatbot is powered by a kind of artificial intelligence called a neural network. That may sound like a computerized brain, but the term is misleading.
A neural network is just a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. As a neural network examines thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.
Most people use neural networks every day. It's the technology that identifies people, pets and other objects in images posted to internet services like Google Photos. It allows Siri and Alexa, the talking voice assistants from Apple and Amazon, to recognize the words you speak. And it's what translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate.
Neural networks are very good at mimicking the way humans use language. And that can mislead us into thinking the technology is more powerful than it really is.
How exactly do neural networks mimic human language?
About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI, a San Francisco start-up that recently released the popular ChatGPT chatbot, began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and all sorts of other stuff posted to the internet.
These neural networks are known as large language models. They are able to use those mounds of data to build what you might call a mathematical map of human language. Using this map, the neural networks can perform many different tasks, like writing their own tweets, composing speeches, generating computer programs and, yes, having a conversation.
These large language models have proved useful. Microsoft offers a tool, Copilot, which is built on a large language model and can suggest the next line of code as computer programmers build software apps, in much the way that autocomplete tools suggest the next word as you type texts or emails.
Other companies offer similar technology that can generate marketing materials, emails and other text. This kind of technology is also known as generative A.I.
Now companies are rolling out versions of this that you can chat with?
Exactly. In November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, the first time that the general public got a taste of this. People were amazed -- and rightly so.
These chatbots do not chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. They can also write term papers and poetry and riff on almost any subject thrown their way.
Why do they get stuff wrong?
Because they learn from the internet. Think about how much misinformation and other garbage is on the web.
These systems also don't repeat what is on the internet word for word. Drawing on what they have learned, they produce new text on their own, in what A.I. researchers call a "hallucination."
This is why the chatbots may give you different answers if you ask the same question twice. They will say anything, whether it is based on reality or not.
If chatbots 'hallucinate,' doesn't that make them sentient?
A.I. researchers love to use terms that make these systems seem human. But hallucinate is just a catchy term for "they make stuff up."
That sounds creepy and dangerous, but it does not mean the technology is somehow alive or aware of its surroundings. It is just generating text using patterns that it found on the internet. In many cases, it mixes and matches patterns in surprising and disturbing ways. But it is not aware of what it is doing. It cannot reason like humans can.
Can't companies stop the chatbots from acting strange?
They are trying.
With ChatGPT, OpenAI tried controlling the technology's behavior. As a small group of people privately tested the system, OpenAI asked them to rate its responses. Were they useful? Were they truthful? Then OpenAI used these ratings to hone the system and more carefully define what it would and would not do.
But such techniques are not perfect. Scientists today do not know how to build systems that are completely truthful. They can limit the inaccuracies and the weirdness, but they can't stop them. One of the ways to rein in the odd behaviors is keeping the chats short.
But chatbots will still spew things that are not true. And as other companies begin deploying these kinds of bots, not everyone will be good about controlling what they can and cannot do.
The bottom line: Don't believe everything a chatbot tells you.

Can a Neighbor's Video Doorbell Zero In on My Apartment's Door?: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Ubiquitous in many suburban neighborhoods, the devices have been slow to catch on in city apartments, but that is changing as New Yorkers warm to the technology.
Q: I live in a small co-op building with just a few apartments per floor. My neighbor recently set up a video doorbell. If it's anything like the ones I have seen on suburban houses, it either shows live video constantly, or is motion triggered. In either scenario, I am being watched as I come and go from my apartment; perhaps even listened to. This is uncomfortable for me. Are these video doorbells allowed in New York City apartments? Does the board have the ability to ban them?
A: New York City does not have a law prohibiting residents from installing doorbell cameras in apartment building hallways. But your co-op has rules, and a shareholder cannot simply place a video doorbell in a common area.
"If you're living in a co-op, you can't just unilaterally do what you'd like to do in the common hallways," said Debra J. Guzov, a Manhattan lawyer who represents co-op and condo boards. "It's done with the permission of the board."
Doorbell cameras have become ubiquitous in suburban homes, capturing video of Amazon deliveries, the porch pirates who snatch them and anyone else who happens to cross the camera's path. The devices have been slower to catch on in city apartments, but that is changing as New Yorkers warm to the technology.
Over the past two years, Ms. Guzov said she has seen the issue come up more frequently, forcing condo and co-op boards to draft policies to address it. How buildings move forward depends somewhat on the sentiment of the residents, and how willing a board is to take the sentiment of its community into consideration. While some New Yorkers appreciate what they see as an added layer of security, others bristle at the loss of privacy.
"It creeps a lot of us out," said Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and the author of "I Have Nothing to Hide," a book about surveillance and privacy.
Yes, a hallway is technically a public area, but it's not as heavily trafficked as, say, the lobby or the sidewalk. "We as New Yorkers, we don't want our neighbors recording our comings and goings 24-7," said Ms. Boghosian who is a member of her Manhattan co-op board and would like to see her own board consider such a policy.
Call your managing agent and find out if the building has a rule about doorbell cameras and whether the camera complies with it. Depending on what you learn, the co-op board may need to be made aware of your neighbor's bell. If no policy exists, now is probably the time for the co-op board to draft one, taking the concerns of residents into consideration. Ms. Guzov said some co-ops add restrictions about how a camera is angled, or whether anything can be recorded, and if so, how long the material can be stored.
You should also talk to your neighbor. Knock on the door, introduce yourself and politely explain your concerns. Ask if the camera could be removed, if its recording feature could be shut off, or, at the very least, if it could be directed away from your apartment door. Your neighbor might not realize that this bothers you at all, and might be willing to accommodate your request. But if they brush you off, which is certainly possible, you can lobby the board for a policy that protects your privacy.

Ex-Church Committee Aides Send Jordan an Open Letter: [National Desk]

Full text: Staff members from the panel viewed as the gold standard of congressional inquiry advised the top Republican to pursue a bipartisan inquiry and operate in good faith with Democrats.
As the new Republican-led panel tasked with investigating the weaponization of government continued to issue new subpoenas this week, those who orchestrated the inquiry that its leaders have claimed as a model are warning the chairman against allowing his work to veer into partisan territory.
More than two dozen staff members from the panel formed in the 1970s that came to be known as the Church Committee sent an open letter on Wednesday to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and its powerful new subcommittee. They offered advice for how he could follow in the footsteps of their panel, which uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses under presidents of both parties and set the gold standard in Congress for scrutinizing the executive branch.
The counsel is simple: Pursue a bipartisan inquiry, follow the facts, do not try to interfere with open investigations and operate in good faith.
The Church Committee, formed in 1975 and commonly known by the name of its chairman, Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, was formally called the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities. It investigated warrantless electronic surveillance affecting U.S. citizens; C.I.A. assassination plots against foreign leaders; C.I.A. and F.B.I. mail-opening programs; C.I.A. drug testing on unwitting governmental personnel; communications intercepts affecting Americans; and the disruption and discrediting of peaceful civil rights and antiwar activists.
It is regarded by members of both parties as the paragon of a bipartisan and productive congressional inquiry.
Mr. Jordan's panel, by contrast, has begun amid partisan strife. Democrats have objected even to the creation of the committee and its goals, and Republicans have made clear that their aim is to focus on one side of the partisan ledger, seeking evidence that the federal government is biased against conservatives and the right. The formation of a "Church-style committee" was a top demand of a band of right-wing Republicans who resisted electing Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, and its inaugural hearing last week relitigated a litany of old grievances about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others.
"If they're sincere about emulating the Church Committee model, then we wanted the particulars to be laid out there clearly so that everyone has guideposts to measure the extent to which Jordan is succeeding or failing and living up to the legacy of the Church Committee," Frederick D. Baron, a former associate deputy attorney general who was a lawyer for the Church Committee, said of the letter.
Paul Michel, a former federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan who served as a Republican aide on the Church Committee, said many lines of inquiry the panel had pursued did not pan out.
"There were a lot of hints of some very bad conduct, but when we pursued all the documents and the witnesses, some of it turned out to be quite innocent," he recalled. "So if the Jordan committee is evenhanded factually, they'll do a good job and it'll be credible. But if they pursue what some people might call conspiracy theories, and only look at things that seem to support that, it will eventually be viewed as not credible."
A spokesman for the panel declined to comment.
The letter comes as the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government has begun issuing subpoenas, seeking documents for an investigation into whether the government mistreated parents who were scrutinized after school officials endured threats and harassment over mask mandates and teaching about racism.
On Wednesday, Mr. Jordan issued more subpoenas, this time to the technology companies Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft for documents and communications relating to whether they had worked with the federal government to block certain Americans from communicating through their platforms -- something Mr. Jordan calls "censorship by proxy."
The subpoenas require the chief executives of those companies, Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella, to turn over all requested documents and communications by March 23.
The committee did not issue a subpoena to Twitter or its owner, Elon Musk, who has at times aligned himself with the right, urging voters last fall to elect Republicans and saying he would welcome Mr. Trump back to his platform.
In the letters, the panel said such an action was unnecessary because Twitter "recently set a benchmark for how transparent Big Tech companies can be about interactions with government over censorship." The committee cited the release of the so-called Twitter Files, which showed how the company restricted some tweets after receiving requests to do so from government officials.
The House Judiciary Committee said it has been working to get documents from the companies since December, when Republicans were in the minority, without success.
"Your response without compulsory process has been woefully inadequate," Mr. Jordan wrote to the executives.
On Thursday, Mr. Jordan sent a letter to Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, demanding answers about what he called the bureau's "targeting of a set of Catholic Americans for their religious beliefs." At issue is a Jan. 23 memo from the F.B.I.'s Richmond field office that linked "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists" with a "radical traditionalist Catholic" ideology, prompting outrage from Catholic groups and Republican attorneys general. The F.B.I. headquarters in Washington has since disavowed the document and blamed the field office for its creation.
The letter requires Mr. Wray to produce documents about the memo by March 2.
At the weaponization committee's first hearing, Democrats fought against the panel's very premise and argued that Mr. Jordan had not given agencies enough time to respond to him before issuing subpoenas.
Church Committee staff members recalled a different era on Capitol Hill, when Republicans and Democrats worked closely together and "to an extent that my students can hardly even imagine," said Gregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council who was a Democratic staff member on the panel.
"On the Church Committee, there was broad agreement that these things ought to be looked at and, in the end, there was broad agreement on what we might do about them," he said. "In this case, there's no broad agreement on what ought to be looked at."

Full text: Climate change didn't make the dry spell more likely, researchers found, though extreme heat probably made it hurt more.
Lack of rainfall that caused severe drought in Argentina and Uruguay last year was not made more likely by climate change, scientists said Thursday. But global warming was a factor in extreme heat experienced in both countries that made the drought worse, they said.
The researchers, part of a loose-knit group called World Weather Attribution that studies recent extreme weather for signs of the influence of climate change, said that the rainfall shortage was a result of natural climate variability.
Specifically, they said, the presence of La Niña, a climate pattern linked to below-normal sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific that influences weather around the world, most likely affected precipitation.
La Niña usually occurs once every three to five years, often alternating with El Niño, which is linked to above-normal sea temperatures. But La Niña conditions have persisted for most of the past three years, and central South America has been drier than normal for most of that time.
In the last three months of 2022, however, the drought became especially severe. Rainfall totals in central Argentina were the lowest in more than half a century, and yields of wheat, soybeans and other crops fell dramatically in prime growing regions there and in Uruguay. Water emergencies were declared in some areas.
Like previous studies by the group, this one used observational data and computer models to compare what occurred late last year with what would have likely occurred in a world that had not warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius, or 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit, as a result of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. The work has not yet been peer reviewed, but the techniques the researchers used have been peer reviewed in previous studies.
The analysis looked at rainfall totals for October to December over most of Argentina, all of Uruguay and a small part of southern Brazil. They found that without climate change there was a 5 percent chance that such a period of sharply lower rainfall would occur in any given year.
But climate change did not increase the chances, they found. If anything, climate models show that region of central South America becoming slightly wetter as warming continues, though the researchers said the effect was insignificant and, as appeared to be the case with this drought, could be overwhelmed by natural variability.
The area also experienced record-setting heat waves last November and December. Extreme heat can make droughts worse by increasing the loss of moisture from soil and plants, said Juan Rivera, a researcher at the Argentine Institute for Snow Research, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences, who worked on the study.
In an earlier analysis, World Weather Attribution found a link between climate change and the December heat wave, saying that it was about 60 times more likely to occur than it would have been in a world that had not warmed.
Paola A. Arias, a researcher at the University of Antioquia in Colombia who contributed to the study, said that other factors, including deforestation, could also have worsened the dry conditions.
Large-scale clearing of forests reduces atmospheric moisture, Dr. Arias said, and Argentina and Uruguay receive much of their moisture from the southern Amazon, where extensive deforestation has occurred.
World Weather Attribution has conducted several dozen studies of droughts, heat waves, floods and other extreme weather events since 2014, and most of them show some influence of global warming.
Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London who co-founded the group, said that the new research shows "that not every bad thing that is happening now is happening because of climate change."
"It's important to show what the realistic impacts of climate change are," she said.

Labor Secretary Will Leave to Run N.H.L. Players Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Martin J. Walsh, a former mayor of Boston, was regarded as an unusually visible labor secretary.
Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh is leaving the Biden administration to become executive director of the National Hockey League Players' Association, the union announced on Thursday.
Mr. Walsh, a former Boston mayor who had led the city's powerful Building and Construction Trades Council, helped to bolster the Biden administration's pro-union credentials and usher in a period of more aggressive workplace regulation after the relatively hands-off approach during the Trump administration.
Mr. Walsh said in a statement that he would leave the Labor Department in mid-March.
Alongside President Biden, who has been more vocal about supporting unions than any other president in decades, Mr. Walsh was arguably the administration's most visible proponent of unions. He joined Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in meeting union organizers at the White House, and he served as vice chairman of an administration task force exploring how the federal government could increase union membership.
Although union membership fell to 10.1 percent of the work force last year, the lowest rate on record, the country added nearly 300,000 union members amid a wave of worker organizing at major corporations including Starbucks, Amazon and Apple. (The rate fell because the work force grew even more rapidly.) Mr. Walsh cheered on the trend and warned employers to respect workers' desire to unionize and refrain from coercive tactics.
"As secretary of labor, I don't appreciate that," he said in an interview in August, when asked about complaints issued against Starbucks by the National Labor Relations Board. Workers who choose to organize "should be treated fairly and respectfully, not intimidated," he added. Starbucks has denied violating labor law.
In the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate and health bill that Mr. Biden signed last year, Mr. Walsh helped push for labor-friendly provisions, including incentives for the owners of clean energy projects to pay wages similar to union rates.
When it came to regulation, Mr. Walsh's approach was most visible in the Labor Department's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, an agency within the department, had declined to issue a new workplace rule governing Covid-19 under President Donald J. Trump.
But Mr. Biden and Mr. Walsh pushed the agency to issue two so-called emergency standards -- one outlining the steps employers in the health care industry would have to take to protect workers, and another requiring workers to either be vaccinated against the coronavirus or wear masks and be tested regularly. The Supreme Court blocked the latter rule, though it let stand a provision from another agency that required workers to be vaccinated at facilities that received funding from Medicare and Medicaid.
After an executive order from Mr. Biden, the Labor Department also put forth a rule raising the minimum wage for federal contractors last year to $ 15 an hour. It proposed a rule that would make it more likely for millions of workers in industries like home care, construction and gig work to be classified as employees rather than independent contractors, guaranteeing them a minimum wage and overtime pay, and another that could raise the wages paid to construction workers on federally funded projects.
It has recently cited six Amazon warehouses for creating work environments that have high risk for musculoskeletal injuries among workers. Amazon has said the accusations don't reflect the steps it takes to ensure worker safety.
Ann Rosenthal, a longtime Labor Department lawyer who was at the department during the first year of the Biden administration, said Mr. Walsh was among the most effective of the 13 secretaries she served because of his credibility with unions and other worker advocates, his close relationship with Mr. Biden, and his political instincts and pragmatism. "He really checked all the boxes," Ms. Rosenthal said.
Mr. Walsh's tenure at the department was not without controversy. Most prominent was the deal he helped broker in September between major freight rail carriers and a dozen unions representing more than 100,000 rail workers. The deal helped to avert a potentially crippling strike before the midterm elections and granted improvements in health benefits and wage increases of nearly 25 percent over five years.
But the deal lacked paid sick days, and some workers complained that it did little to ease the grueling, unpredictable schedules that had put stress on their personal lives and health. Although members of four rail unions voted down the deal, the administration urged Congress to mandate the deal in November, and the president signed legislation enacting it. (Last week, one of the carriers, CSX, announced an agreement with unions that would provide four paid sick days a year for about 5,000 workers; a White House spokeswoman said Mr. Walsh had continued to push the rail carriers to offer paid sick leave.)
Critics also complained that OSHA under Mr. Walsh didn't go far enough in protecting workers from Covid-19. They said the agency should have devised regulations that applied to a variety of high-risk industries, such as meat processing, grocery and retail, not just health care. (The department said it had the power to ensure worker safety in these industries through other means, such as a so-called general duty clause.)
Other rules, like the independent contractor rule and the one governing construction-worker wages, were proposed but not finalized during the first two years of the Biden administration -- a delay that has worried some supporters.
And Mr. Walsh and his administration colleagues failed in their efforts to win legislation that would have made it easier for workers to unionize, such as the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which would have blocked employers from requiring workers to attend anti-union meetings and made it possible to impose penalties on employers that violated labor law. The House passed the measure, but it stalled in the Senate.
The Senate also killed a measure that would have granted consumers a $ 4,500 incentive to buy electric vehicles assembled at unionized plants in the country.
A battery plant in Ohio that is a joint venture of General Motors and the South Korean manufacturer LG Energy Solution recently unionized. But without the kind of legislation that the Senate has balked at, unions face much longer odds in organizing at a proliferation of new battery and electric vehicle plants in the South.
Mr. Walsh is a longtime fan of the Boston Bruins and has received political contributions from the hockey team's owner. The Daily Faceoff, a hockey publication, previously reported on the contributions.
The New York Times reported last month that Mr. Walsh was one of several candidates under consideration to replace Ron Klain as Mr. Biden's chief of staff. That job eventually went to Jeffrey D. Zients.

Tesla Fired Buffalo Workers Seeking to Organize, Union Says

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Barely 24 hours after a group of software workers at a Tesla factory here issued a letter declaring their intention to unionize, firings began. And the organizers said it was not a coincidence.
In a filing to the National Labor Relations Board, organizers said at least 18 employees were dismissed Wednesday “in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity.” Tesla workers involved in the union campaign said Thursday that the number had grown to 37.
The workers said in interviews that most of those let go had not been involved in the campaign. Typically, Tesla fires a small number of workers in March after performance reviews, they said — but they had never seen so many dismissed at once.
“It’s very suspect that all of this started to happen the day after the letter was sent to the company,” Arian Berek, a data annotation specialist involved in the Buffalo organizing committee, said in an interview. She was laid off Wednesday.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been blunt in his opposition to unions, and the company has a reputation for using hardball tactics against union organizers.
It is illegal for a company to fire workers for so-called protected concerted activity such as seeking to unionize. The Rochester, New York, branch of the Workers United union, in its filing, said the firings were unlawful and asked the labor relations board to seek a court order reinstating the workers with back pay.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The Buffalo plant makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla’s website. It has about 2,000 workers, including 800 who help develop driver-assistance software. The workers pushing for a union are seeking more pay at the factory, where wages start at about $19 an hour.
Some said they were also motivated by perceived insensitivity from Tesla management. For example, they said, they were required to take sick days in December when catastrophic snowstorms in Buffalo prevented many people from getting to work.
Berek said she had become involved in the union because of increasing demands by management and more stringent tracking of employee activities. “It’s gotten very militant over the last few months,” she said. “If you have to go to the bathroom or have some kind of emergency, you can get penalized.”
She had returned Monday from a two-week bout with COVID-19 and bereavement leave because of a relative’s death. Company representatives told her that she had been dismissed as part of a drive to accelerate company performance, and also cited absenteeism, Berek said. They said it had nothing to do with her involvement in the union, she added.
Jaz Brisack, an organizer with Workers United who has been involved in the campaign, said in an interview Tuesday that workers had decided to go public with their organizing effort partly to make it easier for them to communicate.
Brisack, who was an early leader of the Starbucks union campaign, said that many of the Tesla workers had complained of being closely monitored at their computers and that being public would give them more freedom to have conversations about the union campaign.
The movement began among the software workers, who are trying to win support from co-workers in manufacturing. There is normally little interaction among employees for the different operations, workers said, because they occupy different spaces. They also take breaks at different times.
On Tuesday, after several months of organizing quietly, the pro-union workers went public and began distributing leaflets outside the plant, as well as sending a letter to management.
The labor dispute could complicate Tesla’s relationship with President Joe Biden, who Wednesday praised the company’s decision to open up a portion of its charging network to owners of other electric vehicles.
The move seemed to represent an improvement in the relationship between Biden and Musk, who had complained that the administration paid insufficient attention to Tesla during its push for electric vehicle subsidies.
But Biden has also cast himself as a strong defender of unions. A White House spokesperson said in a statement Thursday that “the president supports fundamental rights for workers under the National Labor Relations Act, including the right to organize free from intimidation and coercion.”
Companies run by Musk have been accused in the past of illegally firing employees involved in organizing efforts. But adjudication of employment law can be slow and inefficient.
In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company’s car factory in Fremont, California, more than three years earlier, and that Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
The board ordered Tesla to reinstate the worker with back pay and ordered Musk to delete a Twitter post making the implied threat. The post appears to still be active as the company appeals the ruling in federal court.
Last year, SpaceX, the rocket manufacturer that Musk started, fired at least eight employees after they helped to write a letter to management urging the company to distance itself from Musk’s sometimes inflammatory statements on Twitter and to better enforce the company’s policies on sexual harassment and discrimination.
The employees filed charges of unfair labor practices with the labor board in November; the cases are pending.
After employees file a charge, a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board must investigate. If the regional office finds merit in the accusation, it will give the company a chance to settle the charge and will issue a complaint in the absence of a settlement. The complaint is then litigated before an administrative judge, whose ruling can be appealed to the labor board in Washington, then to federal court.
The process can take years, but the labor board can ask a federal judge to issue an injunction reinstating the workers as the case runs its course. Although the board has sometimes been reluctant to use this approach, Jennifer Abruzzo, the agency’s general counsel, issued a memo last year instructing regional offices to make it a more common practice.
Companies facing high-profile union efforts, such as Amazon and Starbucks, have disciplined and fired workers involved in organizing over the past few years. Both companies have denied violating labor law and say they have taken the steps as a response to violations of company policies.
“The only reason not to do it is if there’s going to be some really meaningful political and economic consequences for breaking the law — if they’re going to face some kind of really severe customer backlash,” said John Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University who is an expert on anti-union campaigns.
But given Musk’s reputation as a hard-charging boss who doesn’t hesitate to fire workers he perceives as disloyal, Tesla’s concerns about a possible backlash may be minimal.
“Tesla clearly doesn’t care about its reputation with liberals when it comes to labor relations,” Sam Abuelsamid, an auto industry analyst at Guidehouse Insights, said in an email. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Microsoft released a new version of its Bing search engine last week, and unlike an ordinary search engine it includes a chatbot that can answer questions in clear, concise prose.
Since then, people have noticed that some of what the Bing chatbot generates is inaccurate, misleading and downright weird, prompting fears that it has become sentient, or aware of the world around it.
That’s not the case. And to understand why, it’s important to know how chatbots really work.
Is the chatbot alive?
No. Let’s say that again: No!
In June, a Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, claimed that similar chatbot technology being tested inside Google was sentient. That’s false. Chatbots are not conscious and are not intelligent — at least not in the way humans are intelligent.
Why does it seem alive then?
Let’s step back. The Bing chatbot is powered by a kind of artificial intelligence called a neural network. That may sound like a computerized brain, but the term is misleading.
A neural network is just a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. As a neural network examines thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.
Most people use neural networks every day. It’s the technology that identifies people, pets and other objects in images posted to internet services like Google Photos. It allows Siri and Alexa, the talking voice assistants from Apple and Amazon, to recognize the words you speak. And it’s what translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate.
Neural networks are very good at mimicking the way humans use language. And that can mislead us into thinking the technology is more powerful than it really is.
How exactly do neural networks mimic human language?
About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI, a San Francisco startup that recently released the popular ChatGPT chatbot, began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and all sorts of other stuff posted to the internet.
These neural networks are known as large language models. They are able to use those mounds of data to build what you might call a mathematical map of human language. Using this map, the neural networks can perform many tasks, like writing their own tweets, composing speeches, generating computer programs and, yes, having a conversation.
These large language models have proved useful. Microsoft offers a tool, Copilot, which is built on a large language model and can suggest the next line of code as computer programmers build software apps, in much the way that autocomplete tools suggest the next word as you type texts or emails.
Other companies offer similar technology that can generate marketing materials, emails and other text. This kind of technology is also known as generative AI.
Now companies are rolling out versions of this that you can chat with?
Exactly. In November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, the first time that the general public got a taste of this. People were amazed — and rightly so.
These chatbots do not chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. They can also write term papers and poetry and riff on almost any subject thrown their way.
Why do they get stuff wrong?
Because they learn from the internet. Think about how much misinformation and other garbage is on the web.
These systems also don’t repeat what is on the internet word for word. Drawing on what they have learned, they produce new text on their own, in what AI researchers call a “hallucination.”
This is why the chatbots may give you different answers if you ask the same question twice. They will say anything, whether it is based on reality or not.
If chatbots ‘hallucinate,’ doesn’t that make them sentient?
AI researchers love to use terms that make these systems seem human. But hallucinate is just a catchy term for “they make stuff up.”
That sounds creepy and dangerous, but it does not mean the technology is somehow alive or aware of its surroundings. It is just generating text using patterns that it found on the internet. In many cases, it mixes and matches patterns in surprising and disturbing ways. But it is not aware of what it is doing. It cannot reason like humans can.
Can’t companies stop the chatbots from acting strange?
They are trying.
With ChatGPT, OpenAI tried controlling the technology’s behavior. As a small group of people privately tested the system, OpenAI asked them to rate its responses. Were they useful? Were they truthful? Then OpenAI used these ratings to hone the system and more carefully define what it would and would not do.
But such techniques are not perfect. Scientists today do not know how to build systems that are completely truthful. They can limit the inaccuracies and the weirdness, but they can’t stop them. One of the ways to rein in the odd behaviors is keeping the chats short.
But chatbots will still spew things that are not true. And as other companies begin deploying these kinds of bots, not everyone will be good about controlling what they can and cannot do.
The bottom line: Don’t believe everything a chatbot tells you. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Netflix Pursues the Games Behind the Games: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Unlike many of its rivals, Netflix has not pursued showing live games. Instead, it has invested in series on professional auto racing, tennis and now golf.
By the fourth season of Netflix's documentary series about Formula 1, "Drive to Survive," the streaming company had plenty of evidence that it was onto something: Ratings and attendance for Grand Prix events, as well as merchandise sales, were surging.
So Netflix executives began discussions with the show's producers: What other sports are out there?
"It really showed us that the ceiling was much higher than we might have thought," said Brandon Riegg, the Netflix vice president of nonfiction series.
On Wednesday, Netflix's latest sports documentary series, "Full Swing," which focuses on men's professional golf, will become available, just weeks after its tennis-focused series, "Break Point," debuted.
For years, Netflix executives have resisted paying for the rights to carry live sports, even as streaming rivals like Amazon, Apple and YouTube have chased them aggressively. Netflix is instead pursuing a more modest strategy, building out a sports lineup focused on telling the stories beyond the leaderboard -- and at a considerably smaller cost than for licensing rights to live games.
It is not clear if "Full Swing" or "Break Point" will come close to matching the impact of "Drive to Survive." Ratings for the Australian Open men's final, which took place a little more than two weeks after "Break Point" was released, hit a decade low.
Nevertheless, Netflix executives are confident in focusing on leagues that haven't "really been covered in an exhaustive way compared to some other sports," Mr. Riegg said. And professional golf and tennis are bursting with enthusiasm at the prospect of gaining access to Netflix's 230 million paying subscribers, and are hopeful of the kind of bump that Formula 1 received from "Drive to Survive."
"It turned people not into just 'What is F1?' but it turned people into actual die-hard fans in the U.S. that would turn it on Sunday morning -- it's on at like 5 a.m.," said Collin Morikawa, the 26-year-old golfer who has won the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship, in an interview at a putting green in Arizona.
For some time, the PGA Tour has been looking to do a documentary series to help raise the sport's profile. In June 2017, tour executives met with Netflix officials to discuss the possibility of a series. Netflix passed at the time because it had not yet figured out its sports strategy and the concept was "too unbaked," Mr. Riegg recalled.
But by the next year, with the debuts of series like "Nailed It!" and "Queer Eye," Netflix began investing heavily in unscripted television. A documentary about Aaron Hernandez, a football player who was convicted of murder, was a hit in early 2020, and "Drive to Survive" became a hit shortly thereafter.
For years, live sports rights have been a topic of near constant debate in Netflix leadership meetings. But even as executives have considered it, they have always settled in the same place: The company's money is better spent elsewhere.
"We're not in the business of live sports rights. We're not in the business of renting," Mr. Riegg said.
Netflix is open to doing documentary series on more popular American sports like football or basketball, Mr. Riegg said. But it would need the access, and the full editorial control, that Formula 1, golf and tennis have given it.
"Whether it's live sports or documentaries or shows or fictional shows about sports, sports resonate with almost everybody in some way, so Netflix knows that," said Chris Wandell, a PGA Tour executive who was central to the negotiations about the documentary series.
Not long after Netflix's cameras began rolling, men's professional golf turned into a soap opera, with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund investing billions of dollars into the rival LIV Golf, a league that drew the defections of several major PGA Tour players, including Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson. Over the last year, there have been lawsuits, as well as heated debates over ethics, greed, power and human rights.
Like "Drive to Survive," the series focuses on behind-the-scenes story lines, and producers gained access to players' locker rooms, homes and private jets. Stars like Mr. Koepka, Mr. Morikawa and Jordan Spieth are featured, as are lower-profile players like Joel Dahmen.
"As soon as they said all of the people from 'Drive to Survive' are coming over and are going to do this, that's immediate credibility," Mr. Dahmen said.
Players and executives said they welcomed an outlet that did not broadcast the sport.
"Netflix's track record is pretty good, and it's the best in this space," said Martin Slumbers, the chief executive of the R&A, the governing body that organizes the British Open. "What is good about them is they are truly a global platform, and I think if we had gone for a streaming that was more just U.S., U.K., I don't think we would have had the impact, and I'm not sure I would be as excited about it."
The series sets out to present golf differently from the "somewhat staid coverage on CBS," Mr. Riegg said, referring to a longtime golf broadcaster.
"People think golf is a gentlemen's sport," Mr. Koepka said in the beginning of the second episode. To disabuse such a notion, he added that competitors "want to step on my throat, and I want to step on theirs."
If some die-hard Formula 1 and tennis fans grouse that the Netflix documentaries better serve newbies, "Full Swing" can be, at times, similarly elementary. The opening episode explains basic scoring rules, including what a bogey is.
"You know how hard it is to explain 'par' in one sentence?" said Chad Mumm, the chief creative officer at Vox Media Studios, which, along with Box to Box, produced "Full Swing." (Box to Box also produced "Drive to Survive" and "Break Point.")
Netflix has not yet committed to a second season of "Full Swing." But at last week's Phoenix Open at T.P.C. Scottsdale, "Full Swing" camera crews were conspicuous.
Even if it does not reach the heights of "Drive to Survive," many players feel that "Full Swing" can only be a boost to the tour.
"If we can just get a fraction of that," Mr. Morikawa said, "we're doing pretty well."

In Reversal, Retail Sales Surge Anew: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Consumer spending jumped in January, which was good news for retailers but could weigh on the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame rapid inflation.
Retail sales surged in January, a sign of the resiliency of consumers as prices continued rising at a rapid pace. It was also good news for companies but a potential worry for the Federal Reserve as it tries to slow the economy to rein in inflation.
U.S. retail sales increased 3 percent in January from the previous month, much higher than the 2 percent increase expected by economists in a Bloomberg survey. That's a reversal from the 1.1 percent decline posted December, and the biggest rise since March 2021.
The data, which can be volatile month to month, is adjusted for seasonality but does not account for price changes, meaning that inflation -- which cooled very slightly in January, but showed signs of stickiness -- contributed at least partly to the monthly jump.
Nearly every retail category saw a lift in sales last month, with car dealerships, furniture sellers and electronics stores recording notable increases. Sales at department stores were up 17.5 percent, a surprising bump given that the postholiday shopping season is usually among the slowest-selling seasons for department stores. Sales at gas stations were flat.
The apparent robustness of shoppers at the beginning of the year could make retailers more optimistic about their businesses in 2023. There have been concerns that consumers could pull back as they contend with rapid price increases and burn through savings, shrinking retailers' profit margins and lowering their sales. But the labor market has remained strong and wage growth solid, keeping cash in people's pockets and helping to power continued spending.
Spending in January may also have been lifted in part by a significant, 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment that started arriving in Social Security checks last month, increasing income for many older Americans.
Executives have noted the sturdy consumer demand.
"Right now, we feel really good about our retailers," David Simon, chief executive of the Simon Property Group, which operates malls across the country, said in an analyst call this month. Mr. Simon said that he regularly asked colleagues about signs of pullback in consumer demand and that "it's not really happened."
Still, some retail chiefs are wary of how much higher prices can go before consumers push back.
"We don't want to raise too much prices to then lower them again, because we have a promise that we've made to the customers that we should deliver the best value for money," Helena Helmersson, the chief executive of H&M, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer, said in a call with analysts last month.
The Fed has raised interest rates aggressively over the past year to try to weigh on consumer and business demand, hoping to cool the economy enough that it forces companies to stop raising prices so much. Central bankers have pushed borrowing costs above 4.5 percent, from near zero a year ago, and have forecast at least a couple of more rate increases in the coming months.
But those adjustments -- the most drastic since the 1980s -- seem like they may have temporarily dimmed strong demand rather than snuffing it out decisively. The housing market has cooled and consumer spending had shown clear signs of pulling back in recent months, but the labor market has remained very strong and some parts of the economy appear to be on the brink of accelerating again.
The retail sales report "suggests that any sign we got late last year that consumer spending was flagging was a bit of a false signal," said Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays. "It suggests that consumers are in pretty good shape here: The Fed's rate hikes haven't done a lot to slow spending."
Mr. Millar said some of the weakness in December sales could have come from cold weather and a holiday shopping season that started earlier because of promotions, including an Amazon sale day in October. Because January's figures constituted a bounceback, they appeared unusually strong.
Other analysts suggested that spending may continue to be shaped by people's response to the pandemic.
"People are back in stores. They're figuring out what the future looks like working from home or hybrid," said Katie Thomas, who leads the Kearney Consumer Institute, a think tank. She added, "We put a lot of stock into assumptions of certain pandemic behaviors that didn't end up being so sticky."
The upshot for the Fed is that spending has retained momentum as a strong labor market supports shoppers, Mr. Millar said, explaining that policymakers may need to do more to wrestle inflation down.
Fed officials themselves have already hinted that they could raise rates higher. John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Tuesday that he foresaw interest rates climbing to a range of 5 to 5.5 percent, a bit above the median projection in the Fed's latest set of forecasts, and added that they could go even higher if inflation proved difficult to slow.
But other economists discounted the latest retail numbers as a one-off blip.
A "good chunk of the January strength" in retail sales was probably linked to unseasonably warm weather and could reverse in the coming months, Kieran Clancy, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note. "That won't stop markets fretting that the economy is impervious to the Fed, but we think that view is just wrong."

Love Is Easy, Rom-Coms Are Arduous: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Mark Chavez thought that it would be so simple. Chavez, a Vancouver-based actor and comic, had seen plenty of romantic comedies. He understood the deep structure of the genre, the various story beats that pushed a couple from meet cute to final clinch.
"I went in feeling a bit overconfident," Chavez said during a recent video call. "I was like, 'This will be easy! Plug and play. Just look at every rom-com!"'
On Valentine's Day, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is releasing "Let's Make a Rom-Com," a podcast featuring Chavez alongside his fellow comedians Ryan Beil and Maddy Kelly. Over eight episodes, the three record themselves as they script an original, feature-length romantic comedy, treating the genre with commitment and sincerity. Or as much sincerity as people who knowingly pitch ideas like "Spybrarian," "1-900 SANTA" and "Love Bermuda Triangle" can muster.
This is the show's second season, following last year's "Let's Make a Sci-Fi," which the CBC estimates has been downloaded more than a quarter of a million times. On that earlier podcast, the creators wrote a pilot for an earnest series called "Progeny," set aboard a generational ship sent to colonize a new world. Devising that script meant acquiring a working knowledge of astrophysics. Writing a romantic comedy, the "Let's Make" team learned, was harder -- in large part because the genre felt exhausted.
"Everything has happened," Chavez sighed. "Everything's been done."
"Let's Make a Rom-Com" arrives at (yet another) fraught moment for romantic comedy. As a film species, it has its origins in the screwball comedies and comedies of manners of the 1930s, reaching its apogee in the 1980s and 1990s, courtesy of the zippy banter of Nora Ephron and the gleaming kitchens of the filmmaker Nancy Meyers.
But for decades, it has been fashionable to announce the death of the romantic comedy. It was sexual liberation that killed it. Or unfeeling studio executives. Or Katherine Heigl. (Heigl, for the record, sees it as the other way around.) Or critics, some of whom have dinged it for its focus on white, straight affluent characters and its reinforcing of traditional gender norms.
When it comes to theatrical releases, audiences no longer show up for rom-coms as they once did. Last year, the box office implosion of "Bros," billed as the first gay rom-com wide-released by a major studio, seemed to sound another death knell, with at least one critic arguing that the genre conventions were the problem. Last year, "Ticket to Paradise," starring two of the world's most bankable stars in George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and "The Lost City," starring Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, were the only rom-coms to crack the top 50 at the box office.
Yet the genre is flourishing on streaming services. In the week before Valentine's Day, three new films were released: "Somebody I Used to Know" on Amazon Prime Video; "Your Place Or Mine" on Netflix; and "At Midnight" on Paramount+. Unlike the skin of the films' leads, the reviews have been less than glowing. ("As phony and flat as a store-bought valentine," read the review of "Your Place or Mine" in The New York Times.) But the demand remains. Another romantic comedy, "You People," was the most streamed film on Netflix during the week beginning Jan. 23.
Despite ratings like these, the romantic comedy, as typically practiced, tends to command less respect than other types of films, and its enjoyment is seen as a niche pleasure and a guilty one, paradoxically less mainstream than an enthusiasm for caped men.
"Why is it only rom-coms that are the guilty pleasures?" Alice Guilluy, a scholar who has studied audience response to romantic comedy, asked in a recent interview. "Why is it that we don't feel guilty about watching superhero films or action films that are conveying the same heterosexual norms?"
Then she answered her own rhetorical questions. "It's because it's women and queer audiences that watch them."
That was true of the "Let's Make" team. Kelly, a devoted student of the genre, was the person who pushed hardest for a season about making a romantic comedy. Beil, by contrast, knew rom-coms only glancingly and Chavez used to discount them.
"I wasn't like, 'I'm too cool for this,' or 'This is dumb,"' he said. But he didn't appreciate how difficult it would be to write one until his hands were on the keyboard.
The difficulty is deceptive. In the podcast's first episode, Kelly lays out the differences between last season and this one. A romantic comedy, she says, "takes place on Earth with human beings and it doesn't take itself too seriously. The fate of the planet isn't usually at stake in a rom-com. The only thing that's at stake is love."
Maybe that makes it sound easy. But love, as most romantic comedy characters will inform you, is challenge enough. And for a genre perceived as touchy-feely and lightweight, romantic comedy demands incredible precision in its execution. If story beats -- the setup, the misunderstanding, the reconciliation -- fail to arrive at the right moment, the film won't feel satisfying. Science fiction typically demands the creation of a new world, whereas in a romantic comedy, the presumed audience knows the world already, sometimes too well.
"Everyone knows about the meet cute. Everyone knows about the grand romantic gesture. Well, actually, not everyone," Kelly said, looking pointedly at Chavez.
"Didn't know," Chavez confirmed.
And it turned out that substantiating a realistic world was often trickier than constructing an imagined one. The team set their script in Chicago, a city in which Chavez lived, briefly, 20 years ago. "We did all this research on what happens in Chicago? What will feel authentic? And what won't?" Chavez sighted. "I would much rather put it in a spaceship."
In space, no one can hear you talk about your feelings. Writing this script, the "Let's Make a Rom-Com" comedians found, demanded more vulnerability. "Discussing how we feel about love and relationships, I find that more difficult," Beil said.
Yet vulnerability is a major selling point of a romantic comedy and it's likely the genre's bid for social good. "The best part of rom coms are the willingness to really seriously engage with questions of intimacy and relationship formation," Maria San Filippo, the editor of "After 'Happily Ever After': Romantic Comedy in the Post-Romantic Age."
Is the genre fluffy? Sure. But only if you consider how and with whom people choose to spend their lives less substantive than your average car chase.
And hand-wringing about the genre's durability and box office reach feels miserly when the rom-com has finally opened itself more fully to queer characters, racially diverse characters, characters who can't (always) support a cashmere habit.
"Fire Island," which debuted last year on Hulu, has almost nothing in common with the traditional rom-com, despite its debt to Jane Austen. Its protagonists are gay Asian American men, its kitchen is merely adequate. Which is to say that for every criticism that has been leveled at the romantic comedy, there are artists -- particularly queer artists and artists of color who have given us films like "Fire Island," "The Half of It" and "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" -- who can answer it.
For Kelly, the genre's typical conservatism made writing a romantic comedy a little easier. "Rom-coms have been so problematic for so long, there's a lot of stuff that does feel fresh from just not doing that," she said. Kelly identifies as mixed race and she envisioned her protagonists that way, too. This wasn't a big change: It's incidental to the story, not central. But it felt like enough.
"Obvious things are there for the picking, because the genre has been so one-note," she said. As Kelly suggests, there are other notes to play, at least enough for a decent ballad to run under the credits, or maybe a karaoke scene. So maybe the rom-com doesn't need rescuing via some grand romantic gesture in the rain or the run to the airport, maybe it just needs what most relationships need: time, care, compassion, a few jokes.
Is all that effort worth it? Beil, a convert, thinks so. "Sometimes we just want to watch something that makes us feel good," he said.

Tesla Workers at a Factory in Buffalo Begin a Campaign to Form a Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: If successful, the workers who help develop Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance system will be the first group at the company to organize.
A group of workers at a Tesla factory in Buffalo began a campaign on Tuesday to form a union, saying they want better pay and benefits. If successful, the effort could establish the first union at the fast-growing auto and energy company, which has fiercely resisted efforts to organize its employees.
The factory in Buffalo makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla's website, and also has about 800 workers who help develop driver-assistance software for cars. The software workers initiated the union drive, and went public Tuesday in an effort to win broader support at the site.
Tesla pays workers in Buffalo less than national averages and they receive little sick time, workers involved in the drive said. "We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build," Keenan Lasch, a member of a group calling itself Tesla Workers United, said in a statement.
The employees are working with Workers United, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. The union campaign was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Attempts to organize Tesla workers have so far failed. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has been openly hostile to unions. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company's car factory in Fremont, Calif., and that Mr. Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The company's nonunion workplaces potentially give the company a cost advantage over established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, whose employees are represented by the United Auto Workers in the United States. Unionized workers generally receive better pay and benefits than workers who are not represented.
The U.A.W. has so far been frustrated in its attempts to expand beyond the Michigan automakers. In recent years, attempts to organize workers for foreign automakers with factories in the South, including Nissan, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, have failed.
Tesla is the latest big technology company to be the target of labor organizers. Amazon workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted in April to unionize, but workers at an Amazon facility in Albany, N.Y., voted in October against union representation.
The drive in Buffalo has the support of Jaz Brisack, who gained national prominence for her efforts to organize Starbucks workers in Buffalo.
"So incredibly glad to be working with the Tesla workers on their campaign!" Ms. Brisack said on Twitter on Tuesday.
The Autopilot workers in Buffalo analyze data collected by cars to improve the software, which has been blamed for numerous crashes, some fatal. Federal officials have asked Tesla for documents related to the self-driving software, the company disclosed last month.
Tesla has openings for jobs in Buffalo that entail labeling images and videos collected from cars. No experience in artificial intelligence or data labeling is required, according to two job postings on its website.
Workers said they were committed to Tesla's mission but wanted a greater voice. In an open letter to fellow workers, they said they wanted to form a union that would "be as innovative as the company we work for and to build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company."
"As much as I love my job, it can feel very disheartening living paycheck to paycheck when I work for one of the most successful companies in the world," Zahra Lahrache, who has worked at Tesla in Buffalo for five months, said in a statement issued by the workers, "and that is why I am exercising my right to unionize."

G.O.P. Critic of F.T.C. Chair Quits Over 'Abuse of Power': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Christine Wilson, the sole Republican commissioner at the F.T.C., criticized Lina Khan, the Democratic chair of the agency, accusing her of an "abuse of power."
WASHINGTON -- Christine Wilson, the sole Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, said on Tuesday that she would soon resign and criticized Lina Khan, the Democratic chair of the agency, accusing her of an "abuse of power."
Ms. Wilson, who announced her decision in an opinion essay in The Wall Street Journal, has been a consistent critic of Ms. Khan's leadership. Ms. Khan, who became chair of the F.T.C. in June 2021, immediately set out to aggressively transform the agency into a bulwark against tech mergers and monopolies and a more powerful regulator of online privacy.
Ms. Wilson and another former Republican member of the F.T.C., Noah Phillips, who resigned in October, have repeatedly expressed concerns that Ms. Khan's ambitions exceeded the legal authority of the agency, which enforces consumer protection and competition laws.
In particular, Ms. Wilson criticized a lawsuit that the F.T.C. filed in July to block Meta's merger with a virtual reality app maker, Within, as well as a decision last month to ban "noncompete" clauses in employment contracts that limit the options of employees while locking in the power of companies to retain workers.
Ms. Wilson is a longtime antitrust lawyer, and was nominated to the F.T.C. by President Donald J. Trump in 2018. The F.T.C. has five commissioners.
"My fundamental concern with her leadership of the commission pertains to her willful disregard of congressionally imposed limits on agency jurisdiction, her defiance of legal precedent and her abuse of power to achieve desired outcomes," Ms. Wilson wrote of Ms. Khan.
Ms. Khan said in a joint statement with two Democratic F.T.C. commissioners, Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, "While we often disagreed with Commissioner Wilson, we respect her devotion to her beliefs and are grateful for her public service."
Ms. Wilson's departure is expected to put greater political pressure on the agency, which Republican lawmakers and businesses have criticized for being too tough on companies. Congress controls the budgets of agencies and can threaten to curtail the F.T.C.'s powers via its power over funding. It can also call Ms. Khan to appear in public oversight hearings.
Ms. Khan has defended her actions, saying the agency's permissive approach to mergers over decades had allowed companies like Google, Meta and Amazon to balloon in size and eat up competition. She has pushed the agency to take on riskier cases that it may not even win.
President Biden nominated Ms. Khan to lead the F.T.C. as part of a group of progressive antitrust reformers who included Tim Wu at the White House and Jonathan Kanter, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department. Ms. Khan is overseeing lawsuits against Meta and a suit to block Microsoft's merger with Activision.
Ms. Khan, 33, rose to fame in 2017 when she published a paper in the Yale Law Journal about Amazon, questioning decades-long views about illegal monopolization and the ways that antitrust laws were being applied to tech companies. She continued gaining attention with her participation in a congressional report in 2020 that called for the breakup for tech monopolies.
Ms. Wilson and companies like Meta and Amazon have called for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from investigations and cases involving them. They said that given Ms. Khan's early opinions about the companies, she could not fairly evaluate cases involving them. Ms. Khan has not removed herself from cases involving Meta and other tech companies.
Ms. Wilson did not announce a date for her departure.

Walmart to Close Three Tech Hubs

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Walmart will close technology hubs in Texas, California and Oregon, and aim to relocate employees from there to other locations, including the company’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.
“We’ve made the decision to focus our tech team’s presence within select locations,” Walmart said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “We hope to relocate or allow for remote work for all affected associates.”
Walmart had been expanding its tech hubs across the United States and Canada over the past few years. It also has hubs in India. In March, it announced that it was opening hubs in Atlanta and Toronto. The hubs it is closing are in Austin, Texas; Carlsbad, California; and Portland, Oregon.
It was not immediately clear how many employees would be affected. News of the closings was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, has been building up its infrastructure over the years so that it can operate more like a tech company. In 2016, it acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion in a bid to further its digital presence and compete against e-commerce giants like Amazon. Jet.com’s founder, Marc Lore, became Walmart’s chief executive of e-commerce. In 2020, Walmart announced that it would discontinue the site and phase out the brand. Lore left the company in 2021.
Walmart’s digital business remains strong. In its most recent earnings, which it released in November, the retailer reported that e-commerce increased 1% from the previous year — and 38% from 2020. The company will report fourth-quarter earnings next Tuesday.
The closing of the tech hubs is also part of a trend in which large companies are calling workers back to headquarters. The push-and-pull between remote work and the return to office has been playing out for nearly two years, and some companies want employees closer at hand.
“The unique culture and values of Walmart are at the core of who we are,” the company said in its statement.
Walmart has been building a state-of-the-art office in Bentonville. The plans that it has revealed so far resemble tech company campuses in Silicon Valley, with services like child care and bicycles for employees. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Season Is Over, But the Story Lines Are Never Ending: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The Tom Brady era has ended as younger players like Patrick Mahomes make their mark, while injuries, diversity and other issues intensify.
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- The N.F.L. strives to be a 365-day-a-year showcase.
From the Super Bowl to the scouting combine in a few weeks to the start of free agency in March and the draft in April and the preparation for the new season a few months after that, the drumbeat of attraction and attention never seems to stop. With the 2022 season in the books, with a thrilling victory by the Kansas City Chiefs over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl, here are some of the issues that will be the talk of the N.F.L. even before the next season starts on Sept. 7.
The post-Brady, Mahomes era
Assuming Tom Brady really has retired after 23 seasons, Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes will be the most recognizable player in the league. His leading his team to a second-half, comeback win over the Eagles, 38-35, only cements his standing as the next big thing. Like Brady, he has piled up wins -- Kansas City has the most wins in the league since Mahomes became a starter in 2018 -- and his creativity and flair for dramatic plays make him the envy of fans, sponsors and broadcasters.
"A lot of what makes the game as exciting as it is are the dual threat quarterbacks" who can run as well as throw, said Mike Mulvihill, the executive vice president and head of strategy and analytics at Fox Sports, which, like all of the league's broadcast partners, is eager to show Kansas City games. "Mahomes is probably the best representation of that."
The toll of high-profile injuries
Injuries dominated the news last season, particularly to Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who sustained at least two concussions, and to Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest on the field after a routine tackle. Their scary episodes again highlighted the brutality of the sport, and how a lot of N.F.L. players, despite the money made during their careers, can struggle to get help afterward.
Doctors have called on Tagovailoa to stop playing to avoid risking long-term brain damage, and last week, 10 former players sued Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league's disability plan for, they claimed, systematically denying them health benefits.
The league "portrayed this image like, 'we care about the players, we're doing all this stuff for player safety,"' said one of the plaintiffs, Eric Smith, who played for the Jets for seven seasons and now has a host of physical and mental ailments. "And then as soon as you're not on the roster making them any money playing out on the field, they're like, 'OK, we'll give you five years of insurance, now go leave us alone."'
Dearth of Black coaches
At a season-ending news conference last week, Goodell was repeatedly asked about the lack of diversity at the league's highest ranks, including among owners and head coaches. Goodell has promised to do better, but progress in many cases has been incremental at best. There are just three Black head coaches (a fourth, Mike McDaniel of the Dolphins, identifies as biracial) among the 32 teams in a league in which nearly 70 percent of the players are Black.
The league is battling a lawsuit brought by former head coaches of color who have accused the league of discriminatory hiring practices. Rod Graves, the executive director of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which lobbies the N.F.L. to increase diversity, said that the way to get the owners -- the ultimate decision makers -- to promote diversity on their teams is to show that it is good for their bottom lines.
"This is an area that is like a sore on one portion of your body, and we can do more in this area to make the game attractive to everyone who's qualified," Graves said. "We've been around for 104, 105 years, and it is concerning that we're still having these conversations today that we only have a few head coaches rather than many head coaches of color."
More games will be streamed
N.F.L. games remain the most-watched programming on television partly because they are shown primarily on over-the-air networks like CBS and NBC, which starting this year will collectively pay the N.F.L. roughly $ 10 billion a year for the next decade.
But the league knows that younger fans are more likely to stream games over the internet, so it's tiptoeing into the streaming space. Thursday night games were shown exclusively on Amazon last season, and this year, the popular Sunday Ticket package will be on YouTube, which will pay the N.F.L. at least $ 2 billion a year for the rights.
But N.F.L. games won't be disappearing from over-the-air channels anytime soon.
"We feel that for as much as the business is evolving, when it comes to live content and premium sports events, people are finding them on the traditional outlets just as they did 10, 20, 30 years ago," Mulvihill from Fox Sports said.
Will the Washington Commanders be sold?
In November, Daniel Snyder, the embattled owner of the Washington Commanders, said he hired bankers to explore a sale of part or all of the team he has owned since 1999. That came several weeks after Jim Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, said Snyder might have to be removed for sullying the league's reputation.
It is unclear whether Snyder will unload the team, but if he does, it will sell for more than the $ 4.65 billion the Denver Broncos fetched in 2022. Several billionaires have shown interest, but Jeff Bezos, the executive chairman of Amazon and one of the richest men in the world, could easily outbid them, something many league owners would welcome. His name keeps popping up in news reports, but he remains coy about his interest.

GLENDALE, Ariz. — The NFL strives to be a 365-day-a-year showcase.

“This is an area that is like a sore on one portion of your body, and we can do more in this area to make the game attractive to everyone who’s qualified,” Graves said. “We’ve been around for 104, 105 years, and it is concerning that we’re still having these conversations today that we only have a few head coaches rather than many head coaches of color.”
More Games Will Be Streamed
NFL games remain the most-watched programming on television partly because they are shown primarily on over-the-air networks like CBS and NBC, which starting this year will collectively pay the NFL roughly $10 billion a year for the next decade.
But the league knows that younger fans are more likely to stream games over the internet, so it’s tiptoeing into the streaming space. Thursday night games were shown exclusively on Amazon last season, and this year, the popular Sunday Ticket package will be on YouTube, which will pay the NFL at least $2 billion a year for the rights.
But NFL games won’t be disappearing from over-the-air channels anytime soon.
“We feel that for as much as the business is evolving, when it comes to live content and premium sports events, people are finding them on the traditional outlets just as they did 10, 20, 30 years ago,” Mulvihill from Fox Sports said.
Will the Washington Commanders Be Sold?
In November, Daniel Snyder, the embattled owner of the Washington Commanders, said he hired bankers to explore a sale of part or all of the team he has owned since 1999. That came several weeks after Jim Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, said Snyder might have to be removed for sullying the league’s reputation.
It is unclear whether Snyder will unload the team, but if he does, it will sell for more than the $4.65 billion the Denver Broncos fetched in 2022. Several billionaires have shown interest, but Jeff Bezos, executive chair of Amazon and one of the richest men in the world, could easily outbid them, something many league owners would welcome. His name keeps popping up in news reports, but he remains coy about his interest. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Sanders, Career Gadfly, Takes on Powerful Role That Could Be His Last: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In two unsuccessful bids for the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders made no secret of his disdain for billionaires. Now, in what could be his final act in Washington, he has the power to summon them to testify before Congress -- and he has a few corporate executives in his sights.
One is Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, who Mr. Sanders complains "has become a multibillionaire" by developing a coronavirus vaccine with government money. "I think Mr. Bancel should be talking to his advisers about what he might say to the United States Senate," Mr. Sanders warned in an interview.
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Howard Schultz, the on-and-off chief executive of Starbucks, are also on his list. He views them as union busters whose companies have resorted to "really vicious and illegal" tactics to keep workers from organizing. He has already demanded that Mr. Schultz testify at a hearing in March.
Mr. Sanders, independent of Vermont, can put these men on the spot because he is the new chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. The job gives him sweeping jurisdiction over issues that have animated his rise in politics, such as access to health care, the high cost of prescription drugs and workers' rights.
Mr. Sanders, 81, who identifies as a democratic socialist, has said he will not seek the Democratic nomination for president again if President Biden runs for re-election -- a position he reiterated in a recent interview in his Senate office. He is himself up for re-election in 2024 and would not say whether he would run again, which raises the prospect that the next two years in Congress could be his last.
Mr. Sanders is clearly operating on two tracks. Last week, in a move that might surprise critics who view him as unbending, he partnered with a Republican, Senator Mike Braun of Indiana, to call on rail companies to offer seven days of paid sick leave to their workers -- a provision that the Senate defeated last year when it passed legislation to avert a rail strike.
But he also sent a curt letter to Mr. Schultz, giving him until Tuesday to respond confirming his attendance at the hearing. That followed an earlier, angry letter in which Mr. Sanders urged the Starbucks chief to "immediately halt your aggressive and illegal union busting campaign." A Starbucks spokesman said the company was considering the request for Mr. Schultz to testify and was working to "offer clarifying information" about its labor practices.
Former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat who served as majority leader, said that Mr. Sanders could "bring a balance between the progressive and the pragmatic."
"He will be progressive, he will be aspirational, he will continue to fight the fight," Mr. Daschle said. "But at the same time, I believe Bernie Sanders wants to get things done."
The chairmanship is the latest turn in Mr. Sanders's long career in politics, a coda to his rise from a left-wing socialist curiosity to a national figure with respect, power and a devoted fan base. After three decades in Washington, he still manages to cast himself as an outsider. And while he may never ascend to the presidency, there is no question that he has left his mark on national politics, reviving and strengthening the American left.
But Mr. Sanders's national following cuts both ways. He is both a darling of the progressive movement and fodder for conservatives, who are already gleefully caricaturing him.
"Medicare for all, baby!" crowed Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist, referring to Mr. Sanders's signature legislative initiative, a government-run health care program for all Americans. "I guarantee you Bernie Sanders will provide a wonderful target for Republicans to shoot at."
He already has. Mr. Sanders's rise has put him in the ranks of the very wealthy Americans he criticizes, in part thanks to a book he wrote, "Our Revolution," in the wake of his first bid for the presidency. ("If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too," he said in 2019.)
He is about to go on tour to hawk a new book, "It's OK to Be Angry About Capitalism," due out later this month and billed by its publisher as "a progressive takedown of the über-capitalist status quo." Tickets for an upcoming book event at a concert venue in Washington are selling for up to $ 95 on Ticketmaster -- a company that last month was accused of anti-competitive behavior by some of Mr. Sanders's Senate colleagues. His Republican critics are having a field day with that.
"Anyone else see the 'irony' in Bernie Sanders selling tickets for his 'It's Okay to Be Angry About Capitalism' book tour on Ticketmaster?" Representative Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan, wrote on Twitter.
A spokesman for Mr. Sanders said the senator was not involved in selecting the venue or setting ticket prices.
With Republicans running the House and 60 votes needed to pass most bills in the Senate, Mr. Sanders has little hope of pushing major legislation through Congress. He intends to introduce a Medicare for all bill, as he has done in past Congresses, because he feels "it's important to keep that issue out there," as he put it. But he is well aware that it is going nowhere on Capitol Hill.
"We don't have the votes," he said matter-of-factly. "We have no Republican support for it. And I would guess, you know, we have maybe half of Democrats who might support it."
That is Mr. Sanders the realist speaking, in a tone far more practical than the one he has used during his campaign rallies and familiar rants against millionaires and billionaires. But those who watch Mr. Sanders closely know that, while he has never been a master legislator in the mold of former Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a predecessor of his as the health committee chairman, he is able to work across the aisle.
In 2014, as the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Mr. Sanders partnered with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, on a major overhaul of the veterans' health care system -- a measure that the Vermont senator described then as "not the bill that I would have written," but nonetheless "a significant step forward."
A copy of the bill hangs on the wall of his office, alongside a photograph of President Barack Obama signing it, with Mr. Sanders looking over his shoulder and doing something he is not often seen doing in the Capitol: smiling.
Mr. Sanders's activist roots run deep, but after arriving in Washington in 1991 as Vermont's lone member of the House, he quickly learned that being an outsider would only get him so far; he would have to deal with Democrats if he wanted any power. In the Senate, which he joined in 2007, he has worked his way up the ranks. In addition to leading the Veterans' Affairs Committee, he has also served as chairman of the Budget Committee.
No one -- perhaps not even Mr. Sanders himself -- could have predicted then that he would wage two credible runs for the Democratic nomination for president. In the interview, Mr. Sanders brushed aside questions of politics. He wanted to talk policy.
"We spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of other industrialized nations, and yet we have 85 million who are uninsured or underinsured," he said, adding, "So you have a system that is not working."
"It's propped up by the power of the insurance companies, some drug companies," he continued, "and I will do my best to change it."
Mr. Sanders wants to hear from Moderna, he said, about the company's plan to sharply hike the price of its coronavirus vaccine. In a recent letter to Mr. Bancel, he assailed the vaccine maker for "unacceptable corporate greed" and urged the company to reconsider.
A spokesman for Moderna said the company had always "been willing to engage in conversation with government stakeholders" and would continue to do so.
At the hearing in March, Mr. Sanders wants Mr. Schultz to explain why Starbucks has drawn scrutiny from the National Labor Relations Board. The board has been investigating Starbucks for various allegations of misconduct, including that it had illegally denied raises to union employees and had fired seven workers at a store in Memphis for their union-organizing activity. A court later ordered Starbucks to reinstate those workers.
The health committee also has some must-pass legislation on its agenda, including the reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a 2006 law intended to improve public health and medical preparedness for emergencies, including acts of bioterrorism. The law was reauthorized in 2013 and must again be reauthorized this year.
Joel White, a Republican strategist who specializes in health policy, said Mr. Sanders might be more bipartisan than some of his critics expect, adding, "I think Bernie probably wouldn't have become chair of the health committee just to throw bombs."
Two Republicans on the panel, Mr. Braun and Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas, both said in interviews that they thought they might find common ground with Mr. Sanders on matters like lowering the cost of prescription drugs and supporting community health centers.
And Mr. Daschle said Mr. Sanders had a counterpart he could probably work with: Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the top Republican on the committee. A physician who helped found a community health clinic to treat the uninsured, Mr. Cassidy was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict former President Donald J. Trump at his second impeachment trial.
As committee chairman, Mr. Sanders said he intended to "take the show on the road" by having hearings in places other than Washington so he could hear from ordinary Americans, such as older people who have a hard time paying for prescription drugs, working families struggling to pay for child care and students who cannot afford to pay for college.
With the recent retirement of Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat who served for 48 years, Mr. Sanders is finally the senior senator from Vermont. Asked how he felt, he said, "Pretty good." Then, ever combative, he shot back, "How do you feel?"
He said people who wonder about whether he will run again -- and by people, he meant reporters -- should "keep wondering."
Why? "Because I've just told you, and this is very serious," he said, wearing his trademark scowl. "If you think about my record, I take this job seriously. The purpose of elections is to elect people to do work, not to keep talking about elections."

In Praise of Bookstores, a Reader's Refuge: [Editorial Desk]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "The Unlikely Bookstore of My Dreams," by Ezra Klein (column, Jan. 30):
I second Mr. Klein's praise for his -- and my -- lifelong refuge: the bookstore, especially Barnes & Noble, whose survival was one of the few truly good things to come out of the pandemic.
Yes, Amazon carries everything and at lower prices, but there has always been something special about being inside a bookstore -- be it a Barnes & Noble or an independent store -- and taking time to browse the shelves in different departments and hold the books in my hands.
Sometimes I'm in the mood to look at every book in the history section; other times it's baseball or photography or biography. Once in a while, I'll spot a classic novel I've avoided for decades and give it a try.
I confess that I have taken a book off a bookstore's shelf and spent hours in the store reading it from start to finish. Why? As Mr. Klein wrote, what makes a bookstore great is that it's a place not just to buy books, "but to be among them."
And all those books on the half-dozen bookshelves at my home serve as continual reminders to me of all the things that have piqued my interest over the years.
Fred T. RossiScotch Plains, N.J.
To the Editor:
I just finished reading Ezra Klein's earnest effort to nominate Barnes & Noble for sainthood. Doesn't he know about Barnes & Noble's history of devouring small, independent bookstores, that the chain was once the bane of all independent bookstores? (The movie "You've Got Mail" was about such predatory behavior.)
I was the manager of the old and rare books department at a Shakespeare & Company bookstore on the Upper West Side in Manhattan when Barnes & Noble appeared in our neighborhood like a hungry Tyrannosaurus, devouring our store and a couple of others, like the much treasured children's bookstore Eeyore's.
I completely share Mr. Klein's love of brick-and-mortar bookstores (I once owned one myself), but a little bit of corporate and community history would be appreciated.
Mike FederNew York
To the Editor:
Kudos to Ezra Klein for the good news celebrating physical books and bookstores and explaining the resurgence of Barnes & Noble.
During the pandemic some of the independents offered author interviews on Zoom -- a real gift to the homebound. We logged on to Powell's City of Books in Portland, Ore., and met wonderful books unknown to us and had the pleasure of watching an hourlong interview with the authors.
Yes, we pay more for our books at the brick-and-mortar bookstores, but there are many benefits not available from online sources. Long live bookstores!

The Kafka Diaries
To the Editor:
Ross Benjamin happily places himself on the right side of history in "The Search for the Real Franz Kafka Continues" (Opinion guest essay, Feb. 5). As grateful as I am to Mr. Benjamin for his recent completist translation of Kafka's diaries, I don't think it's necessary to trash Max Brod, Kafka's friend and literary executor, for his less complete version.
Mr. Benjamin is anachronistic when he positions Brod as someone who does wrong by Kafka in cleaning up and vetting the Kafka diaries. Today we revere error, fragmentation and queerness. But when Brod published the diaries, he was embarking on a project at a time that none of these qualities were valued, and publishing any of it was against his great friend's wishes, so Brod took cautious yet important steps toward a reveal of Kafka.
Try to imagine publishing your best friend's very personal diaries, unedited, against their wishes many years after their death. I would suggest that what Brod did was just enough, indeed perfect for the moment, and that we see Mr. Benjamin's new fuller translation as following in Brod's great footsteps.
Rather than take Brod down, we should be on our knees to him for his courage and insight, and thank him for what he has given us.

News Literacy: The Antidote for Online Misinformation
To the Editor:
Re "A Ban on TikTok Won't Make Us More Secure," by Glenn S. Gerstell (Opinion guest essay, Feb. 4):
Privacy legislation is, indeed, a key part of a larger solution to helping our laws catch up to the realities of our digital world -- and to preventing foreign adversaries from using our data against us.
But we also need to help Americans learn how to navigate our online world and become less susceptible to manipulation. Otherwise, the threats that Mr. Gerstell so aptly described will remain.
Luckily, there is another promising solution: We can ensure that more Americans are news literate.
News literacy teaches you to identify credible sources and separate fact from fiction. Evidence increasingly shows that this approach can help "inoculate" people against being manipulated by misinformation. Just look to Finland, which requires media literacy instruction starting in preschool. Its citizens are the most resistant to misinformation of all Europeans surveyed, as you reported on Jan. 11 ("How Finland Teaches Even Youngest Pupils to Spot Misinformation").
We need a concerted effort from state and local governments to make news literacy instruction a reality for all Americans. Let's demand media literacy instruction in schools and protect ourselves from misleading claims that spread online.

Misdiagnosed by an Apple Watch
To the Editor:
Re "911 Gets a Call; It's Your Watch, and It's Worried" (front page, Feb. 4):
False-positive alerts from Apple Watch's health features are not new. In 2020, I co-wrote a peer-reviewed research study that discovered that many alerts from Apple Watch's abnormal heart rhythm detection feature were false positives.
We observed that for every seven patients who went to a health care setting with an alert, only one was diagnosed with clinically actionable cardiovascular disease. These erroneous alerts lead to the overuse of health care resources.
Apple and other technology companies must carefully consider unintended consequences of false-positive alerts when they develop health-focused features, lest their products turn into the algorithm that cried wolf.
Kirk D. WyattFargo, N.D.The writer is a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.
Unrepresentative Polls
To the Editor:
Re "Is Trump Way Up or Way Down?" (The Upshot, nytimes.com, Feb. 3):
Pollsters seem to want to ignore the simple fact that it is impossible to have a representative sample when people increasingly do not respond to pollsters. Pollsters argue that they use statistical tools to correct for unrepresentative samples, but their obvious failures in recent elections belie this.
Pollsters and the media, including The New York Times, have a vested interest in polling, but given all the poor polling it's hard to argue that it offers significant benefits. Polling is more speculative than news and should be treated as such.

At Their Brightest When Playing Dumb: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Nate Bargatze, Chase O'Donnell and the star of "Cunk on Earth" find smart nuances in pretending that they aren't the sharpest tools in the shed.
If there's one group of people who have been made fun of more than any other, it's the stupid.
From Homer Simpson to Zoolander to Rose from "The Golden Girls," no satirical target has produced more laughs. Jokes about the dumb are ancient and show up in nearly every country. Certain kinds go out of fashion (you don't hear Polish jokes much anymore), but the idiocy of others has proved universally funny.
Why don't we feel guilty about this? Sometimes, we do. But savvy comics have always found ways to mitigate the cruelty and condescension of mocking the moronic. And these days, when audiences can be particularly sensitive to the direction comedy is punching, the dumb joke often requires a lighter touch. Two deft new stand-up specials dig into stereotypes about the unintelligent, dust them off and renovate them for a new era, while a new mockumentary gets even bigger laughs through the stunt of placing a fool in a variety of intellectual arenas.
Nate Bargatze -- whose new special, "Hello World," is his first hour for Prime Video after breaking out with two popular and well-crafted Netflix efforts -- told The Daily Beast that he wanted his comedy to be "the right amount of dumb." His brand of clueless Christian dad self-deprecation isn't buffoonish. He presents himself as a little slow in a world that seems far too fast. He speaks with a hint of a drawl, and his delivery moseys as he settles into a gem of a story about the time he couldn't figure out how to turn off the light in a hotel room.
Bargatze, 42, says he knows he utters idiotic things, with a bit of bashfulness. "I try to keep it in front of large groups," he explains in the special. "When you say something dumb one on one, it's a lot for that person."
The moment is characteristic: thoughtful about his lack of thought. Bargatze, who has a gift for making something out of seemingly nothing, has emerged as one of the finest clean, family-friendly comics in America, firmly in the conversation with Jim Gaffigan, Jerry Seinfeld and Brian Regan. His last three specials begin with his adorable daughter introducing him. But he's putting an updated spin on another comedy tradition, the Southern rube, poking fun at his own dimness but also at those who would look down on him.
Bargatze draws attention to his roots (a previous special is called "The Tennessee Kid"), but unlike Larry the Cable Guy or Jim Varney, he doesn't lean on exaggerated accents or dopey language. When he tells you Andrew Jackson is from his town, it's to set up a scene in which a snotty interviewer informs him that Jackson was a bad man. "I stopped him and was like: We didn't, like, know him or anything," Bargatze says, the slightest touch of defensiveness mixed with minor annoyance. "We didn't move there because we were fans."
There is a gentleness to his ignorance, one that taps into a fertile area for laughs: childhood anxieties. Even his joke about struggling to turn off the light is designed not to make you laugh at him but relate to him. He acts out a kind of helplessness that we all once had and often still do. It's a dumb joke that makes you feel if not smart, then at least less alone in your stupidity.
While perhaps not as old as punch lines about country folk, the dumb blond joke has been around as long as America. Scholars trace it to a 1775 French one-act satire, "Les Curiosités de la Foire." The archetype boomed in the middle of the last century with the stardom of Marilyn Monroe in movies like "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." As that title suggests, blonds have favorable stereotypes attached to them, which makes poking fun at their intelligence, as well as their superficiality, a little more palatable. Because we think blonds have more fun, people can have more fun with them. And yet this has been under some scrutiny lately, reconsidered in movies about objectified stars like Pamela Anderson, Britney Spears and Monroe herself. (The recent drama about her was titled "Blonde" as if her hair color was her Rosebud).
The performer Chase O'Donnell plays more ditsy than dumb, but she leans into it. Years ago, she starred in a cabaret double act called "Too Blondes," and her new special, "People Pleaser," an enjoyable YouTube distraction, is full of self-deprecating jokes and precisely timed malapropisms. Her most faithful strategy is to begin a joke, pause, bug out her eyes in an innocent glare, then shift direction to upend expectations. When a date tells her to dye her hair, she acts offended. "I literally died," she says, glaring. "My hair the next day."
The quality of her joke-writing is not as assured as her persona. It's a low-budget production with rough edges, but like Bargatze, O'Donnell finds laughs in being more innocent than those around her. There are some darker undercurrents if you want to look for them, which you probably won't. A show about the consequences for a woman who can't say no is not what this breezy act is going for. And credit where it's due: It's hard to stay this light. She performs obliviousness with enough savvy to make you not quite believe it.
In the hilarious "Cunk on Earth" (now on Netflix) Diane Morgan performs imbecility in an entirely different way. She's an actor, not a stand-up, and as the spectacularly ill-informed anchor Philomena Cunk, she doesn't wink at the audience. She commits, brilliantly. Dressed stylishly in an overcoat and boots, speaking in the sober and dispassionate cadences of high-toned public television, she stands in the desert, musing pensively: "Looking at the pyramids tonight, it's hard not to be struck by the thought they are just big triangles."
This five-episode series, produced by the "Black Mirror" creator Charlie Brooker, is based on a simple idea -- place a dummy among posh, smart elites -- but it's exactingly executed. The show is beautifully shot and edited, impeccably deadpan and dense with jokes. In episodes that explore the history of civilization, our most popular religions or our greatest inventions, it captures a refined BBC aesthetic: staged in front of sweeping landscapes, inside museums or near ruins and featuring a collection of academics, authors and other intellectuals. How fully realized this world is only makes it funnier when Morgan, sitting across from a professor of Middle Eastern history, asks: "Were numbers worth less in ancient times?"
As with so many artists in the growing documentary comedy genre, Morgan uses real people as foils for her scripted lines. But in this case, they belong to a single class of experts whose tasteful clothes and thick spectacles project intelligence better than any design department could muster. There's cringe comedy in their fluster opposite her flamboyant imbecility. At no point does she break character. Her confidence is impenetrable, though sometimes she does use vulnerability strategically, as when she tells an academic she's worried that her question will sound stupid before asking about Aristotle saying, "Dance like no one's watching." This is a cagey manipulation that extends the scene and shifts the dynamic into something more polite than it otherwise would be.
It's a reminder of a piece of wisdom from David St. Hubbins of Spinal Tap, the metal band at the center of the greatest mockumentary: "It's such a fine line between stupid and clever."

A baby was killed and another was injured after becoming trapped in Baby Trend strollers, prompting the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday to warn customers about the potential dangers of some models.
The agency warned that the spaces in front of and behind the pivoting front canopy in the Sit N’ Stand Double and Ultra strollers with model numbers beginning with SS76 or SS66 can trap a child’s head or neck if another child climbs onto the stroller. It can also occur when the child in the front seat of the stroller is not properly restrained using all five points of the harness, the agency said.
The agency warned that being trapped in the stroller models — sold in stores such as Walmart, Target, Kohl’s and online through Amazon — “could lead to a loss of consciousness, serious injury or death.”
Customers are being encouraged to remove and store the stroller’s canopy when it’s not being used; not to allow children to play on strollers; and to fully secure a child in the stroller with the harness.
Baby Trend said it received one report of the asphyxiation death of a 14-month-old child who had not been in the stroller but got their neck trapped in the space between the front of the canopy tube and arm rest of a Baby Trend Sit N’ Stand double stroller.
In a separate incident reported to Baby Trend, a 17-month-old child who was partially secured in the stroller became trapped in the space between the back of the canopy tube and the seat back of the front seat, resulting in neck bruises.
The Sit N’ Stand Double and Ultra strollers with model numbers beginning with SS76 or SS66 have been sold nationwide since 2009. Each stroller has a black or silver frame and a black tray at the front with oval cutouts on the sides; the stroller’s model number is printed on a sticker on the left inside rear of the frame, near the axle.
In a statement, Baby Trend said that its strollers were “completely safe when used as intended and in accordance with the company’s operating instructions.” The company described the death of the child as “tragic” and “exceedingly rare,” saying it believed it could have been avoided if the baby hadn’t been climbing on the stroller.
“Baby Trend’s deep commitment to the safety of babies and families is a main reason why U.S. consumers have purchased more than 1 million of these strollers since 2009,” the company said. “Out of an abundance of caution, Baby Trend has joined with the CPSC to urge consumers to remove and store the stroller’s canopy when not in use.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Brazil’s Lula Heads to the White House

Full text: Enlarge this image.
It took 505 days for President Joe Biden to even talk to former President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, a far-right leader who questioned the legitimacy of Biden’s election.
It will take Biden just more than a month to welcome to the White House Bolsonaro’s successor, Brazil’s new leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Lula is scheduled to meet with Biden in the Oval Office on Friday for a wide-ranging conversation both sides have framed as a renewal of the relationship between the two largest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
The summit, 40 days into Lula’s presidency, also illustrates the warm embrace that Brazil’s new leader is receiving from foreign leaders across the world after four years of sometimes erratic foreign policy under Bolsonaro.
Just four years apart in age, Biden and Lula are both seasoned politicians with similar straight-talking, backslapping political styles, and both defeated right-wing presidents who resembled each other politically.
In their talks, Biden and Lula are likely to find plenty of common ground, including on climate change, protecting the Amazon rainforest and threats to democracy, a topic both men understand better than most.
They each faced far-right mobs storming their countries’ halls of power to challenge their elections, in scenes that were eerily similar, and they are likely to harp on that shared experience in public comments Friday, urging the safeguarding of democracies against disinformation and against authoritarian leaders.
“In a sense, this visit resumes bilateral relations,” Michel Arslanian Neto, the ambassador who oversees the Americas region in Brazil’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters Tuesday. “A relationship that has been a little bit on the back burner since Biden’s victory.”
But U.S. officials conceded that there could likely be some areas of disagreement, with one subject in particular having the potential for sparks: Ukraine.
While Lula has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he has also suggested in the past that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and NATO share some blame, and he has hesitated to sell weapons to Ukraine in an effort to maintain neutrality. Lula wants to try to help mediate peace in the conflict, while Biden is far more supportive of Ukraine, with little expectation that President Vladimir Putin of Russia has any interest in peace.
One senior Biden administration official said the two will have a candid discussion about the subject. Arslanian said Lula would avoid the topic of arms deals, and instead push his strategy to broker peace by convening a coalition of neutral countries, led by Brazil. Lula told reporters in Brazil this week that he did not expect Biden to try to pull Brazil into any war effort — and that Brazil would not entertain it anyway.
Brazil’s position on the Russia-Ukraine war is complicated by its reliance on Russia for about a quarter of its fertilizer imports, which are crucial to its enormous agriculture industry.
Political analysts have said that if disagreement over Ukraine becomes a major part of the talks, it has the potential to spoil a summit that should be an easy foreign-policy win for both countries.
“Even though these are two leaders with a lot in common, their underlying world views and national interests are quite different, and Ukraine is a big one,” said Brian Winter, a writer and analyst who tracks Latin America for the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, a group that pushes free trade in the Americas. “Primarily because of that issue, I do think there’s potential for both sides to walk away from this meeting with a somewhat sour taste.”
But there is also plenty to agree on. Before the meeting, both sides stressed the countries’ shared desire and increasing cooperation to combat climate change. Brazil’s new environment minister, Marina Silva, is also in Washington on Friday. John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, has already met with Lula administration officials twice and is planning to visit Brazil this year.
After four years of increasing deforestation under Bolsonaro, Lula has made protecting the Amazon a central priority, including a recent push to eject illegal miners from one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories. Arslanian said Lula will seek cooperation and funds from the United States in that mission.
The U.S. official said that protecting the Amazon was vital.
Both countries established a working group for joint discussions on illegal deforestation, but under Bolsonaro only three meetings were held.
Lula is also eager to make right-wing extremism part of the agenda, Arslanian said, particularly with a focus on how social media fuels misinformation and hate speech. In Brazil, Lula has said his administration would push for legislation to curb online extremism and misinformation. Such national laws can be effective in regulating tech companies in that specific jurisdiction, but they often do not have a global effect.
The two men are also set to discuss economic ties, including boosting Brazil’s manufacturing industry as the United States seeks to reduce its reliance on China.
Lula would like Brazil to receive funds from the CHIPS and Science Act, a law Biden signed last year to boost the United States’ capabilities in producing computer chips, a critical industry dominated by Asia. Brazilian companies believe they can handle certain phases of chip production, and Lula wants U.S. funds to help make Brazil part of a regional chip supply chain, Arslanian said.
There are also some potential awkward topics. Bolsonaro has been in Florida since Dec. 30, while he is facing investigations in Brazil for his activity as president, probes that he calls politically motivated. Bolsonaro increased Brazil’s ties with the United States as part of his friendship with former President Donald Trump, which was built on their similar world views.
But Biden’s election quickly led to a frosty relationship between the two governments. Bolsonaro was one of the last world leaders to recognize Biden’s victory, and then the men did not speak until they met on the sidelines of a conference last year.
The situation could get tricky if Brazilian authorities bring charges against the former president and he is on U.S. territory, though it seems unlikely U.S. officials would be interested in protecting him. U.S. officials said they would handle any request through appropriate processes.
The administration official said that it was not clear whether Lula would raise the issue of Bolsonaro with Biden, but that the president would be ready to discuss any subject that comes up on Friday.
Another potential source of conflict is Lula’s history of harsh criticism of U.S. foreign policy, including accusations that the Justice Department helped drive the corruption investigation that landed Lula in prison in 2018. Lula has long maintained his innocence, saying political enemies framed him to eliminate his leftist Workers’ Party from Brazilian politics.
Brazilian prosecutors “were servants of the U.S. Justice Department,” he told Al Jazeera in 2020. The U.S. government wanted to destroy Brazilian engineering companies and Brazil’s state-owned oil company because they were winning contracts around the world, he said. “The Americans never accepted that,” he said.
The U.S. government did aid Brazilian authorities in their investigation, according to leaked messages, though the extent of their collaboration is unclear. The State Department has declined to comment on the subject. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Reigniting Old Flames And Dousing Them Out: [Review]

Full text: In Dave Franco's new comedy, Alison Brie plays a reality television showrunner attempting to break up her ex-boyfriend's engagement.
In the catalog of comedies about city strivers who decamp to their suburban hometowns to hassle former lovers, Dave Franco's "Somebody I Used to Know" is an upbeat but minor entry, destined to recede behind the worthier stories from which it borrows. The unfortunate irony of the movie's title -- one word off from the Gotye earworm, presumably to preserve search engine optimization, if not originality -- is that the film lacks the indelible details and authentic feeling necessary to encode it in long-term memory. Indeed, soon after finishing the movie, it already feels far away.
The story begins as Ally (Alison Brie), a reality television showrunner, craftily wrests a tearful disclosure from an interview subject on camera. It should be a triumphant moment, but the implication is that in her pursuit of Hollywood success, Ally has sold her soul and sacrificed her dignity. Not to worry: The chance for a reset arrives after the network declines to renew the show, and Ally, whose workaholism has left her friendless, makes the impromptu decision to visit her mother (a criminally underused Julie Hagerty) in Leavenworth, a small town situated in the mountains of Washington.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This cinematic overture is among the most successful sequences in the movie, and sets us up for a conventional but comforting journey back to more wholesome roots. It also teases a gleefully unlikable protagonist who's more schemer than achiever and more sourpuss than socialite; Brie (who co-wrote the script with Franco) has a knack for tapping into her nasty side, and as we zigzag through a handful of set pieces that don't quite register comedically -- one hinges on cat diarrhea -- we yearn for our city mouse to go fully feral.
Regrettably, the moment never arrives. While in Leavenworth, Ally bumps into her ex-boyfriend, Sean (Jay Ellis), and is aggrieved to learn of his recent engagement to Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons), a self-possessed local punk singer. Ally spends the remainder of the film's running time batting eyelashes and crashing wedding events as she conspires to reignite their old flame. It's remarkable that nobody tells her to get lost and get a life; despite some side-eyeing, even Cassidy and her protective pals seem glad to have the grating Ally around.
As the movie's co-writer and director, Franco brings a sunny disposition and a touch of idiosyncratic farce. There are the usual jaunty montage sequences and forlorn shots of characters gazing out windows, but there is also vomit, obscene texts and an overwhelming dose of public nudity. Franco and Brie are clearly riffing on a suite of movies about career women rediscovering roots and wreaking havoc on old relationships -- "My Best Friend's Wedding," "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Young Adult" come to mind -- and seek to inject the familiar premise with millennial novelty.
But there's something missing from the equation. Each of those predecessors appreciate that their heroines, in acting harshly toward their peers, also become their villains. By reeling in Ally's ruthlessness, expunging her comeuppance and mollifying those she wrongs, "Somebody I Used to Know" actually distances us from Ally and her issues. The truth is that jealousy and cruelty are human; anything less is just a portrait with the blemishes erased.

Promising New Drug To Fight Coronavirus Faces Market Hurdles: [National Desk]

Full text: A new drug quashes all coronavirus variants. But regulatory hurdles and a lack of funding make it unlikely to reach the U.S. market anytime soon.
Over the past year, America's arsenal of Covid treatments has shrunk as new variants of the coronavirus have eroded the potency of drug after drug. Many patients are now left with a single option, Paxlovid. While highly effective, it poses problems for many people who need it because of dangerous interactions with other medications.
But a new class of variant-proof treatments could help restock the country's armory. Scientists on Wednesday reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that a single injection of a so-called interferon drug slashed by half a Covid patient's odds of being hospitalized.
The results, demonstrated in a clinical trial of nearly 2,000 patients, rivaled those achieved by Paxlovid. And the interferon shots hold even bigger promise, scientists said. By fortifying the body's own mechanisms for quashing an invading virus, they can potentially help defend against not only Covid, but also the flu and other viruses with the potential to kindle future pandemics.
"It doesn't matter if the next pandemic is a coronavirus, an influenza virus, or another respiratory virus," said Eleanor Fish, an immunologist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the new study. "For all the viruses we're seeing that are circulating now, there's utility to using interferon."
For all of its promise, though, the drug -- called pegylated interferon lambda -- faces an uncertain road to the commercial market. Regulators at the Food and Drug Administration late last year told the drug's maker, Eiger Biopharmaceuticals, that they were not prepared to authorize it for emergency use. Eiger executives said part of the problem seemed to be that the clinical trial did not include an American site, but rather only sites in Brazil and Canada, and that it was initiated and run by academic researchers, rather than the company itself.
The regulators suggested that only a large clinical trial conducted at least in part in the United States and with more involvement from the company would suffice, Eiger executives said, a scenario that would require several years and considerably more funding. An F.D.A. spokeswoman said disclosure laws prevented the agency from commenting.
Those barriers are indicative of problems that some experts worry are threatening the development of a wide range of next-generation Covid treatments and vaccines -- products that may help address the ongoing toll from Covid and also give scientists a head start in preparing for the next pandemic.
As it stands, Eiger executives said that they might seek authorization for the interferon shot outside of the United States. China, for example, has been looking for new treatment options.
Some scientists involved in the research expressed frustration that doctors could not already prescribe the shots. Despite vaccines and previous infections helping to contain the damage from the virus, Covid is still killing roughly 450 Americans daily.
"I think it is a crazy situation that we're still here now, three years into the pandemic, and I have one drug that I can prescribe with confidence to people who are getting infected," said Dr. Jeffrey Glenn, a virologist and director of a pandemic preparedness initiative at Stanford University, who helped lead the study of the interferon shot. "We need more options."
Dr. Glenn founded Eiger, holds shares in Eiger and sits on its board of directors, but no longer works for the company.
Interferons are a group of proteins that alert neighboring cells to fortify themselves in the hours after a virus invades. The coronavirus, like other viruses, is good at defusing the body's natural interferon response. A drug that delivered extra interferons, researchers believed, could potentially help patients outmaneuver the virus.
In targeting patients' immune responses, rather than the virus itself, those treatments potentially offered another advantage over existing treatments, reducing the chance that a variant would evolve that could resist the drug, said Vineet Menachery, an immunologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch.
A number of monoclonal antibodies have fallen out of use because they stopped working against new variants. Paxlovid has remained effective because it is much more difficult for the virus to get around, but new variants could one day render it less useful, too.
"I don't know of any virus that can navigate a cell where interferon got there first," said Benjamin tenOever, a microbiologist at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine.
Harnessing those capabilities in a drug, though, is not easy. Interferons can trigger wide-ranging side effects, including inflammation, a risk in Covid cases because some patients have an overactive immune response.
"You basically tell your body you're being highly infected by a virus, and to fight, fight, fight at all costs," said Juliet Morrison, a microbiologist at the University of California, Riverside.
Previous studies had tested interferon treatments only on patients who were already sick and in the hospital. That meant that the drugs were often administered too late, leading to mixed or disappointing results.
The scientists behind the Eiger drug envisioned a clever workaround.
With hepatitis treatments in mind, they had previously acquired a drug based on lambda interferons, a lesser-known type of interferon whose receptors are largely restricted to specific areas, like the respiratory tract. That happened to be precisely where the coronavirus was replicating. And it meant that the side effects would theoretically be less intense than those from the more commonly used class of interferons, whose receptors are throughout the body.
Those hopes were borne out in the latest trial. After administering the shot to about 900 patients and giving another 1,000 patients a placebo, the researchers found no appreciable difference in the incidence of side effects, they said.
Vaccination kept the vast majority of patients in both groups safe from hospitalization or a prolonged emergency department visit. But treating patients with interferon within a week after they noticed symptoms halved their chances of being hospitalized: Twenty-five people given the shot were hospitalized, compared with 57 who had not been treated.
The effects were even more pronounced when the drug was given within three days of symptoms developing, and when it was given to unvaccinated people. Most of the patients in the study were at relatively high risk from Covid -- either because they were 50 or older, or because they had an underlying condition or a weakened immune system.
And the drug appeared to work across variants, showing even more potency when Omicron was dominant, the study found.
"Despite the pandemic being less of an emergency than it was at its peak, we're still seeing people coming into the hospital and getting very sick with Covid," said Dr. Jordan Feld, a specialist in viral hepatitis at the University of Toronto, who is a co-author of the study and has received funding from Eiger. "Having treatment options to try to prevent that from happening would be really helpful."
Some researchers said they envisioned testing interferon drugs in people who were seeking treatment for a range of respiratory viruses, including the flu and R.S.V., or respiratory syncytial virus, which put considerable pressure on hospitals this winter. Doctors could even treat patients before they knew which virus was causing them problems.
Some studies have also suggested that the same class of drugs, if used quickly enough, could prevent people exposed to the virus from getting infected in the first place.
"I suspect the greatest utility of all these interferons will be in prophylactic treatment," said Dr. Fish of the University of Toronto, "especially in outbreak settings for high-risk individuals to protect them from infection."

Full text: You may never have to deal with a missing device, but planning ahead with a few simple steps can make it easier if disaster strikes.
The average smartphone contains so much of one's personal life -- photos, list of contacts, calendar, email, digital wallet -- that the loss of that handy slab of glass and metal can be highly disruptive and disorienting. You may never have to face this situation, but you would be wise to plan for it, especially if you have children with their own phones.
Here's a guide to what you can do before and after you lose or break your phone.
Basic Precautions
A sturdy drop-resistant case and a screen protector are starters for safeguarding your phone from physical damage. Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has case recommendations for iPhones.
A lost phone can be a security risk, so make sure you have facial or fingerprint recognition enabled and a strong passcode in place to lock the screen.
Your phone's location services feature can also help you find the device if you lose it, so make sure to enable location in your Android or iOS settings if you've turned it off. Remember, you can adjust the access apps have to your location in the settings for privacy.
Keep a record of the phone's identification numbers (the serial number and International Mobile Equipment Identity number) in case you need the information later to file a police report. You can find the numbers in the settings or by dialing *#06# on the phone's keypad. Take a screenshot and send it your computer for safekeeping.
Insurance Options
Buying insurance or extended warranty coverage for your phone costs money up front, but it can bring benefits like 24/7 support, low-cost repairs and same-day replacements for unusable devices.
If you're not sure you need insurance, factor in how long you intend to keep the phone, how you use the device and if you can afford out-of-pocket repairs. In some cases, the insurance can cost more than the repair, so read the warranty or policy closely before investing in it.
You're typically prodded to sign up when you purchase a new phone. AppleCare, Google Preferred Care and Samsung Care+ are common manufacturer plans; AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are among the carriers offering coverage. Third-party insurance companies like Assurant, Asurion and Akko sell policies for smartphones, as do some general insurance providers like Progressive and USAA.
Back It Up
With your phone's Apple, Google or Samsung account, you get a certain amount of "cloud" storage -- internet-connected servers where you can back up files. Cloud backup is simple: Once enabled, the phone should automatically back up when it's plugged into power and connected to a Wi-Fi network.
If you have a lot of content on your phone, you may need to buy more space for a few dollars a month.
Set your Apple iCloud, Google or Samsung account to sync across devices, and then your email, contacts, notes and calendar will be backed up to your provider's cloud. But you may also want to preserve things like call history, text messages and other information from the phone.
Apple, Google and Samsung all have instructions on their sites for configuring cloud backup on their gear. Google's Google One service also works with other Android phones and devices.
If your camera roll is your primary concern, Google Photos, iCloud Photos and other services like Amazon Photos and Dropbox can be set to back up pictures automatically.
If you prefer to keep your files off remote servers because of privacy and security concerns, you can back up to your computer instead. Apple's iOS devices can be backed up to a Mac or PC using a USB cable or Wi-Fi connection; that backup can later be transferred to a new iPhone or iPad. Google's site has instructions for transferring Android files to a computer and Samsung's free Smart Switch app for Windows, Mac and Android can backup and transfer your Galaxy phone files.
Looking for the Phone
If you lost your phone or fear it was stolen, search for it using the Apple, Google or Samsung "find my device" pages, or with tools like Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device apps. If your phone still works, the location setting is enabled and it is connected to a network, you should see the device's whereabouts displayed on a map.
Apple's Find My app can warn you if you leave a device behind and includes a Mark as Lost setting to lock the phone with a passcode and disable Apple Pay. But if the device seems to be in an unfamiliar location, you can use these tracking tools to remotely lock or erase your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy or other Android phone.
If the phone appears to be permanently missing or you know it was stolen, inform your wireless carrier and report the loss to the police; you'll probably need to supply those serial and I.M.E.I. numbers. File an insurance claim if you have a policy, change your passwords and alert your financial institutions to watch for suspicious account activity.
Deal With Damage
Accidents happen. Waterlogged hardware and cracked screens are common phone mishaps. Apple, Google and Samsung have their own guides for dealing with water damage, which can be less fatal than it used to be. (Many experts advise against dunking the wet phone in dry rice to draw out moisture.)
For the technically adventurous, the do-it-yourself site iFixit has illustrated guides to common repairs. But for many people, smashed glass or fried electronics mean a trip to a professional service center. Check with your phone manufacturer and wireless carrier for your options.
National chains like CPR or Asurion Tech Repairs & Solutions (formerly UbreakiFix) work with some insurance policies. And speaking of insurance policies, if you signed up for one, go file that claim.

Your phone manufacturer's built-in online backup feature, right, is easy to set up and use, but you may quickly run out of storage space.

4.9 Million Fabuloso Bottles Recalled for Bacteria Risk

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
About 4.9 million bottles of multipurpose cleaning product Fabuloso have been recalled because they may contain a bacteria that can cause a serious infection in people with weakened immune systems and others with health risks, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday.
The recalled products were sold online through Amazon and other websites as well as in brick-and-mortar stores including Dollar General, Family Dollar, Walmart and Home Depot from December 2022 through January. Several sizes of Fabuloso were recalled in scents including lavender, lemon and ocean.
Fabuloso’s manufacturer, Colgate-Palmolive, said in a statement that a preservative had not been added “at the intended levels” during the manufacturing process and that the “inadequate” amount of the preservative might have allowed bacteria to grow.
The recalled products may include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens, bacteria that can enter the body through inhalation, the eyes or a break in the skin. The recall notice said that people with healthy immune systems were not usually affected by the bacteria, but people with weakened immune systems, external medical devices or underlying lung conditions could contract a serious infection if exposed to it.
The commission said that no incidents or injuries had been reported from the recalled product.
Colgate-Palmolive advised people to stop using the recalled cleaners and not to empty the bottles before throwing them away. About 3.9 million of the recalled bottles had not been sold, Colgate-Palmolive said. The recall also included about 56,000 bottles of the cleaner sold in Canada.
People who purchased the recalled bottles should contact Colgate-Palmolive for a refund or for a free replacement product. “We remain committed to maintaining the highest level of product quality and have taken action to help ensure we live up to those standards,” the company said.
The recall did not include bottles of Fabuloso antibacterial cleaner or other Fabuloso products. The recalled and unaffected products are listed online.
Fabuloso debuted in Venezuela in the 1980s, then gained popularity in Mexico before it was introduced in the United States in 1996 and became the cleaner of choice for many Latino households.
Fabuloso is the latest cleaning brand to recall products because they may contain bacteria. About 37 million bottles of scented Pine-Sol were recalled in October, and about 8 million bottles of the Laundress brand products were recalled in December.

Bed Bath & Beyond Is Said to Get Backing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hudson Bay Capital has essentially agreed to make sure the troubled retailer will sell roughly $ 1 billion in shares as it tries to avoid bankruptcy.
Bed Bath & Beyond's plan to use a public stock offering as a way to raise more than $ 1 billion and avoid bankruptcy will be backed by the investment firm Hudson Bay Capital Management, two people familiar with the situation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the terms of the deal have not been made public.
Bed Bath & Beyond disclosed the deal on Monday without naming Hudson Bay. It hopes that raising enough cash will restore the confidence of suppliers, preserve jobs and allow the company to pursue a turnaround plan it announced in August.
The retailer said on Tuesday that it had already underwritten the initial $ 225 million worth of shares it was selling. It plans to sell an additional $ 800 million over time, assuming "certain conditions are met." The company did not disclose what those conditions were.
Hudson Bay, though, has essentially agreed to buy the stock, assuming Bed Bath & Beyond sells the additional shares.
Hudson Bay is a multibillion-dollar fund based in Greenwich, Conn. It often acts as a mergers specialist, either betting passively on whether company deals go through or fall apart or, at other times, pushing for such moves.
The firm is likely looking to take advantage of Bed Bath & Beyond's rising share price, with hopes of selling when it goes even higher. Retail investors helped drive the price up nearly 100 percent on Monday, before Bed Bath & Beyond announced its plan to offer stock. Shares fell nearly 50 percent in trading on Tuesday, to around $ 3.
"This transformative transaction will provide runway to execute our turnaround plan," Sue Gove, Bed Bath & Beyond's chief executive, said in a statement. "As we make important strategic and operational changes, we will continue to take disciplined steps to enhance our cost base and improve our financial position."
A spokesperson for Hudson Bay did not respond to request for comment. Bed Bath & Beyond did not respond to a request for additional comment on the transaction. The deal between the hedge fund and the retailer was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Some analysts doubt whether the deal will be enough to help the struggling home goods retailer.
"The fundamental story for Bed Bath & Beyond is so broken at this point," David Silverman, retail analyst at Fitch Ratings, said. "I don't know that a short-term cash infusion that could buy them a few months, a couple of quarters, is going to change their fate."
The deal with Hudson Bay came together within the past several weeks, the two people familiar with the matter said. Late last month, JPMorgan Chase, which helped give Bed Bath & Beyond a lifeline this summer by expanding its credit line, froze the retailer's credit accounts after notifying it that it was in breach of the terms of its debt. As Bed Bath & Beyond raced to find cash to pay its debts, tensions built over the amount information it was sharing with its banks and other creditors and how quickly it was relaying it to them, the people said.
The retailer's lenders had dealt with a great deal of turbulence over the past few months. In early September, weeks after Bed Bath & Beyond secured rescue financing from JPMorgan and the investment firm Sixth Street, the company's chief financial officer died in what was ruled a suicide. Industry executives have questioned whether the retailer had the right management in place to weather its challenges.
On Monday, Bed Bath & Beyond said Holly Etlin had been hired as the interim chief financial officer. Ms. Etlin has experience with restructurings and company turnarounds.
Rising interest rates have also made lenders warier of plowing more money into distressed companies like Bed Bath & Beyond. But equity may prove to be a new alternative.
Bed Bath & Beyond's move echoes what appears to be a new playbook for distressed retailers. Another indebted company favored by meme traders, AMC Entertainment, sold investors preferred shares in August after common shareholders balked at its efforts to issue more stock, which dilutes the value of shares that are already held. Both sets of AMC shares have remained volatile. In 2020, Hertz tried to sell shares after filing for bankruptcy, but the Securities and Exchange Commission squashed those efforts.
"For those who are in this situation, for those who are desperate, this will be one instrument that they can use," said Douglas Chia, the head of Soundboard Governance, a corporate governance consultancy. "Every couple years there's a new instrument that investment bankers come up with, and it's creative and it becomes the flavor of the month and everyone starts to use that. This could be the same thing."
The question for Bed Bath & Beyond and the roughly 30,000 people it employed as of last February is whether it will be enough. Even if this financing goes through, the company faces the same challenges that have plagued it the past couple of months. The retailer is contending with low inventory in its stores as vendors hold back on shipping items because of worries about its finances. It also has a less sophisticated e-commerce operation than many of its competitors and a dwindling customer base.
The stock offering "by itself doesn't change the business model or any of those tough decisions that they need to make," said Patrick Collins, a partner who works on bankruptcies and restructurings at the law firm Farrell Fritz.
The deal could give Bed Bath & Beyond only a few more quarters of financial runway, said Seth Basham, a retail analyst at the investment firm Wedbush Capital.
The company is ramping up the number of stores it's closing to more than 400, including Harmon stores. That's a significant chunk of the 950 stores that it had when the closings began in August.
Sales keep sliding as well. Bed Bath & Beyond has said it expects comparable sales in the first quarter to decline 30 to 40 percent from a year earlier, but expects to see quarterly sales improving afterward.
It projects that its ability to have goods in stock will return to normal levels by the important back-to-college shopping season.
Not everyone is convinced.
"It is very difficult to see where they could be able to reverse those trends quickly, particularly given we're in a somewhat challenging environment for retail goods," Fitch's Mr. Silverman said. "You've got competitors like Target, Amazon, Walmart and low- and mid-tier department stores that aren't relinquishing market share."

Scandal-Plagued National Enquirer Sold: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The publication has come under scrutiny in recent years over its suppression of stories about Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign.
The National Enquirer, the celebrity tabloid behind the "catch and kill" suppression of damaging stories about Donald J. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, has finally been sold by its parent company.
A360 Media has agreed to sell the publication in a cash deal to VVIP Ventures, a joint venture of the digital media company Vinco Ventures and a new company set up for the purchase, Icon Publishing, the companies announced on Monday. The price was not disclosed.
Two of the National Enquirer's stablemates, the National Examiner and Globe, will also be acquired as part of the deal, along with the British edition of the Enquirer.
The National Enquirer has come under scrutiny in recent years for a litany of scandals. It paid $ 150,000 in hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, for the rights to her story of an affair with Mr. Trump, then never published the story. The practice is known as "catch and kill." It also helped broker a hush-money deal with the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.
In 2019, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, accused the Enquirer of extortion and blackmail in exposing his extramarital affair. The Enquirer's publisher, formerly known as American Media, was pushed by its majority owner, the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management, to get rid of the tabloid. In April 2019, American Media announced that it would sell the Enquirer and several other publications to James Cohen, an heir to the Hudson News empire, for $ 100 million. But the sale never went through, eventually fizzling during the pandemic.
One of the new buyers of the National Enquirer, Icon Publishing, was founded by Ted Farnsworth, the former chairman of the start-up theater subscription company MoviePass. In November, Mr. Farnsworth was indicted by the Department of Justice on charges of defrauding investors. He declined to comment on the charges.
The other buyer in the joint venture, Vinco Ventures, has a majority stake in Lomotif, a TikTok rival, and owns AdRizer, an ad tech company.
The buyers said in an interview that they planned to expand the publications' digital presence and tap the Enquirer's expansive archives of nearly 100 years of celebrity news and gossip.
"Since I was a little kid, I've seen the National Enquirer everywhere you go, all over the country and in Europe, too," said Rod Vanderbilt, the executive chairman of Vinco Ventures. "That brand recognition is amazing and is going to play such a role in cross-pollinating with other companies we have."
Mr. Farnsworth, the founder of Icon Publishing, declined to specify the cost of the deal, but said it was "a little less" than the $ 100 million price tag that was previously considered.
"It was just a sleeping giant sitting there not taking any advantage of the digital side," he said.
He said that the publications were profitable, mostly from print and subscription sales, with estimated revenues of about $ 29 million and about $ 13.5 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. As part of the deal, the buyers will have a 90-day exclusive window to buy other A360 Media publications. There is also a multiyear agreement for A360 Media to continue to provide publishing and distribution services for the print products.
Mr. Farnsworth said the editorial teams of the magazines would be retained and would continue publishing as normal. He said the new owners intended to aggressively pursue TV, film and podcast opportunities.
The Enquirer's archives, he added, have "everything from Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, all the way back."
"Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of articles over the years that we have at our disposal, something that no one else has," he said.
In a statement, Doug Olson, the president of A360 Media, said, "It's clear this is the home we have been waiting for to place these publications."
The deal is expected to close in the coming months.

Vox Is Said to Get $100 Million Infusion: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions and investments made by Penske Media, the owner of a swath of entertainment and trade publications including Rolling Stone and Variety.
Vox Media, owner of publications including New York Magazine and tech site The Verge, is raising $ 100 million from Penske Media, the owner of a swath of entertainment and trade publications including Rolling Stone and Variety, according to several people with knowledge of the deal.
As a result of the investment, Penske Media will own about 20 percent of Vox Media, making it the largest shareholder of the company, according to one of the people with knowledge of the terms.
The terms represent a significant discount compared with Vox Media's last funding round, in 2015, when NBCUniversal invested $ 200 million in the company at a valuation of about $ 1 billion. NBCUniversal's investment in Vox Media came during a boom for digital publishing, when companies like BuzzFeed, Vice Media and HuffPost were raising money at sky-high valuations.
In recent years, valuations for digital media companies have plunged as platforms like Google, Meta and Amazon have taken an ever-larger share of the digital-media market.
In a note to employees, Vox Media's chief executive, Jim Bankoff, said that the two companies would continue to operate separately, "with editorial and business independence," adding that the companies would partner where it was beneficial.
The investment, Mr. Bankoff said in his note, "fortifies our ambitions to grow sustainably and pursue opportunities that align with our goals, especially during this time of economic uncertainty." Jay Penske, the chief executive and co-founder of Penske Media, said in an announcement that he had long admired Vox Media's "world-class" journalists.
"The Penske Media and Vox Media alliance will further cement both companies as leaders in modern media and take advantage of new opportunities at scale," Mr. Penske said.
Vox Media owns an array of digital tech, sports and lifestyle publications, including Recode, SB Nation, Eater and Vulture. The company has struck stock deals to acquire other digital media properties in recent years, buying Group Nine Media, a holding company that owned The Dodo animal site; Thrillist, a site for food and travel enthusiasts; and NowThis, a social-first news company.
Like other media companies, Vox Media has been hurt by the recent downturn in the advertising market. Mr. Bankoff announced last month that the company was laying off about 7 percent of its staff, citing the possibility of a "prolonged downturn."
In addition to raising funds, Vox Media has met with other media companies to discuss potential acquisitions or sales of some of its media properties, according to two other people familiar with the matter. In recent years, the company has sought to reduce its reliance on advertising by developing new lines of revenue including digital subscriptions, and e-commerce.
Vox Media could use the money to make acquisitions to expand its business, one of the people with knowledge of the deal said, adding that the company doesn't plan to raise additional money.
The Vox Media deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions and investments made by Penske Media. Last month, a subsidiary of the company, Penske Media Eldridge, announced a deal to acquire Dick Clark Productions, the live entertainment production company behind "Dick Clark's Rockin' Eve."
Much of Penske Media's revenue comes from live events, including LA3C, a Los Angeles-based festival celebrating music, art and food. The company is also an owner of South by Southwest, a festival known for previewing emerging tech companies.

Full text: Marisa Shuman's computer science class at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx began as usual on a recent January morning.
Just after 11:30, energetic 11th and 12th graders bounded into the classroom, settled down at communal study tables and pulled out their laptops. Then they turned to the front of the room, eyeing a whiteboard where Ms. Shuman had posted a question on wearable technology, the topic of that day's class.
For the first time in her decade-long teaching career, Ms. Shuman had not written any of the lesson plan. She had generated the class material using ChatGPT, a new chatbot that relies on artificial intelligence to deliver written responses to questions in clear prose. Ms. Shuman was using the algorithm-generated lesson to examine the chatbot's potential usefulness and pitfalls with her students.
"I don't care if you learn anything about wearable technology today," Ms. Shuman said to her students. "We are evaluating ChatGPT. Your goal is to identify whether the lesson is effective or ineffective."
Across the United States, universities and school districts are scrambling to get a handle on new chatbots that can generate humanlike texts and images. But while many are rushing to ban ChatGPT to try to prevent its use as a cheating aid, teachers like Ms. Shuman are leveraging the innovations to spur more critical classroom thinking. They are encouraging their students to question the hype around rapidly evolving artificial intelligence tools and consider the technologies' potential side effects.
The aim, these educators say, is to train the next generation of technology creators and consumers in "critical computing." That is an analytical approach in which understanding how to critique computer algorithms is as important as -- or more important than -- knowing how to program computers.
New York City Public Schools, the nation's largest district, serving some 900,000 students, is training a cohort of computer science teachers to help their students identify A.I. biases and potential risks. Lessons include discussions on defective facial recognition algorithms that can be much more accurate in identifying white faces than darker-skinned faces.
In Illinois, Florida, New York and Virginia, some middle school science and humanities teachers are using an A.I. literacy curriculum developed by researchers at the Scheller Teacher Education Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One lesson asks students to consider the ethics of powerful A.I. systems, known as "generative adversarial networks," that can be used to produce fake media content, like realistic videos in which well-known politicians mouth phrases they never actually said.
With generative A.I. technologies proliferating, educators and researchers say understanding such computer algorithms is a crucial skill that students will need to navigate daily life and participate in civics and society.
"It's important for students to know about how A.I. works because their data is being scraped, their user activity is being used to train these tools," said Kate Moore, an education researcher at M.I.T. who helped create the A.I. lessons for schools. "Decisions are being made about young people using A.I., whether they know it or not."
To observe how some educators are encouraging their students to scrutinize A.I. technologies, I recently spent two days visiting classes at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx, a public middle and high school for girls that is at the forefront of this trend.
The hulking, beige-brick school specializes in math, science and technology. It serves nearly 550 students, most of them Latinx or Black.
It is by no means a typical public school. Teachers are encouraged to help their students become, as the school's website puts it, "innovative" young women with the skills to complete college and "influence public attitudes, policies and laws to create a more socially just society." The school also has an enviable four-year high school graduation rate of 98 percent, significantly higher than the average for New York City high schools.
One morning in January, about 30 ninth and 10th graders, many of them dressed in navy blue school sweatshirts and gray pants, loped into a class called Software Engineering 1. The hands-on course introduces students to coding, computer problem-solving and the social repercussions of tech innovations.
It is one of several computer science courses at the school that ask students to consider how popular computer algorithms -- often developed by tech company teams of mostly white and Asian men -- may have disparate impacts on groups like immigrants and low-income communities. That morning's topic: face-matching systems that may have difficulty recognizing darker-skinned faces, such as those of some of the students in the room and their families.
Standing in front of her class, Abby Hahn, the computing teacher, knew her students might be shocked by the subject. Faulty face-matching technology has helped lead to the false arrests of Black men.
So Ms. Hahn alerted her pupils that the class would be discussing sensitive topics like racism and sexism. Then she played a YouTube video, created in 2018 by Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist, showing how some popular facial analysis systems mistakenly identified iconic Black women as men.
As the class watched the video, some students gasped. Oprah Winfrey "appears to be male," Amazon's technology said with 76.5 percent confidence, according to the video. Other sections of the video said that Microsoft's system had mistaken Michelle Obama for "a young man wearing a black shirt," and that IBM's system had pegged Serena Williams as "male" with 89 percent confidence.
(Microsoft and Amazon later announced accuracy improvements to their systems, and IBM stopped selling such tools. Amazon said it was committed to continuously improving its facial analysis technology through customer feedback and collaboration with researchers, and Microsoft and IBM said they were committed to the responsible development of A.I.)
"I'm shocked at how colored women are seen as men, even though they look nothing like men," Nadia Zadine, a 14-year-old student, said. "Does Joe Biden know about this?"
The point of the A.I. bias lesson, Ms. Hahn said, was to show student programmers that computer algorithms can be faulty, just like cars and other products designed by humans, and to encourage them to challenge problematic technologies.
"You are the next generation," Ms. Hahn said to the young women as the class period ended. "When you are out in the world, are you going to let this happen?"
"No!" a chorus of students responded.
A few doors down the hall, in a colorful classroom strung with handmade paper snowflakes and origami cranes, Ms. Shuman was preparing to teach a more advanced programming course, Software Engineering 3, focused on creative computing like game design and art. Earlier that week, her student coders had discussed how new A.I.-powered systems like ChatGPT can analyze vast stores of information and then produce humanlike essays and images in response to short prompts.
As part of the lesson, the 11th and 12th graders read news articles about how ChatGPT could be both useful and error-prone. They also read social media posts about how the chatbot could be prompted to generate texts promoting hate and violence.
But the students could not try ChatGPT in class themselves. The school district has blocked it over concerns that it could be used for cheating. So the students asked Ms. Shuman to use the chatbot to create a lesson for the class as an experiment.
Ms. Shuman spent hours at home prompting the system to generate a lesson on wearable technology like smartwatches. In response to her specific requests, ChatGPT produced a remarkably detailed 30-minute lesson plan -- complete with a warm-up discussion, readings on wearable technology, in-class exercises and a wrap-up discussion.
As the class period began, Ms. Shuman asked the students to spend 20 minutes following the scripted lesson, as if it were a real class on wearable technology. Then they would analyze ChatGPT's effectiveness as a simulated teacher.
Huddled in small groups, students read aloud information the bot had generated on the conveniences, health benefits, brand names and market value of smartwatches and fitness trackers. There were groans as students read out ChatGPT's anodyne sentences -- "Examples of smart glasses include Google Glass Enterprise 2" -- that they said sounded like marketing copy or rave product reviews.
"It reminded me of fourth grade," Jayda Arias, 18, said. "It was very bland."
The class found the lesson stultifying compared with those by Ms. Shuman, a charismatic teacher who creates course materials for her specific students, asks them provocative questions and comes up with relevant, real-world examples on the fly.
"The only effective part of this lesson is that it's straightforward," Alexania Echevarria, 17, said of the ChatGPT material.
"ChatGPT seems to love wearable technology," noted Alia Goddess Burke, 17, another student. "It's biased!"
Ms. Shuman was offering a lesson that went beyond learning to identify A.I. bias. She was using ChatGPT to give her pupils a message that artificial intelligence was not inevitable and that the young women had the insights to challenge it.
"Should your teachers be using ChatGPT?" Ms. Shuman asked toward the end of the lesson.
The students' answer was a resounding "No!" At least for now.

Value Stocks? Growth Stocks? It's All Topsy-Turvy.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Sommer, Jeff

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With the exception of Apple, eight tech giants are no longer "pure growth" stocks, while Exxon and Chevron are, a new study says. Our columnist says: Buyer, beware.
It is impossible even to talk about the long bull market that ended in January 2022 without saying high-growth tech stocks propelled the market higher.
Companies like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla dominated the headlines for years. Tech stocks and growth stocks were virtually synonymous.
But not anymore.
The new growth stocks, in the estimation of S&P Dow Jones Indices, an influential market analysis firm, now include fossil-fuel energy companies.
The world has changed radically in the last year or two, and traditional categories, like growth and value, are topsy-turvy.
S&P Dow Jones Indices handles the plumbing behind the two most famous American stock market indexes -- the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average -- and many other important world market benchmarks.
In an annual review of the S&P 500 index, it has found that the seemingly immutable connections between tech and growth, and between energy and value, in the stock market have weakened, if not snapped entirely.
The Findings
Investors have often viewed growth and value stocks as two essential categories. Basically, growth stocks promise a lot in the future but deliver less right now. Value stocks, on the other hand, aren't usually trendy. They are priced well below what their advocates consider to be their real worth.
But which stocks belong in each category? The answer seemed obvious, until the stock market collapsed in 2022. The prices of tech companies were shriveling, and they pulled the entire market down.
Now, using strictly mathematical measures, S&P Dow Jones Indices has found that Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft are no longer "pure growth" stocks. They have been replaced in the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index by an unlikely group: fossil-fuel companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
These conclusions are a startling sign of how much the world and its financial markets have been battered in the last year or two.
Until the S&P Indices findings, for example, Exxon and Chevron had been almost universally classified as value stocks. In the thinking that prevailed a couple of years ago, an urgent need to address global warming impaired the long-term viability of fossil fuel companies. Even among investors who favored their shares, these firms were presumed to be a good value precisely because they were so unfashionable.
Last year, at least, those assumptions about growth and value stocks were overturned, along with many other presumptions about the world.
The World Changed
Russia's yearlong war in Ukraine set off a series of unanticipated shocks that elevated world oil and gas prices. Energy prices have come down a bit, but still remain high.
Publicly traded energy companies had outsize gains in sales, profits and stock prices. Exxon and Chevron have both reported record profits for last year. The S&P 500 dropped more than 18 percent in 2022, but energy was the only sector to rise, with an eye-popping total return of almost 67 percent, including dividends. The sector's sales, price and earnings momentum transformed its biggest components into growth stocks, at least in the backward-looking lens used by S&P 500 Indices.
At the same time, the eight big tech companies stumbled, for idiosyncratic reasons, as well as systemic ones. Tesla, for example, faces serious competition in the market for electric vehicles, even as the Twitter escapades of its proprietor, Elon Musk, may be turning off some would-be car buyers. Meta reported a continuing decline in sales and earnings on Wednesday, though its stock soared on plans for further share buybacks, amid a broad stock market rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases were abating. Still, the scale of its unprofitable investments in virtual reality have worried many investors. Netflix, which once said it competed only with sleep for the attention of its subscribers, now jousts with a horde of streaming companies.
But, in broad terms, two real-world factors are responsible for their reclassification this year. First, while the initial, lockdown phase of the Covid-19 pandemic generally increased tech firms' sales and profits in 2020 and 2021, it set them up for a sharp decline in their growth rates in 2022 as the economy recovered.
Second, soaring inflation and rising interest rates -- the Fed raised short-term rates again on Wednesday -- hurt the tech companies, too. Why? Basically because tech companies that entice investors with the mere promise of future sales and profits are worth less when the costs of waiting for those promises rise.
In short, the abrupt reversal of the eight big tech companies' momentum last year changed their profiles, according to the S&P Indices algorithms. Now, the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index includes just one: Apple. Despite periodic setbacks like the decline in sales and earnings it announced on Thursday, it has for the most part kept growing.
How are the others classified? The answer isn't simple. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft now reside in both of the two, more inclusive, S&P 500 growth and value indexes: subsets of the S&P 500 that welcome stocks near the middle of the growth-value spectrum. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla are only in the broad growth index, implying that they have retained more growth characteristics than Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft.
The shifts are dizzying. They amount to a wholesale transformation of nearly a third of the market weight of the S&P 500 growth and value indexes. "That's the biggest turnover since the start of current measurement methods in 2009," Hamish Preston, director of U.S. Equity for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview.
The Implications
In decision-making, it helps if you know what you're talking about. But when it comes to growth and value stocks, it's not easy to know.
Growth funds based on the S&P 500 indexes now contain fossil-fuel energy stocks, and if you thought that by holding those funds you were owning tech stocks, you may be disappointed. Funds based on other indexes, like the Russell 1000 Growth index, haven't yet rebalanced their holdings this year, and they still look more like traditional growth stock funds. Buyer beware.
Be careful in evaluating the horse races that have gone on for decades. Depending on the index, a stock that had been a growth champion may suddenly be running under the livery of value. These shifting labels raise questions, to say the least, about the enduring worth of such distinctions.
At the level of individual companies, finer distinctions can be made. There is a well-tested, disciplined value-investing approach used in analyzing stocks, one taught by Benjamin Graham at Columbia, and practiced by his star student, Warren Buffett.
But unless you make a living with this method, I'd say that this year's exercise by S&P Indices is invaluable in pointing out the pitfalls of choosing value or growth or any sector in broad bets on the markets. If fossil fuel energy stocks are growth companies in a warming world, what do those words even mean?
As an investor, I try to sidestep such judgments entirely. You can do that, too, by owning a piece of the entire stock and bond markets through broad, low-cost index funds that don't give a greater weight to one style or sector. If you have enough money to pay the bills, just let these investments mature over decades.
With that approach, you can observe the ever-changing spectacle of the markets without worrying about their sometimes tenuous relationship with common sense.
For my own peace of mind, I don't worry about shifting growth and value distinctions. I hold the entire market, and get on with other things.

Name: Poppy Liu
Age: 32
Hometown: Xi’an, China
Now Lives: In a three-bedroom ranch-style home on the East Side of Los Angeles with their partner, Jonah Tucker.
Claim to Fame: Poppy Liu is a first-generation Chinese American actor who plays Kiki, a sassy private blackjack dealer in the HBO series “Hacks.” Although Liu’s characters do not always identify as nonbinary or queer, “if they cast me in it, I’m like, ‘Well, this character is a little bit queer now,’” said Lui, who uses “they” for a pronoun. “I think the essence of who you are is always present, and I really embrace that.” They are also a doula to women of color and transgender people, and founded Collective Sex, a queer production company dedicated to inclusive stories about sex and healing.
Big Break: After graduating from Colgate University in 2009, Liu moved to New York City and landed various roles in downtown theater. In 2019, a casting call for “Sunnyside,” an immigration sitcom created by Kal Penn, led to the part of Mei Lin, a Chinese billionaire’s daughter. “I didn’t always see the stories that represent the people that I care about,” they said. “So, having my first experience on this incredible show with this ensemble became like a mini family.”
Latest Project: They recently played Mitzi, the spoiled daughter of a mafia boss, in the Hulu romantic thriller “Wedding Season.” But Liu’s focus has been on parenthood, after giving birth in December. “It happened really quickly, so I don’t know if I even had time to get existential about it,” they said.
Next Thing: Liu has a recurring role in Season 2 of “The Afterparty,” a murder-mystery comedy on Apple TV+, as well as on “American Born Chinese,” an action-comedy series on Disney+, in which they play Princess Iron Fan, “a celestial girlboss” who can be “emotionally manipulative.” While it’s hard to pick favorites, they are most excited about a role in “Dead Ringers,” a drama series on Amazon Prime Video. The character “is different than anything else I’ve done,” they said. “The whole tone of the show is quite dark, it’s very broody.”
Reproductive Fight: They serve on the board of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a group in Atlanta, and has helped a Mandarin-speaking patient who had a complex pregnancy. “I came on as her doula but ended up being her primary translator at the hospital as well,” they said.

Wall Street Slips After Strong Jobs Report: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks fell on Friday after the government reported a big jump in hiring last month, defying expectations for a slowdown and forcing investors to weigh the surprisingly strong labor market against their hopes that the fight against inflation could be approaching an end.
Friday's trading reflected the push-and-pull in markets in recent months, turbulence that has come amid competing narratives about the prospects for inflation, growth and interest rates. The S&P 500 initially fell after the jobs numbers were released, then regained almost all the lost ground later in the morning, before tumbling again in the afternoon.
The index ended the day down 1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 1.6 percent. Despite Friday's losses, the S&P 500 gained 1.6 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq composite gained 3.3 percent.
The Federal Reserve is trying to tamp down inflation by raising interest rates, without going so far that it pushes the economy into a recession. Higher rates raise borrowing costs for consumers and companies, which investors have seen as bad for stocks. Fed policymakers have said they would be comfortable pausing rate increases only when they could see clear signs that price pressures were waning as a result of the economy's cooling. On Wednesday, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the central bank would continue to raise rates until inflation was under control, adding that "a couple more" rate increases were being discussed.
But the jobs data released Friday showed a still-hot labor market, with U.S. employers adding 517,000 positions on a seasonally adjusted basis, an increase from 260,000 in December and more than twice what economists had expected. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, its lowest level since 1969.
"In order for inflation to come all the way down, one of the things that needs to happen is the labor market needs to weaken," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.While the employment numbers are a testament to the continued strength of the economy, the labor market has also been stoking inflation. Demand for workers has pushed up wage growth and, in turn, increased prices for consumers. In January, average hourly earnings rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier, a slowdown in the pace of gains from December but still higher than what the Fed had suggested it would be comfortable with.
The government also released data this week showing that the number of posted jobs per available unemployed worker -- a measure that policymakers have been watching closely -- rose again in December.
"These strong job numbers, while very good for the economy, adds to this concern that inflation and higher prices are going to continue to be an issue," said Eric Beiley, executive managing director of Steward Partners Global Advisory.
An ideal situation for stock investors would be a strong labor market that wasn't accompanied by rapidly rising prices. That would spur consumer spending and bolster corporate profits.
The broad market was also weighed down Friday by drops in shares of several large technology companies, after their earnings reports earlier in the week. Amazon tumbled 8.4 percent, after it reported on Thursday almost no profit for the latest quarter. Alphabet dropped 2.8 percent after reporting its fourth consecutive decline in profit amid a slowdown in digital advertising.
Meta, which had its biggest rally in almost 10 years on Thursday, the day after the company beat analysts' expectations for revenue in its latest quarterly earnings report, fell about 1.2 percent on Friday. Shares of Apple were up about 2.4 percent.
Beyond the stock market, trading in government bond yields showed investors adjusting their expectations for interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for mortgages and many other types of loans, rose to 3.53 percent, retracing some of this year's decline. And the yield on the two-year note, which closely tracks expectations for Fed policy, jumped to 4.30 percent.

Baby Ruby: [Review]

Full text: This psychological horror movie stars Noémie Merlant as a new mother experiencing delusions and paranoia.
As moody and messy as its eponym, "Baby Ruby" aspires to demonstrate how postpartum psychosis can feel like a horror movie. It just fails to make the condition feel like a particularly convincing or cohesive horror movie.
The film begins with Jo (Noémie Merlant), a successful blogger, throwing her own baby shower at the chic upstate cabin she shares with her husband, Spencer (Kit Harington). Jo makes it plain that she intends to be a modern mommy who has it all: the affectionate marriage, the elegant home, the prosperous career and the angelic baby.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the weeks after she delivers Ruby, however, Jo experiences an onset of delusions and paranoia. Ruby is a colicky baby, and as Jo strives to summon up soothing techniques, she seesaws between the compulsive urge to safeguard the infant and the uncomfortable sensation of begrudging her existence.
It was once considered taboo to even suggest that new motherhood was not all sunshine onesies and rainbow mobiles, and "Baby Ruby" arrives on a welcome wave of contemporary movies exploring how the joys of child rearing can commingle with misery.
Yet the film, directed by Bess Wohl, often defaults to telling us about these emotional states rather than showing them. We learn that Jo is a control freak only through quarrels with Spencer's overbearing mother (Jayne Atkinson) and chit chats with her new pal (Meredith Hagner, a riot offering respite from the gloom). Retro visual flair, such as repeat cuts and mirror effects, add some aesthetic interest to Jo's spiraling. But "Baby Ruby" hardly whimpers, let alone screams.

Home Buyers Inch Back as Rates Fall: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.09 percent this week, the lowest in five months. Buyers are returning, but experts say the state of the economy will drive the market's next moves.
Earlier in the pandemic, when many urbanites were leaving New York to work remotely in far-flung locations, Molly Parker Wade instead moved from the West Coast to Brooklyn to be closer to her family.
After a year of renting, Ms. Wade, a 35-year-old public relations executive for Amazon, was ready to buy, just as the cost of home loans began to climb sharply. Late last year, mortgage rates hit a two-decade high, putting a chill on the housing market -- and her buying plans.
"I spent 2022 learning about mortgages," she said.
Undeterred by high rates, Ms. Wade closed on a $ 975,000 one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights in December. "It felt like the right thing to do at the right time," she said.
Home buyers are edging back into the market after being sidelined last year by a jump in borrowing costs and soaring housing prices. Although mortgage rates are coming down -- the average rate on the most common home loan fell to a five-month low this week, making purchases relatively more affordable -- real estate experts say what matters more for buyers and sellers now is the state of the economy, which is especially hard to gauge.
"It's jobs, jobs, jobs," said Sam Khater, the chief economist at the mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac. Although the economy is solid, "if all these recession forecasts come to fruition, it would be a big deal," he added.
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the government reported last week, as Americans continued to spend despite stubbornly high inflation. The International Monetary Fund projected this week that the U.S. economy would slow this year and the jobless rate would rise, but that there was "a narrow path that allows the U.S. economy to escape a recession altogether or, if it has a recession, the recession would be relatively shallow," according to the organization's chief economist.
As part of their effort to tame rising consumer prices, Federal Reserve policymakers raised interest rates again on Wednesday, by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 4.5 to 4.75 percent, the eighth increase in 11 months. Fed officials are trying to slow the economy enough to bring inflation back under control, without inducing a severe recession.
"Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates," the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said after the central bank's announcement.
The Fed's actions have helped cool the once-hot housing market, but mortgage rates have recently started to fall again -- partly on investors' expectations that the central bank's campaign of rate increases is nearing an end -- which could spur more activity in the housing market. New-home sales, which are particularly sensitive to changes in mortgage rates, rose 2.3 percent in December from the month before, the Census Bureau reported last week.
Because stronger economic growth could lead the Fed to raise rates higher, and keep them elevated longer, home buyers and sellers face a tricky balance of their confidence in the economy and what that might mean for borrowing costs. They, like Fed officials, would like to see a so-called soft landing, in which the economy cools in such a way that inflation moderates but doesn't slow so much that it makes big-ticket purchases like a home more daunting than it already is.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.09 percent this week, Freddie Mac reported on Thursday, down from 6.13 percent the week before. Rates had climbed to 7.08 percent in October, the highest level since 2002.
Falling mortgage costs "will generally boost demand a little bit because more folks will be able to buy," said Nicole Bachaud, senior economist at Zillow, a site that estimates home values. But she cautioned that home prices, which have been ticking lower on a monthly basis, remained high because owners who had locked in low rates years ago had little incentive to sell now.
"We will be seeing prices fall for the next few months, but that will be minimal," she said, predicting a price decline of 1 to 2 percent nationally in the coming year.
More homes are being sold at or below list price, but many sellers are not budging, Ms. Bachaud said. New listings have slowed to a trickle, and homes are staying on the market longer. Sales of existing homes fell 1.5 percent in December, the 11th consecutive monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Industry watchers say reluctant owners will be more likely to put their homes on the market if average mortgage rates fall another half a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
"Five and a half is where people get really comfortable," said Nicole Rueth, a senior vice president at OneTrust Home Loans, a lender based in Denver. Until then, she added, owners will be motivated to sell by personal circumstances: "I'm having a baby, I'm getting married, I need to downsize, I need to move for my job."
For Jessica Grupp, buying a home coincided with the end of her active duty in the Navy. She had been renting in San Diego, and she wanted to stay after she finished her service. "I've wanted to buy here for a while," she said.
As the market cooled and conditions became favorable again, Ms. Grupp, 33, found a two-bedroom apartment in the city's University Heights neighborhood. Her offer of $ 640,000 -- $ 10,000 below the asking price -- was accepted, and she moved in with her dog, Kanna, in October.
Now a consultant for PwC, Ms. Grupp is happy she bided her time. "For me, it was finding a place that fit my lifestyle and budget," she said.
More stories like hers would be welcomed by the real estate industry, which struggled last year as the market slowed down. Several online brokerage firms -- including Compass, Redfin and Zillow -- have laid off workers. Redfin and Zillow have closed their house-flipping businesses. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is reportedly in talks with the commercial real estate data provider CoStar to sell Move, a digital real estate business that includes Realtor.com and related sites.
"Home sales are probably bottoming out now or will in the first quarter this year," said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. The resilient economy, solid job market and low levels of mortgage defaults are among the reasons the housing market is stabilizing, he said, and he predicted that mortgage rates would slide to 5.5 percent by late spring or early summer.
"Stability is good, especially in light of the big changes that occurred in the past three years," he said.

Apple Revenue and Profit Down as iPhone Sales Slow

Full text: Enlarge this image.
When a COVID-19 outbreak in China forced a lockdown of Apple’s largest iPhone factory in November, the world’s most valuable company warned investors that it would lose sales. The question was: How much?
On Thursday, Apple reported that revenue fell 5% to $117.15 billion during the three months that ended in December , the company’s first quarterly sales decline since before the pandemic. Profits decreased 13% to $30 billion.
Apple’s results are the latest evidence of the challenges buffeting the tech industry. After recording double-digit sales gains during the early pandemic, companies have recently shifted to cost cutting and mass layoffs, with Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet — Google’s parent company — each eliminating at least 10,000 jobs.
A less severe whiplash has hit Apple. From 2020 to 2022, the company increased its annual revenue by nearly $125 billion. But demand for iPhones, iPads and Macs has slowed, causing investors to sour on the company. Over the course of a year, Apple lost $1 trillion in market value, a stunning reversal for the only U.S. company to ever reach a valuation of $3 trillion.
The company’s shares declined about 4% in after-hours trading, reversing most of the gains from earlier in the day when tech shares rallied following Meta’s earnings report Wednesday. Wall Street had expected $122 billion in sales and $31 billion in profit.
Though its business has slowed, Apple hasn’t moved to cut jobs. Unlike some of its peers, such as Google and Meta, which aggressively hired during the first years of the pandemic to keep up with demand, Apple remained disciplined, adding 24,000 new workers, just 3,000 more than it added in the three years before 2020.
Still, many investors have reduced their stakes in Apple out of concern its business will be hit by the slowing economy. Consumer spending in the United States, Apple’s largest market, has declined, posing a potential challenge to sales of pricey iPhones.
“It’s impacting the higher end consumer’s willingness to spend and that’s going to impact the most valuable company in the world,” said Dave Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which has about $5 billion under management and an investment in Apple.
Apple recorded $65.78 billion in iPhone sales, an 8% decline from the previous year. The modest decline testified to the company’s supply chain acumen. After the company shut down its biggest iPhone factory in November, it shifted some production to other factories, according to Counterpoint, a market research firm.
On the sales front, Apple benefited as more iPhone buyers chose its more expensive Pro models, lifting the average selling price 9% to $936, according to Counterpoint.
Apple offset its iPhone struggles with increased sales of its iPads and services. The company said its iPad business recorded $9.4 billion in sales, a 30% increase. It increased sales of apps and subscription services such as Apple Music to $20.77 billion, about 6% from the previous year.
The company’s biggest challenge remains its concentrated supply chain in China. The faltering of U.S.-China relations has accelerated, with Congress creating a special committee this year to evaluate competition with Beijing. Concerns are also mounting in Washington that China could soon take military action against Taiwan.
Amid the rising tensions, Apple has shifted production from China to Vietnam and India. But a vast majority of its revenue continues to come from products made in China. And Chinese consumers count for about one-fifth of total sales.
During the December period, sales in China fell 7% to $23.9 billion. Apple’s business there should improve in the current period as China’s economy reopens after years of strict COVID-19 restrictions. Analysts predict sales in the current quarter will decline about 4%. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ms. Wersching was best known for playing the Borg Queen on the Paramount+ "Star Trek" series. She was also on the television series "24," "Bosch" and "Timeless."
The actress Annie Wersching, best known for her roles in positions of authority on television series like "Star Trek: Picard," "24," "Bosch" and "Timeless," died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 45.
The cause was cancer, her publicist, Craig Schneider, said in a statement. He noted that even after Ms. Wersching was diagnosed in 2020, she continued her acting work, playing the Borg Queen on the second season of "Picard," a "Star Trek" spinoff on Paramount+, as well as the serial killer Rosalind Dyer on the ABC crime series "The Rookie."
Ms. Wersching was also known for playing Julia Brasher, a police officer on the Amazon series "Bosch," and Emma Whitmore, an engineer, on the NBC series "Timeless." On Fox's "24," about a counterterrorism team that protects the United States from potential attacks, she played the F.B.I. special agent Renee Walker, which she once called "a dream role."
"She gets to experience so much action and do so many stunts; she is so cool," Ms. Werschling told Alive St. Louis magazine in 2009. "Plus, I can relate to her; in real life, I'm not too much of a girly girl."
Ms. Wersching also provided the voice for the character Tess in The Last of Us, a 2013 video game that has recently been adapted into a television series on HBO, with Anna Torv as Tess.
In an interview on the Paramount+ show "The Ready Room," Ms. Wersching described playing the Borg Queen as "certainly a little intimidating." She noted that she had familiarized herself with the role and those who had previously played it before going forward with her own interpretation and performance. "It's such an iconic role," she said. "I'm incredibly excited to have everyone see."
Ms. Wersching was born on March 28, 1977, and raised in St. Louis. Her parents, Sandy and Frank Wersching, were involved in the local arts community. Her father died when she was 12.
Annie spent her youth competing in Irish dance with the St. Louis Celtic Stepdancers. She graduated from Crossroads College Preparatory School in 1995 and received a B.F.A. in musical theater from Millikin University in Decatur, Ill., in 1999. She had intended to make a career in theater but changed her mind after she was on tour with a musical in Los Angeles and went to a live taping of the sitcom "Stark Raving Mad."
"I thought, 'This is the best of both worlds -- they are performing like it's theater with the audience interaction, but you are on TV,"' she told Edge magazine. "This is the dream."
She moved to Los Angeles in 2001.
She is survived by her husband, Stephen Full, whom she married in 2009, and three children, Freddie, Ozzie and Archie Full.
"There is a cavernous hole in the soul of this family today," Mr. Full said in a statement. "But she left us the tools to fill it. She found wonder in the simplest moment. She didn't require music to dance. She taught us not to wait for adventure to find you."
Mr. Full noted that whenever he and his sons left their house, Ms. Wersching would shout "Bye!" until they were out of earshot.
"I can still hear it ringing," he added.

Judge Says No to Effort To Block Meta V.R. Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The ruling is a defeat for the Federal Trade Commission, which used a rare antitrust argument to try to block Meta's acquisition of a small start-up.
A federal judge has rejected the Federal Trade Commission's request to stop Meta, Facebook's parent company, from buying a small virtual reality start-up, two people with knowledge of the matter said, signaling that efforts to rein in the tech giants may struggle in courts.
In a sealed order issued late Tuesday, Judge Edward J. Davila of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined the F.T.C.'s demand for a preliminary injunction to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual reality fitness game called Supernatural, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the orders are sealed.
Judge Davila also issued a restraining order blocking the $ 400 million deal from closing through Tuesday, allowing the F.T.C. time to decide whether it wants to appeal the ruling, one of the people said.
The loss is a stinging defeat for the F.T.C.'s chair, Lina Khan, and her broader efforts to expand the boundaries of antitrust law to better regulate the tech giants. The case was aimed at testing that line with a rarely used legal argument that Meta's deal would hinder future competition in an undeveloped market, as opposed to a more traditional case that would focus on a mature economic area.
Ms. Khan has argued that the F.T.C. should file more novel cases if it wants to properly nurture competition in the modern economy. She has acknowledged that the agency must be willing to lose in some of them.
The ruling is "a blow to the administration's and the F.T.C.'s interest in being stronger in merger enforcement," said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. She added that the agency clearly saw benefits to bringing risky cases to draw attention to what it considered the poor state of antitrust law.
The decision was a vindication for Meta, which had argued in court that it was trying to create a platform that would be welcoming for all virtual reality apps, including those developed independently. The company has invested billions of dollars in becoming a powerhouse of the so-called metaverse, where users work, play and consume content through virtual and augmented reality. It has acquired virtual reality content studios and Oculus, a company that makes the headsets people use to view that content.
Meta, which reported a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge in its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, declined to comment. A spokesman for the F.T.C. said the agency was "not able to comment at this time" to respect the court's seal order.
Bloomberg earlier reported Judge Davila's decision.
The F.T.C. sued Meta in July in federal court to temporarily halt the deal, and then asked its in-house court in August to fully block the acquisition. The F.T.C. will have to decide whether to proceed with its in-house challenge despite the ruling.
The lawsuit was the first of the cases developed entirely under Ms. Khan, a legal scholar who rose to prominence after she wrote a critique of Amazon that went viral, to be filed in court. Looking to prevent more "vertical" deals, in which the two companies don't compete directly, the F.T.C. also challenged Microsoft's $ 69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard in December. Last month, the Department of Justice accused Google of abusing a monopoly over the technology that places ads on websites.
William E. Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chairman, said the sealed ruling in the Meta case would be more problematic for the agency if the judge panned the legal theories underpinning the challenge. But if Judge Davila saw the F.T.C.'s more novel approach as plausible -- even if the agency's factual assertions were weak in this case -- "that's a low-impact defeat" less likely to hurt its future efforts, Mr. Kovacic said.
The case was heard in San Jose, Calif., in December. During the seven-day hearing, Meta's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, testified. The F.T.C. argued that if Meta did not buy Supernatural, it would develop its own virtual reality fitness game.
Meta's case rested on proving that developing or acquiring a fitness app was just a small part of a strategy that would eventually push virtual reality, and by extension the metaverse, into wide popularity.
During the hearing, an F.T.C. lawyer asked Mr. Zuckerberg if it was true that acquiring or developing a fitness app kept him up at night. Fitness apps, Mr. Zuckerberg said, were just one type of app that the company was interested in.
"Fitness was probably the fourth or fifth use case that I thought would be important," he said, ranking apps that focused on gaming, productivity and social interactions as higher priorities. Developing a fitness app, he told the lawyer, did not cost him any sleep.
Mr. Zuckerberg also told Judge Davila that if he blocked the deal, it would "have a chilling effect."
"Maybe Meta gets banned from everything going forward," Mr. Zuckerberg said. "That would make it so investors are less excited for investing in this space."

Full text: The departure of Madeline McIntosh, who has led the country's largest book publisher since 2018, is the latest shake-up for the company during a turbulent period.
Madeline McIntosh, one of the most powerful figures in American book publishing, is stepping down from her role as chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., the company announced on Tuesday.
The announcement comes during a time of great turbulence for Penguin Random House, by far the country's largest book publisher. Markus Dohle, who was the chief executive of Penguin Random House, and McIntosh's boss, resigned from his position in December.
The company also lost a bid last year to buy Simon & Schuster, a large rival publishing house, after the government successfully sued to stop the deal on antitrust grounds. The deal's collapse cost Penguin Random House a $ 200 million termination fee, in addition to enormous legal costs. Dohle had overseen the attempted acquisition.
McIntosh has been the head of Penguin Random House U.S. since 2018. Before that, she held a variety of roles at the company, which she first joined almost 30 years ago. She also worked briefly at Amazon.
Her departure was reported earlier in The Wall Street Journal.
In a memo to the company's staff, McIntosh said she would not leave right away but would work with Nihar Malaviya, the interim chief executive of Penguin Random House, to ensure an orderly transition. She said she had no concrete plans for what to do next.
In an interview on Tuesday, she said that even though five years might seem like a short tenure as chief executive, it had been "an intense five years."
"I don't like the idea of sticking in one spot or doing one job forever," she said.
McIntosh said that the collapse of the merger didn't influence her decision to step down, but that after the trial's conclusion, she felt ready to embark on a new phase of her career. "It's a really good inflection point for the company as well as for me," she said. "Having the trial behind us, having new leadership in place, it's a good time for all of us to pivot our way forward."
In a memo to the company, Malaviya acknowledged that "changes like this naturally create unease." He said he would move as quickly as possible to name a successor and would try to minimize disruptions to the company and its employees.
At trial last year, as Penguin Random House defended its bid to buy Simon & Schuster, the company revealed it had been losing market share in recent years and that it hoped that acquiring Simon & Schuster would help to recover some of the lost ground. With that deal off the table, Penguin Random House will have to find another way to expand.
There were also signs of tension between the company's top executives at the trial. During his testimony, Dohle was asked about a comment he made to colleagues that Penguin Random House had messed up its products following the 2013 merger, and complaints he had made about there being too many layers of management.
The company remains a hugely powerful force in the business. It publishes acclaimed literary novelists like Kazuo Ishiguro and Colson Whitehead, blockbuster commercial authors like Dan Brown and E L James, and children's classics by Eric Carle and Dr. Seuss. This month, it said that Prince Harry's memoir, "Spare," sold more than 1.43 million copies in the U.S., Canada and Britain on its first day, including presales.
But shortly after that book's release, another longtime executive said she was leaving the company. Gina Centrello, the president of Random House, the division that published "Spare," announced she was retiring.
Throughout her long career in publishing, McIntosh has shown a canny ability to adapt to technological change, a striking quality in an industry that's not known for being cutting edge. She got her start in publishing as a temporary assistant to an editor at HarperCollins, then found a permanent position at Norton. In 1994, she joined Bantam Doubleday Dell, a division of Bertelsmann, in the company's new media development, and later was put in charge of online sales.
In time, she became the head of Random House Audio, which also became a fast-growing format. She shocked many in the industry when she took a job at Amazon in 2008, as the director of content for the international rollout of its e-reader. That job, she said, convinced her that publishing needed to be more technologically savvy to thrive.
She returned to Random House a year and a half later, as the president of sales, operations and digital, and later became the company's chief executive in the United States.
As the head of the company's U.S. business, McIntosh stood out from many of her peers at other major publishing houses. In an industry that has a reputation for being old-fashioned and relationship-driven, McIntosh was known for being more detached, analytical and data driven.
Her tenure was not always smooth: McIntosh oversaw some unpopular changes, including merging publishing divisions and closing imprints, driving out some influential editors who were known as tastemakers. Among them were Molly Stern, as well as Julie Grau and Cindy Spiegel, who started their own independent publishing companies, becoming competitors of Penguin Random House.
McIntosh said she has not yet made any decisions about what she'll pursue next, or whether she will remain in the publishing business. "What I'm really itching to do is to try something new and different," she said.
Although some see worrying signs of stagnation in the industry, she said, she sees potential for a surge in innovation, particularly in digital sales and marketing.
"We're at a really interesting period where the consumers have proved that they want books," she said, "and the opportunities are there for us to grab in terms of thinking of new and ever more innovative ways to connect them with books."

Pontiff Travels to a Country Vast in Resources but Wrecked by Conflict: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The pope is planning to spend three days in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the most populous and most Catholic nations in Africa. While it has extensive natural riches, its people have long been buffeted by conflict and exploitation.
With immense mineral wealth and fertile land, a large, youthful population, and a territory about the size of Western Europe, the Democratic Republic of Congo should be the economic engine of Africa and a global power.
But the country, sometimes called Africa's "sleeping giant," has been hobbled by a bloody legacy of colonialism, drawn-out wars, decades of mismanagement of public funds and a chronic lack of infrastructure. Pope Francis had planned to travel to eastern Congo, but an escalation in the relentless fighting by militia groups there -- which has cost millions of lives over the course of the conflict -- prompted him to stick to the capital in the west, Kinshasa.
The country was set up to fail, many historians say, by its colonizing power, Belgium, which for decades ruled Congo with an iron fist, extracting its vast natural wealth. Belgium left abruptly after independence in 1960, denying Congo the transition period its leaders had asked for.
Just before his assassination in 1961, Patrice Lumumba, the independence leader who served as Congo's first prime minister, wrote in his final letter to his wife: "I want my children, whom I leave behind and perhaps will never see again, to be told that the future of the Congo is beautiful."
More than half a century later, Congo is still striving to attain his vision.
It's home to a vast rainforest known as one of the world's lungs.
Most of the Congo rainforest, almost 500 million acres of biodiverse tropical forests and carbon-rich peatlands, is in Congo. (The rest is spread across its neighbors.) Second only to the Amazon, the Congo rainforest removes vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere -- one study estimated its worth at $ 55 billion per year.
The rainforest and peatlands face multiple threats -- from loggers, charcoal makers, and, most recently, the Congolese government, which announced last year that it would auction off oil blocks that overlap with protected areas. Congo recently granted three North American companies the rights to develop gas blocks under Lake Kivu.
Though parts of it are fast disappearing, vast tracts of the rainforest are still undisturbed.
Congo is rich in rare and precious minerals.
With gold, copper, diamonds, coltan and what is believed to be two-thirds of the globe's cobalt -- a key ingredient in electric car batteries -- Congo is considered by experts to be one of the world's richest countries, in terms of minerals.
And competition for them is fierce. As the world begins the transition away from fossil fuels, cobalt has become extremely valuable. China and the United States have been racing to gain control over the global supply.
Almost all of Congo's gold ends up in the hands of regional powers including Rwanda and Uganda -- smuggled out, refined and then exported to international markets, especially to the United Arab Emirates, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Rwanda and Uganda have denied the accusations.
The rush to reap Congo's wealth has led to exploitation of mine workers, violence against the local communities and proxy warfare -- particularly in the country's east.
People in the east face escalating violence and instability.
Conflict has gripped the east for decades, with more than 100 armed groups and their alphabet soup of acronyms -- including the A.D.F., the F.D.L.R., the L.N.R. and CODECO -- killing, raping, and displacing 5.5 million people, according to the United Nations. Refugees from Congo have for years been fleeing to other countries in Africa, and to Europe, Canada and the United States.
But recently, a militia group called the M23 has been driving a new wave of violence, carrying out massacres and causing hundreds of thousands to flee, many heading for the lakeside city of Goma. There, tiny tents made of tarpaulin and duct tape now fill the landscape, providing pitiful shelter to their occupants, who are often small children and their traumatized mothers.
Congo says Rwanda is backing the M23, and the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, has accused the country of "expansionist tendencies." Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame -- long a darling of the West, his country a major recipient of U.S. aid money -- denies supporting the militia. But U.N. experts have published credible evidence that Rwanda exercises "overall command and strategic planning" of M23, arming it and helping with recruitment.
The hostilities, which have roots in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, have escalated in recent weeks as Rwanda fired at a Congolese military jet that it said violated its airspace.
Congo's Catholic church is politically powerful.
Congo's Roman Catholic Church -- the biggest in Africa -- exerts a powerful force in the country's democracy.
Since the 1990s, the church has been instrumental in trying to hold the country's leaders to account. After Mass on Sundays, congregations across the country sometimes march straight from church to demonstrations, making it more difficult for the authorities to ban protests, or crack down on them. Over the years, protesters have taken to the streets over a president's unconstitutional attempt to run for a third term, and demanded fresh elections and an end to the war in the east.
At election time, the church sends observers to polling stations across the country -- 40,000 of them in the last election -- to check that the polls run smoothly and report any attempts to disrupt proceedings or tamper with results.
The last time Congo went to the polls to choose a new president, in December of 2018, the Catholic Church announced that there was a clear winner. Though it stopped short of saying who won, experts agreed that it was Martin Fayulu, the leading opposition candidate. But Mr. Fayulu did not become president, and neither did the ruling party's candidate, handpicked by the then-president, Joseph Kabila. Instead, another opposition figure, Mr. Tshisekedi, took power -- backed by Mr. Kabila.
Another election is set to take place this December. President Tshisekedi and Mr. Fayulu are expected to once more enter the race.

Thrive Capital Said to Commit Funds to Stripe: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Thrive has committed $ 1 billion, which would value the payments provider Stripe at about $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Thrive Capital, the investment firm founded by Joshua Kushner, is leading a potential investment in the payments provider Stripe at a valuation of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion, down sharply from two years ago, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Stripe is aiming to raise roughly $ 2.5 billion, one of the people said. Thrive has committed $ 1 billion, said another person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.
If completed, the funding could give Stripe breathing room amid a tough market for public listings. The money is expected to be used to pay the start-up's tax liabilities and to allow its employees to sell their company shares. Many privately held tech companies use stock options to help recruit employees, but a faltering market for public offerings has made it difficult for employees to cash out of those shares. Some Stripe employees have stock grants that will start expiring next year if the company does not go public or raise new funding, a person familiar with the situation said.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Stripe had considered raising new funds.
Stripe's moves are being scrutinized because it was once the most highly valued private company in the United States. How it responds to an inhospitable market for public offerings could be a harbinger for how others manage it.
The company, which the brothers John and Patrick Collison founded in 2010, hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to advise it on a potential public listing in the next year. It told employees last week that it was considering multiple routes to letting its employees cash out within 12 months.
Among the options is listing Stripe's shares on the public market. Another is to raise money privately followed by a tender offer, in which the company would sell employee shares to other investors while staying private. The new funding does not mean a public listing is off the table, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said.
A valuation of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion would be a steep drop for a company that last raised money at a roughly $ 95 billion valuation in 2021. Stripe sells payment processing software to companies including Peloton, Wayfair and Amazon.
Over the last year, the start-up funding environment has deteriorated amid rising interest rates and a renewed focus on profits. Some tech companies have found it harder to attract new investments and many start-ups have had to cut their costs.
For Thrive, known for its investments in start-ups like Skims, Warby Parker and SpaceX, a $ 1 billion bet is a big check. Mr. Kushner has been trying to steer the firm out of the shadow of his older brother, Jared, who was a top adviser to his father-in-law, former President Donald J. Trump.
Thrive closed a $ 3 billion fund, its largest ever, last year. Last week, it announced that it had sold a minority stake in the firm to executives including Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, and Henry Kravis, a co-founder of private equity firm KKR. The deal valued Thrive at $ 5.3 billion. It is also in talks to invest in the artificial intelligence company OpenAI.

Layoffs by Email Are Cruel and Unnecessary: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently announced that it would lay off around 12,000 people, 6 percent of its work force. Employees who were let go, some of whom had worked for the company for decades, got the news in their inboxes. "It's hard for me to believe that after 20 years at #Google I unexpectedly find out about my last day via an email," a Google engineer, Jeremy Joslin, tweeted. "What a slap in the face."
That sting is becoming an all-too-common sensation. In the last few years, tens of thousands of people have been laid off by email at tech and digital media companies, including Twitter, Amazon, Meta and Vox. The backlash from affected employees has been swift.
Employees at a tech company called PagerDuty received notices last week that set a new low bar for a layoff announcement, starting off with a few hundred words of cheery blather and rounding out with a Martin Luther King Jr. quotation about overcoming adversity.
It's not just tech and media. Companies in a range of industries claim this is the only efficient way to do a lot of layoffs. Informing workers personally is too complicated, they say -- and too risky, as people might use their access to internal systems to perform acts of sabotage. (These layoff emails are often sent to employees' personal email; by the time they check it, they've been locked out of all their employer's platforms.)
As someone who's managed people in newsrooms and digital start-ups and has hired and fired people in various capacities for the past 21 years, I think this approach is not just cruel but unnecessary. It's reasonable to terminate access to company systems, but delivering the news with no personal human contact serves only one purpose: letting managers off the hook. It ensures they will not have to face the shock and devastation that people feel when they lose their livelihoods. It also ensures the managers won't have to weather any direct criticism about the poor leadership that brought everyone to that point.
Legally, companies have plenty of recourse if laid-off employees steal trade secrets or sabotage systems, and employees who need to find new jobs have little incentive to behave criminally, no matter how upset they may be. But even so, concerns about liability shouldn't preclude treating employees like human beings.
Some defenders of the practice argue that there's simply no way to coordinate these things at such large scales, but that, too, rings hollow. There is no rule that all layoffs have to happen simultaneously. If managers interact directly with their workers in everyday business, there's no reason to believe that would suddenly be impossible when it's time to lay them off.
The first time I had to fire someone, I was 25, and it was for cause. In theory, firing people because they're underperforming or insubordinate should be easier than when they're doing a good job and the company simply can't sustain its payroll, but this time it wasn't. I felt nauseated going into the meeting, and when the person I was firing began tearing up in the middle of the conversation, I had no idea what to do. I stammered and apologized, and by the end of the meeting, the person I was firing was comforting me.
Since then, I've hired and trained first-time managers and taught them how to do this in a way that respects the dignity of the people who are losing their jobs: Look people in the eye. Answer questions. If someone is upset, show some sympathy. Treat people the way we would wish to be treated. At the very least this demands an actual human conversation. It is more effort than sending a platitude-laden mass email, but it demonstrates respect.
In the case of good employees who are being let go through no fault of their own, those conversations benefit the employer, too, because people remember how they're treated in their lowest moments -- and word spreads fast. Future hiring prospects will be reading all about it on Twitter or Glassdoor. In a tight labor market, a company's cruelty can leave a lasting stain on its reputation.
Perhaps the most appalling aspect of termination by email is the asymmetry between what corporations expect of their workers and how they treat them in return. Employees in all kinds of jobs are routinely pressed to give the maximum that they can. In low-wage service jobs it can mean insane, unpredictable hours with no benefits. At higher-paying tech jobs it can mean sacrificing any semblance of a life outside the office, a requirement that is often justified by high-minded rhetoric about changing the world or the promise of some pot-of-gold reward in an unspecified future.
The expectation that an employee give at least a two-week notice and help with transition is rooted in a sense that workers owe their employers something more than just their labor: stability, continuity, maybe even gratitude for the compensation they've earned.
But when it's the company that chooses to end the relationship, there is often no such requirement. The same people whose labor helped build the company get suddenly recoded as potential criminals who might steal anything that's not nailed down.
At Twitter, where Elon Musk has embraced managerial incompetence as if it were an emerging art form that requires great creativity, employees were asked to sign a pledge to be "hard core," working even longer hours and sleeping in the office if necessary. Unsurprisingly, many instead decided to preserve their family lives and self-respect.
For them, this was just the first indignity. Many terminated employees found that their severance offers didn't materialize for months -- and some were called back to work when it turned out the site couldn't run without them. One employee who early on went to LinkedIn to write "Elon's my new boss and I'm stoked!" reportedly didn't make it through the first round of layoffs.
Approval of unions is already at 71 percent. Dehumanizing workers like this is accelerating the trend. Once unthinkable, unionization at large tech companies now seems all but inevitable.
Treating employees like disposable units who can simply be unsubscribed to ultimately endangers a company's own interests. It seems mistreated workers know their value, even if employers -- as they are increasingly prone to demonstrate -- do not.

Bracing for Key Decisions, Markets Fall: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks sank Monday as Wall Street prepared for a week full of potentially market-moving events, from decisions on interest rates around the world to earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies.
The S&P 500 dropped 1.3 percent, giving back some of the gains that had carried it last week to its highest level since early December. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 260 points, or 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq composite sank 2 percent.
Markets have been veering recently on worries that the economy and corporate profits may be set for a steep drop-off, along with competing hopes that cooling inflation will persuade the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates.
The central bank's next decision on rates is scheduled for Wednesday, and most investors expect the bank to announce an increase of just 0.25 percentage points. That would be the smallest increase since March, following a spate of increases of 0.75 points and then a 0.50-point increase, and it would mean less added pressure on the economy.
Higher rates combat inflation by intentionally slowing the economy, while also dragging down prices for investments. Inflation has been cooling since the summer amid last year's blizzard of rate increases, but the economy has also been showing signs of concern.
The big question is whether the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, will on Wednesday afternoon give markets what they want to hear -- hints that rate increases will end soon and that rate cuts may even be possible late this year -- or stick to the Fed's mantra that it plans to keep rates higher for longer, even if a modest recession hits.
"I think that they have no intention of cutting rates this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, adding that the Fed waits an average of roughly nine months after its last rate increase before cutting.
"They'll reiterate that they don't want to make the mistakes of the 1970s," he said, "but I think in the back of their minds, they're going to say no matter which inflationary indicator you look at, they're all heading in a stairstep downward pattern."
Central banks for Europe and for the United Kingdom are also set to announce their latest increases for rates this week.
Beyond interest rates, more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled this week to report how much profit they made in the last three months of 2022. Among them are the technology heavyweights Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company. Because these companies are three of the four biggest on Wall Street by market value, their stock movements carry much more sway on the S&P 500 than others.
Apple's 2 percent drop on Monday, for example, was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.
The only other stock that rivals Apple in size, Microsoft, shook Wall Street last week when it gave forecasts for upcoming results that raised worries about a slowdown in corporate spending on technology. Its stock fell 2.2 percent Monday.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 52.79 points to 4,017.77. The Dow lost 260.99 to 33,717.09, and the Nasdaq fell 227.90 to 11,393.81.
Strategists at Morgan Stanley led by Michael Wilson warned that tougher times may be ahead.
"The reality is that earnings are proving to be even worse than feared based on the data, especially as it relates to margins," they wrote in a report. "Secondly, investors seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of 'Don't Fight the Fed.' Perhaps this week will serve as a reminder."
Later this week, the U.S. government will also give its latest monthly update on the job market. Hiring has remained resilient across the broad economy, even as housing and other corners weaken sharply under the weight of all the Fed's rate increases.

'Buy Now, Pay Later' Model Is Facing a Crisis: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: What once seemed like attractive economics have been upended by increasing competition and rising interest rates.
Last Tuesday was a rough day for Goldman Sachs. The share price fell 6 percent after the Wall Street giant reported its worst earnings miss in a decade. On a call that morning, analysts peppered David Solomon, the bank's C.E.O., with questions about its consumer banking strategy, and about one unit in particular, GreenSky.
Goldman closed its $ 2.2 billion acquisition of GreenSky, a pioneer in the "buy now, pay later" (B.N.P.L.) lending sector, in March, calling it a key piece in its strategy to build "the consumer banking platform of the future." It flew under the radar until last quarter, the first in which Goldman broke out earnings for its "platform solutions" business unit, which includes GreenSky. The picture wasn't pretty. Revenues were up, but the division lost $ 1.66 billion in 2022.
Goldman's troubles with GreenSky are indicative of a cloud hanging over the sector. B.N.P.L. was one of the fastest-growing areas in financial technology for years, spawning Europe's most valuable start-up, Klarna, and promising to revolutionize how we consume and how banks could reach tech-savvy new market segments. The growth should continue; according to Worldpay, B.N.P.L. accounted for 3.8 percent of North American e-commerce transactions in 2021 and is projected to grow to 8.5 percent by 2025.
But what once seemed like attractive economics have been upended. B.N.P.L. providers rely on loans for the money that they lend to customers for free, and with rising interest rates, those loans have become more expensive. Passing higher costs onto customers may be difficult: Those who like the idea of paying for a jacket or a dishwasher in installments may not be willing to pay extra for the privilege.
The industry is now facing an existential crisis, as profits remain elusive, valuations plummet, competition increases and regulators ask tough questions about the lending practices behind B.N.P.L.
A victim of its own success
Klarna, the SoftBank-backed B.N.P.L. company, until recently was the largest start-up in Europe, with a valuation of $ 45.6 billion. The Swedish company, started in 2005, hit the U.S. market with a splash. It lined up Maya Rudolph, the former "Saturday Night Live" actress, for a 2021 Super Bowl ad (average cost: $ 5.5 million for a 30-second spot). That may have helped it make inroads into the United States, but it has since fallen on harder times. The company has slashed jobs, and its valuation has plummeted to $ 6.5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
"Candidly, 'buy now, pay later' is just a feature," David Sykes, Klarna's chief commercial officer, told DealBook. "If all you're doing is offering the ability to break a purchase up into installments, we don't think, long term, that's dynamic enough." Two of the other big global B.N.P.L. players, Affirm and Afterpay, have never turned an annual profit; Klarna says it was profitable in its early years.
What happened? Initially, the heaviest B.N.P.L. users were young women buying clothes and beauty products, and the option then grew among consumers of all ages, for any imaginable purpose or product. In the early days of the lockdown, Peloton exercise bikes were a popular purchase for B.N.P.L. customers. Ahead of its initial public offering in 2021, Affirm flagged its reliance on Peloton as a business risk, noting its biggest merchant partner accounted for more than a quarter of its revenue.
As B.N.P.L. has become more popular, however, more and more companies -- from American Express to Citibank to PayPal -- have muscled in. In June, Apple announced a plan to enter the market, although its rollout has been delayed until later this year. Increased competition is expected to drive down margins even further, as merchants drive harder bargains with the army of providers.
Regulators are ratcheting up scrutiny, too
At the same time, regulators are beginning to act on concerns about how B.N.P.L. providers handle late fees, customer privacy and disputes. Plans are underway to strengthen B.N.P.L. regulation this year in Britain, where some consumer rights campaigners complain the service is marketed as a benign payment option but is actually debt. And a September report by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau concluded that B.N.P.L. companies "are not providing the same rights and protections ... that credit card companies provide," according to a statement by the agency's director, Rohit Chopra.
For these and other reasons, public and private markets have punished B.N.P.L. companies. Affirm shares, for example, have fallen more than 90 percent from their November 2021 peak, in line with other unprofitable growth stocks, including Peloton.
Low valuations make B.N.P.L. companies acquisition targets for big banks, financial services companies, or an outside player such as Amazon or Apple. (Affirm has enjoyed its status as the exclusive B.N.P.L. provider to Amazon, but that agreement expires at the end of this month.) In 2021, Square (now Block) bought Australia's Afterpay for a hefty $ 30 billion; today a leading B.N.P.L. company could be purchased at half that price or less.
B.N.P.L. executives point out that markets often fluctuate wildly, and that as long as a business can control its unit economics, it has the basis to make a profit eventually. Still, they're building other types of businesses.
Mr. Sykes said Klarna was at least as focused on improving the overall shopping experience as it was on helping consumers pay for products. This means offering comparison shopping within the Klarna app, and providing discounts.
"We spend as much time now talking to the C.M.O.s of businesses as we do the C.F.O.s and the people who own the payments part," he said.
In Goldman's case, GreenSky targets customers with high credit scores who are paying for home improvement projects rather than small-ticket items, a spokesperson said.
Affirm offers other types of loans, such as monthly installments at 10 percent interest. A spokesperson for the company said B.N.P.L. was "the beginning of a whole new domain of products and even companies."
Jason Kupferberg, managing director in U.S. equity research at Bank of America, said that in the 2021 fiscal year, 43 percent of Affirm's loans were at zero interest. In the latest quarter, he said, only 36 percent were. Last month, he downgraded his rating on Affirm stock to a "hold."
B.N.P.L. is hardly a new financing option for the consumer. During the Great Depression, department stores began layaway programs, which allow customers to pay in installments. They were designed to keep people shopping rather than to generate profit directly. More than 80 years later, the fintech version may wind up with similar aims.
Goldman says it's committed to GreenSky, but, as it disclosed last week, the losses are piling up. It hopes B.N.P.L. will draw in new customers, but so far it's not driving profits that so many banks and tech firms are hunting these days.

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech's challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector -- employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts -- but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn -- mass layoffs, for example -- there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent -- many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $ 420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire's). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk's actions led to the wild swings in Tesla's stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was "deliberately reckless" -- investors' words -- when he posted the tweet.
What's Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. "There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase," Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials' intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.
Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 -- though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed's attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country's largest tech companies, this week's quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver ... more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth -- the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $ 10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift's lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump's Instagram and Facebook accounts "in the coming weeks."

Full text: Check out these shows whether you're looking to start a business, pivot to a new industry or just better handle office politics.
The last three years have fundamentally reshaped working life in ways that could very well be permanent. The pandemic ushered remote work into the mainstream (a new normal that has proved resilient despite some managers' best efforts), precipitated a surge in entrepreneurial activity and prompted a trend that's been called "The Great Resignation." Record numbers of Americans have quit their jobs altogether, while others are redressing their work-life balance by "quiet quitting." But now there are signs that the white-hot labor market is cooling, with layoffs increasingly widespread and many experts predicting a recession. Whether you're on the cusp of a career pivot, considering starting a business or just trying to navigate office politics at your current job, these six podcasts will help you figure out those next steps.
'ZigZag'
Podcast fans are likely familiar with the voice of Manoush Zomorodi, a longtime host of WNYC's "Note to Self," who originally started this show to chronicle a career pivot. In 2018, Zomorodi and Jen Poyant, then her co-host, both quit their public radio jobs to launch their own crypto-funded production company, with the goal of finding a kinder, more sustainable approach to entrepreneurship. The first three seasons of "ZigZag" charted the ups and downs of that experience in compelling and vulnerable fashion, and post-pandemic the show has shape-shifted to focus on interviews with "unusual dynamos" who defy business norms (like Ben Chestnut, a co-founder of MailChimp who has refused to take money from venture capitalists). More recently, the sixth season sees Zomorodi sharing a step-by-step road map for listeners seeking a career reset.

'The Art of Speaking Up'
A wealth of evidence has established that women face unique challenges in the workplace: They are less likely to speak up; more likely to underestimate their value; and face the so-called "double bind" dilemma of being perceived as either competent or likable in leadership roles, but not both. And while standard advice often focuses on telling women how to change their behavior without addressing the psychology and socialization that underpin it, "The Art of Speaking Up" tackles both. Inspired by her own experiences of intense impostor syndrome at her first corporate job, Jessica Guzik started this podcast five years ago, and has since released more than 200 episodes covering subjects including salary negotiation, working motherhood and the contentious (and gendered) role of the exclamation point in work emails.

'How's Work? With Esther Perel'
Esther Perel has made her name primarily as a couples counselor, sharing many of her insights on her hit podcast "Where Should We Begin?" But as Perel argues, the psychological patterns of our romantic relationships also show up in other contexts, including the workplace. Inspired by her own experience of working with a business partner for the first time, Perel created "How's Work?" in which she conducts sessions with co-workers, business partners and others whose relationships have been formed, upended or even destroyed by the places they work. The conversations are just as intimate and intense as any traditional couple's therapy session, demonstrating just how many ways there are for the lines between professional and personal to blur.
Starter episode: "My Promotion Ended Our Friendship"
'How I Built This'
This NPR series explores the origin stories of some of the most well-known brands in the world, through the eyes of their creators. You don't need to have any entrepreneurial spirit whatsoever to be engaged, especially because many of its episodes center on classic underdog stories. The show's very first interviewee, Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, who had twice failed the LSAT and was selling fax machines door to door when she came up with the idea for the shapewear company, or Beto Perez, who created Zumba on the spur of the moment after bringing the wrong music to a dance class he was teaching. Guy Raz, the host, consistently draws out humanizing details and specific memories from his guests, ensuring that "How I Built This" is more than a rote collection of success stories.

'Good Life Project'
There's now a plethora of self-help podcasts offering inspirational tips on how to live a more meaningful life, but back in 2012, when "Good Life Project" began releasing episodes, it was one of just a handful. The show is not specifically about work, so much as the broader question of finding purpose in one's life, and career choice inevitably plays a huge role in those conversations. Jonathan Fields, the host, interviews guests from all walks of life including authors, doctors and psychologists, many of whom share stories of the experiences that changed their outlook or offer novel ways to approach familiar problems. At a time when so many people are reconsidering their relationship with work, the show's holistic approach to fulfillment is bound to resonate.
Starter episode: "What Should I Do With My Life? First, Do This."
'StartUp'
One of the first podcasts produced by Gimlet Media was this enjoyably high-concept show about the process of launching the company itself. The first season of "StartUp" documented "what happens when someone who knows nothing about business starts one," as self-deprecatingly told by Alex Blumberg, a co-founder of Gimlet, and offered a candid and endearing glimpse into the uncertainty and terror of entrepreneurship. Subsequent seasons have delved into the rocky origin stories of other companies, including a matchmaking app called Dating Ring and the video streaming company Twitch (now owned by Amazon). But perhaps the most essential season of all is the most recent, which offered a welcome change from tech-focused startup stories in chronicling the founding of Success Academy, New York City's polarizing network of charter schools.

Gen Z's Distorted Sense of Selfie: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mercedes Jimenez-Cortes often takes pictures of herself in the domed mirrors that hang in parking garages. The mirrors turn an everyday scene surreal, bending concrete like it's jelly and exaggerating the size of Ms. Jimenez-Cortes's face, her iPhone or her extended middle finger.
Ms. Jimenez-Cortes, 24, who works for Instacart and lives in Atlanta, liked the look of the mirrors so much that she recently purchased one for her apartment. The stylishly named PLX18 Circular Acrylic Indoor Convex Security mirror cost $ 37 on Amazon and came equipped with a swivel mounting bracket to extend its range of visibility in loading docks and driveways. Ms. Jimenez-Cortes hung the mirror near a disco ball in her living room, where her cat, Pixie, uses it to gaze at his own contorted reflection.
"It looks funny," Ms. Jimenez-Cortes said. "But it looks funny on purpose."
So goes Gen Z's latest approach to the self-portrait. The #NoFilter selfie is out, and obvious, goofy distortion is in. There's the 0.5 ultra-wide-angle lens for extreme forced perspective, the A.I. portrait generator for rendering you like a painting, and the lo-fi digital camera for a grainy, nostalgic quality. Some young people in search of these effects are also turning to an item better known for capturing interstates than influencers: the traffic mirror.
You have seen these mirrors before. Sometimes called blind-spot mirrors, they wing out from school buses and eighteen-wheelers. They are also often used as safety or security mirrors, allowing attendants at grocery stores and subway stations to keep watch over a wide area. They are probably most accurately described as convex mirrors, but on TikTok, a platform adept at warping language, they have become known as traffic mirrors.
Ms. Jimenez-Cortes said she sees the mirrors all over the app, where they are being pitched as both a selfie tool and low-cost home décor hack. The hashtag #trafficmirror, which has more than 20 million views, appears alongside ones like #inspo, #roomdesign and #aesthetic. The mirrors are sometimes included in TikTok video roundups from street wear accounts and praised by commenters as "bus driver core."
"There has indeed been a slight upward trend in sales lately," Stylianos Peppas, the director of SNS Safety Ltd., a traffic and parking safety company in London that sells convex mirrors through Amazon, wrote in an email. He said he thought the mirrors had been selling well "because people are increasingly concerned about the safety of themselves and their families."
But social media suggests a less practical motivation. On Pinterest, searches for "convex mirror" were four times higher in December than they had been a year earlier, according to Swasti Sarna, the company's global director of data insights.
That traffic mirrors have not historically been fashionable is part of their appeal. Cheap, ordinary and conspicuously out of place in a bedroom or Instagram feed, the mirrors add a layer of irreverence to photos.
In November, Elijah Ray, 25, who works at a wood mill and lives in Portland, Ore., ordered a set of two traffic mirrors on Amazon for $ 15. Before he bought them, he said he would stop to take a selfie when he saw the mirrors at a bus stop or a CVS; now he takes them at home, capturing his outfits and much of his décor, like his red LED light strips and the handmade yin and yang rug where his bearded dragon chilled in the background during a Zoom interview.
"I kind of like the vibe of, I have one giant eye and one little eye," he said.
The way the mirrors distort the face and body can take some of the pressure off looking perfect, said Allie Rowbottom, the author of "Aesthetica," a 2022 novel about an influencer who tries to undo years of cosmetic surgery.
The proliferation of apps like Facetune to smooth pores and cinch waists beyond the point of possibility brought about a #NoFilter backlash that seemed to emphasize authenticity. But even some of that so-called realness still required self-manipulation. Looking "absolutely bizarro" online is Gen Z's rejection of both approaches, Ms. Rowbottom said.
"We've exited the conventional era of the selfie that began in 2012, 2013 with the advent of Instagram," she said.
The history of distorted portraiture, however, predates social media. The Italian painter Parmigianino was about 21 when he painted his "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" in 1524. Parmigianino used two barbers' mirrors that exaggerated the size of his hand and made the horizon behind him appear curved and off-kilter.
Whereas earlier portraits by Albrecht Dürer, for example, appeared meticulously posed, Parmigianino's was playful and fluid while still demonstrating virtuosic painting skill, said Sabine Haag, the director general of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where the portrait is displayed.
Like today's selfie takers, the painter was looking to capture something specific. "It really should give you the idea it's not constructed," Dr. Haag continued. "It's a very spontaneous kind of thing."
Much later, when Nikon's first fish-eye camera lens became broadly available to consumers in 1962, similar images became a fixture of pop culture. In the 1960s, fish-eye lenses were used to photograph album covers for Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones, and to document the trippiness of Woodstock.
But the fish-eye look is perhaps best associated with the 1990s -- the decade that is at turns lovingly and ironically emulated by Gen Z. The lens became a defining look of the decade through its prevalence in both skateboarding and hip-hop videography, said Jeremy Elkin, the director of the documentary "All the Streets Are Silent."
The director Hype Williams used fish-eye lenses to heighten Missy Elliott's futuristic outfits in the music video for "The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)" and Busta Rhymes's many characters in "Gimme Some More." The ultrawide angle of the lens could contain a fast-moving skateboarder, Missy Elliott's entire Hummer or a rooftop full of Beastie Boys.
The fish-eye look is back on recent album covers for Lorde and Harry Styles, Mr. Elkin noted. By creating a dramatic look with one relatively inexpensive piece of equipment, the convex lens reflects a D.I.Y. ethos that is timeless among the young, edgy and broke.
"With skateboarding, music videos and kids taking selfies in mirrors in a parking garage, the thing they all have in common is that you don't need high production value or some crazy scene or some insane location," Mr. Elkin said. "A fish-eye lens can take something as basic as a studio, it can turn it into something exciting."
The same logic applies to TikTok, where Harry White posted a video of his traffic mirror in July that has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
Mr. White, 26, a home décor content creator in Cardiff, Wales, peels strips of protective film off the mirror and prods its squishy surface in the video, which verges on A.S.M.R. He said he had gotten messages from viewers asking where they could get the mirrors for themselves.
"The thing with TikTok is, it's so competitive," he said. "When one creator's video does really good, like mine did, other content creators will try and replicate the video, even if their home décor pieces are so different and it's not going to match their vibe," he said.
The experience deepened Mr. White's reservations about the quick trend cycles in décor and fashion that spring up on the app. The mirrors are inexpensive enough that people might buy them, film a video or two, and then throw them away, following a fast fashion playbook.
Past buzzy iPhone photography accessories have not necessarily stood the test of time: Who is still reaching for a flattering angle using a selfie stick?
Whether or not the traffic mirror sticks around, Ms. Rowbottom believes the sentiment behind it is an enduring one.
"Leaning into a distorted image of the self through a mirror or through your iPhone screen is an act of reclamation and rebellion," Ms. Rowbottom said. "That vibe is so essential to youth culture in any era."
Justyna Gwozdz, 26, an accountant in Katowice, Poland, bought a traffic mirror in June from a home improvement store and hung it up in her bathroom, above the toilet. She takes almost daily pictures in it that document her best party looks and her worst bed head.
No matter how put-together she looks that day, she looks weird and funny in her traffic mirror -- and that's a relief. "You don't need to look good to look good in it," she said.

Stripe Enlists Top Banks
To Advise on Going Public
Stripe, the San Francisco payments provider and one of the world's most valuable private start-ups, hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase this week to advise it on a potential public listing in the next year, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
If a listing advances, Stripe's public debut would be among the largest and most anticipated in its class of start-ups, potentially reopening the moribund public markets to new offerings.
Investors valued Stripe, which was founded in 2010 by the brothers John and Patrick Collison, at $ 95 billion in 2021. Last year, amid market tumult for tech start-ups, the company lowered its internal valuation by 28 percent to $ 74 billion and cut 14 percent of its staff.
The company, which sells payment processing software to companies including Peloton, Wayfair and Amazon, has put off tapping the public markets, but early investors are eager to cash in. ERIN GRIFFITH

MEDIA
Major Magazine Publisher
Lays Off 7% of Its Staff
Dotdash Meredith, the publishing giant that owns publications including People, InStyle and Better Homes & Gardens, said on Thursday that it would cut 7 percent of its staff, the latest media and tech company to do layoffs.
The cuts will affect 274 people, Neil Vogel, the company's chief executive, said in a companywide email.
The layoffs were first reported by Axios.
Dotdash, a subsidiary of Barry Diller's IAC that specialized in digital outlets like Serious Eats and Investopedia, acquired the magazine publisher Meredith in 2021 for about $ 2.7 billion. The combined company, one of the largest digital publishers, includes a range of lifestyle and entertainment brands like Entertainment Weekly, Martha Stewart and Food & Wine.
Since combining, Dotdash Meredith ended the print editions of several of its magazines, including InStyle and Entertainment Weekly, focusing instead on their digital versions. KATIE ROBERTSON
RETAIL
Bath & Beyond Reports
It Defaulted on Payments
Bed Bath & Beyond disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it had defaulted on certain debt payments. It is the most salient sign of strain yet for the retailer, which said earlier this month that it was exploring a possible bankruptcy filing after a disappointing holiday season.
The company has been looking for cash to help it avoid filing for bankruptcy, but warned in the filing that it did "not have sufficient resources" to pay its debt.
A bankruptcy filing could come within weeks, two people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.
The retailer had about 32,000 employees as of February 2022 and has roughly 900 U.S. stores.
In January, it reported a $ 393 million loss for the third quarter, 42 percent than a year earlier. Its net sales dropped to about $ 1.3 billion, 33 percent less than the year before. LAUREN HIRSCH

University of Texas Plans Online A.I. Degree: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Amid a boom in new tools like ChatGPT, the Austin campus plans to train thousands of students in sought-after skills in artificial intelligence.
The University of Texas at Austin, one of the nation's leading computer science schools, said on Thursday that it was starting a large-scale, low-cost online Master of Science degree program in artificial intelligence.
The first of its kind among elite computing schools, the new program could help swiftly expand the A.I. work force in the United States as tech giants like Microsoft rush to invest billions in the field.
The university announced the initiative amid a clamor over new technology powered by artificial intelligence that can generate humanlike art and texts. And while some of the technology industry's biggest companies are laying off workers after years of rapid growth, hiring in A.I. is expected to stay strong.
University officials said they planned to train thousands of graduate students in sought-after skills like machine learning, for a tuition of about $ 10,000, starting in the spring of 2024. School officials said the cost was intended to make A.I. education more affordable. By contrast, Johns Hopkins University offers an online M.S. degree in artificial intelligence for more than $ 45,000.
"A.I. is now becoming an essential tool in fields way outside the scope of a handful of tech companies," said Adam Klivans, a computer science professor at Texas who is the director of the online A.I. master's program. Noting that A.I. experts are in high demand in industries like biotechnology and finance, Professor Klivans said the new online degree was "something working professionals can participate in to learn the expertise their companies need without leaving their jobs."
The funding to develop the new master's program came in part from the National Science Foundation. In 2020, the foundation awarded the University of Texas a five-year, $ 20 million grant to establish an A.I. institute in machine learning. That is a field in which computer algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing large data sets -- such as predicting which drug formulations could be best used to treat new viruses.
University officials said tenure-track faculty in computer science and related fields, like computer engineering, would teach the online master's courses via recorded video lectures, along with some interactive sessions. Faculty members involved in an interdisciplinary research program at the university called Good Systems, which is aimed at developing A.I. tools whose potential societal benefits outweigh their harms, will also participate.
The online master's program will include advanced courses in fields like machine learning; A.I. applications in health; and natural language processing, which helps voice assistants like Siri and Alexa understand human speech. Each course will also include formal ethics training to give students a framework for understanding the societal implications of A.I. systems.
"In each of the classes, the instructor will ask students to reflect on the possible benefits and possible harms of the technologies they are learning about," said Peter Stone, a computer science professor at Texas who teaches a course in ethical robotics. "People developing the next generation of technologies, as well as users, need to have a realistic view of what are the strengths and limitations of A.I."
Those creative and critical skills could be in increasingly high demand. Tech companies are scrambling to develop advanced chatbots and other A.I. tools that can generate images and texts in response to short prompts -- even as some researchers warn that the rush to deploy these novel systems could pose risks, such as political manipulation.
The Texas program was inspired in part by the Georgia Institute of Technology, which in 2014 became the first leading computer science school to start a large-scale, low-cost online master's degree in that field. Thousands of students have graduated from the program.
In 2019, the University of Texas at Austin started its own large-scale online master's degree program in computer science, followed by a similar online master's in data science in 2021. Together, the programs have an enrollment of about 2,800 students.
The university plans to open applications for the new A.I. master's program this June with the aim of enrolling more than 2,000 students per year, said Don Fussell, the chair of the computer science department. To be accepted into the online program, he said, students will not be required to have a bachelor's degree in computer science, but they will need to have expertise in a technical field like engineering or computing. The A.I. courses will be offered through edX, a popular learning platform that also hosts the university's online master's courses in computer and data science.
With widespread layoffs at Amazon, Google and other tech firms, the online program may already have a ready-made audience: tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers looking to specialize in artificial intelligence.
"If these layoffs continue, I think we are going to see a shift among a lot of people from general computer science and tech backgrounds to A.I.," Professor Fussell said. "That's the way the field is moving."

Hiring Spree By Chipotle As Busy Time Approaches: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The restaurant chain is pitching for more workers as it aims to double the number of outlets in North America.
Chipotle Mexican Grill, the fast-casual food chain, said on Thursday that it planned to hire 15,000 workers ahead of its busiest time of year, a sharp contrast to the other large companies that are laying off employees because of pandemic overexpansion and worries about the economy.
The company said in a statement that it was preparing for what it described as "burrito season," from March to May, when it typically has most of its business.
"We will continue bringing in new crew to support Chipotle's aggressive growth plans," Scott Boatwright, Chipotle's chief restaurant officer, said in a statement. The company employs more than 100,000 people at more than 3,000 restaurants across North America. Its long-term plan calls for eventually running 7,000 outlets.
Unlike Chipotle, many companies are shedding staff and cutting costs. Tech companies in particular have recently announced layoffs, with tens of thousands of job cuts at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and others. Industrial firms like Dow, banks like Goldman Sachs and media companies like The Washington Post have also recently laid off employees.
The Federal Reserve has been paying close attention to the labor market as it raises interest rates to bring inflation under control by slowing the economy. The most recent data showed that U.S. employers added fewer jobs in December than in earlier months, but the pace of hiring remained solid.
A spokeswoman for Chipotle said in an email that the company frequently had the most sales in the spring because of "weather and daylight." She added that restaurants in college areas did well when school was in session. The company opened more than 200 restaurants last year and plans to open up to 285 this year, the spokeswoman said, and it anticipates it will need to recruit more workers.
Wells Fargo analysts expressed doubt about Chipotle's ability to hire, given "pockets of wage pressure," they wrote in a report. The company has so far been able to offset higher pay and recruiting costs by raising menu prices, but signs of slower sales late last year suggest that may not last.
In its latest earnings report, for the third quarter of 2022, Chipotle recorded a profit of nearly $ 260 million, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier. In October, the company said its prices were on track to rise by nearly 15 percent in 2022 as it, like many consumer-facing companies, passed on higher costs to consumers.

Full text: Teenagers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints travel to Finland for missionary service in this documentary that offers limited insight.
American adolescents from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints trek to Finland for missionary service in the pallid documentary "The Mission." Directed by Tania Anderson, the film opens with its young subjects preparing for their travels, and then tracks their two-year journeys and the challenges that attend the substantial undertaking.
One hopes that such access would yield new insights into the church. But as the events unspool, the film struggles to crystallize more than a handful of compelling points.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The documentary spends time with four missionaries in particular: Sister Bills, Sister Field, Elder Davis and Elder Pauole. (The church frowns upon the use of first names.) The young women are sunny. The young men are stolid. Beyond their general dispositions and their aptitude for Finnish, which each of them are asked to study, the film fails to bring them to life as individuals.
Upon arrival in Finland, the missionaries receive companions who serve as their roommates and proselytizing partners. The kids are instructed not to leave one another's sight, a rule that we later learn is meant to prime the adolescents for marriage, which awaits them at home. This vital detail is obscured, however, by our surface-level time with the pairs. We see them pray side by side and knock on Finns' doors, but before the camera, the companions default to reticence.
Being a teenager is tough enough, and living for years in a foreign city must add stress to the usual malaise. Unfortunately, Anderson's camera feels like an outsider to this unease, less a window into a demanding time than an obstacle to our understanding.

University of Texas Will Offer Large-Scale Online Master’s Degree in AI

The University of Texas at Austin, one of the nation’s leading computer science schools, said Thursday that it was starting a large-scale, low-cost online master’s of science degree program in artificial intelligence.
The first of its kind among elite computing schools, the new program could help swiftly expand the AI workforce in the United States as tech giants such as Microsoft rush to invest billions in the field.
The university announced the initiative amid a clamor over new technology powered by AI that can generate humanlike art and texts. And although some of the technology industry’s biggest companies are laying off workers after years of rapid growth, hiring in AI is expected to stay strong.
University officials said they planned to train thousands of graduate students in sought-after skills such as machine learning, for a tuition of about $10,000, starting in spring 2024. School officials said the cost was intended to make AI education more affordable. By contrast, Johns Hopkins University offers an online MS degree in artificial intelligence for more than $45,000.
“AI is now becoming an essential tool in fields way outside the scope of a handful of tech companies,” said Adam Klivans, a computer science professor at Texas and the director of the online AI master’s program. Noting that AI experts are in high demand in industries such as biotechnology and finance, Klivans said the new online degree was “something working professionals can participate in to learn the expertise their companies need without leaving their jobs.”
The funding to develop the master’s program came in part from the National Science Foundation. In 2020, the foundation awarded the University of Texas a five-year, $20 million grant to establish an AI institute in machine learning. That is a field in which computer algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing large data sets — such as predicting which drug formulations could be best used to treat new viruses.
University officials said tenure-track faculty in computer science and related fields, such as computer engineering, would teach the online master’s courses via recorded video lectures, along with some interactive sessions. Faculty members involved in an interdisciplinary research program at the university called Good Systems, which is aimed at developing AI tools whose potential societal benefits outweigh their harms, will also participate.
The online master’s program will include advanced courses in fields such as machine learning; AI applications in health; and natural language processing, which helps voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa understand human speech. Each course will also include formal ethics training to give students a framework for understanding the societal implications of AI systems.
“In each of the classes, the instructor will ask students to reflect on the possible benefits and possible harms of the technologies they are learning about,” said Peter Stone, a computer science professor at Texas who teaches a course in ethical robotics. “People developing the next generation of technologies, as well as users, need to have a realistic view of what are the strengths and limitations of AI.”
Those creative and critical skills could be in increasingly high demand. Tech companies are scrambling to develop advanced chatbots and other AI tools that can generate images and texts in response to short prompts — even as some researchers warn that the rush to deploy these novel systems could pose risks, such as political manipulation.
The Texas program was inspired in part by the Georgia Institute of Technology, which in 2014 became the first leading computer science school to start a large-scale, low-cost online master’s degree in that field. Thousands of students have graduated from the program.
In 2019, the University of Texas at Austin started its own large-scale online master’s degree program in computer science, followed by a similar online master’s in data science in 2021. Together, the programs have an enrollment of about 2,800 students.
The university plans to open applications for the new AI master’s program this June with the aim of enrolling more than 2,000 students per year, said Don Fussell, chair of the computer science department. To be accepted into the online program, he said, students will not be required to have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, but they will need to have expertise in a technical field such as engineering or computing. The AI courses will be offered through edX, a popular learning platform that also hosts the university’s online master’s courses in computer and data science.
With widespread layoffs at Amazon, Google and other tech firms, the online program may already have a ready-made audience: tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers looking to specialize in AI.
“If these layoffs continue, I think we are going to see a shift among a lot of people from general computer science and tech backgrounds to AI,” Fussell said. “That’s the way the field is moving.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The last three years have fundamentally reshaped working life in ways that could very well be permanent. The pandemic ushered remote work into the mainstream (a new normal that has proved resilient despite some managers’ best efforts), precipitated a surge in entrepreneurial activity and prompted a trend that’s been called “The Great Resignation.” Record numbers of Americans have quit their jobs altogether, while others are redressing their work-life balance by “quiet quitting.” But now there are signs that the white-hot labor market is cooling, with layoffs increasingly widespread and many experts predicting a recession. Whether you’re on the cusp of a career pivot, considering starting a business or just trying to navigate office politics at your current job, these six podcasts will help you figure out those next steps.
‘ZigZag’
Podcast fans are likely familiar with the voice of Manoush Zomorodi, a longtime host of WNYC’s “Note to Self,” who originally started this show to chronicle a career pivot. In 2018, Zomorodi and Jen Poyant, then her co-host, both quit their public radio jobs to launch their own crypto-funded production company, with the goal of finding a kinder, more sustainable approach to entrepreneurship. The first three seasons of “ZigZag” charted the ups and downs of that experience in compelling and vulnerable fashion, and post-pandemic the show has shape-shifted to focus on interviews with “unusual dynamos” who defy business norms (like Ben Chestnut, a co-founder of MailChimp who has refused to take money from venture capitalists). More recently, the sixth season sees Zomorodi sharing a step-by-step road map for listeners seeking a career reset.
Starter episode: “Step 1: The Pulse”

‘The Art of Speaking Up’
A wealth of evidence has established that women face unique challenges in the workplace: They are less likely to speak up; more likely to underestimate their value; and face the so-called “double bind” dilemma of being perceived as either competent or likable in leadership roles, but not both. And while standard advice often focuses on telling women how to change their behavior without addressing the psychology and socialization that underpin it, “The Art of Speaking Up” tackles both. Inspired by her own experiences of intense impostor syndrome at her first corporate job, Jessica Guzik started this podcast five years ago, and has since released more than 200 episodes covering subjects including salary negotiation, working motherhood and the contentious (and gendered) role of the exclamation point in work emails.
Starter episode: “Why Assertiveness Can Feel So Hard, Icky, and Uncomfortable (Assertiveness, Part 1)”
—
‘How’s Work? With Esther Perel’
Esther Perel has made her name primarily as a couples counselor, sharing many of her insights on her hit podcast “Where Should We Begin?” But as Perel argues, the psychological patterns of our romantic relationships also show up in other contexts, including the workplace. Inspired by her own experience of working with a business partner for the first time, Perel created “How’s Work?” in which she conducts sessions with co-workers, business partners and others whose relationships have been formed, upended or even destroyed by the places they work. The conversations are just as intimate and intense as any traditional couple’s therapy session, demonstrating just how many ways there are for the lines between professional and personal to blur.
Starter episode: “My Promotion Ended Our Friendship”
—
‘How I Built This’
This NPR series explores the origin stories of some of the most well-known brands in the world, through the eyes of their creators. You don’t need to have any entrepreneurial spirit whatsoever to be engaged, especially because many of its episodes center on classic underdog stories. The show’s first interviewee, Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, had twice failed the LSAT and was selling fax machines door to door when she came up with the idea for the shapewear company. Beto Perez, another interviewee, created Zumba on the spur of the moment after bringing the wrong music to a dance class he was teaching. Guy Raz, the host, consistently draws out humanizing details and specific memories from his guests, ensuring that “How I Built This” is more than a rote collection of success stories.
Starter episode: “Spanx: Sara Blakely”
—
‘Good Life Project’
There’s now a plethora of self-help podcasts offering inspirational tips on how to live a more meaningful life, but back in 2012, when “Good Life Project” began releasing episodes, it was one of just a handful. The show is not specifically about work, so much as the broader question of finding purpose in one’s life, and career choice inevitably plays a huge role in those conversations. Jonathan Fields, the host, interviews guests from all walks of life including authors, doctors and psychologists, many of whom share stories of the experiences that changed their outlook or offer novel ways to approach familiar problems. At a time when so many people are reconsidering their relationship with work, the show’s holistic approach to fulfillment is bound to resonate.
Starter episode: “What Should I Do With My Life? First, Do This.”
—
‘StartUp’
One of the first podcasts produced by Gimlet Media was this enjoyably high-concept show about the process of launching the company itself. The first season of “StartUp” documented “what happens when someone who knows nothing about business starts one,” as self-deprecatingly told by Alex Blumberg, a co-founder of Gimlet, and offered a candid and endearing glimpse into the uncertainty and terror of entrepreneurship. Subsequent seasons have delved into the rocky origin stories of other companies, including a matchmaking app called Dating Ring and the video streaming company Twitch (now owned by Amazon). But perhaps the most essential season of all is the most recent, which offered a welcome change from tech-focused startup stories in chronicling the founding of Success Academy, New York City’s polarizing network of charter schools.

Unlocking the Power of Visual Thinking: [Letter]

Full text: Readers agree with Ms. Grandin that it is often undervalued.
To the Editor:
Re "Society Is Failing Visual Thinkers, and That Hurts Us All," by Temple Grandin (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 12):
As a retired associate professor of the visual arts, I applaud this essay. Because the visual arts are generally considered as lesser than courses in math, science and writing, visual literacy is overlooked by society and in education curriculums nationwide.
A sighted person obtains and processes visual information more directly and immediately than any other form of sensory input. Babies' first thoughts come from learning to make sense of the visual world as their brains begin to organize and make sense of what they see. Drawing comes before words. Words then serve as abstract symbols and generalizations. As our vocabulary grows, verbal thinking begins to dominate.
Visual thinking is a language. Most of our education leaders do not understand visual thinking because they're verbal thinkers. This is why visual literacy is undervalued.
Every great building in the world began as a sketch.
Ken Conley
Alexandria, Va.
To the Editor:
Bravo, Temple Grandin, for explaining why visual thinkers are needed to solve some of society's most pressing problems!
When my language-delayed son was 6 years old, he wanted to walk across the Manhattan Bridge. The route from the subway exit to the bridge was not obvious. I had to consult a map several times.
My son told me to put the map away as he walked the exact route without error. How did he know it? "The subway map," he said. "But that map doesn't show streets," I said. "Yeah, but I see the way," he responded.
My son has always been fascinated by maps and routes. He quickly encodes them entirely. I no longer need Waze to go anywhere he has been. His school recognized him as the student "Most Likely to Get You Home From Anywhere."
He is fortunate to attend a school that addresses his language delays. But there is no curriculum to develop his visual gift. If schools were half as devoted to developing the right side of the brain as the left, the visual genius of children like my son would be fully realized. Perhaps they would map supercomplex spaces like the ocean bed, the Amazon rainforest or the brain's intricate circuitries.
Paul Siegel
New York
To the Editor:
I am a retired art teacher who has taught all grades, and I strongly agree with Temple Grandin's comments on the lack of visual education in our schools.
In New York City art was always the first subject to be eliminated when there was a financial crunch. I don't think the powers that be realize how important art education is.
First of all, it is a universal language that everyone can understand, whether literate or not. Second, it provides a means for creative thinking and problem solving, which translates to other disciplines.
People think and learn differently, and we need to reduce our dependence on academic testing alone. We need more creative thinkers and problem solvers in this world!
I have seen tremendous transformations in students who when successful in art class gain confidence in themselves and then succeed in school and in life.

Gen Z’s Distorted Sense of Selfie

Mercedes Jimenez-Cortes often takes pictures of herself in the domed mirrors that hang in parking garages. The mirrors turn an everyday scene surreal, bending concrete like it’s jelly and exaggerating the size of Jimenez-Cortes’ face, her iPhone or her extended middle finger.
Jimenez-Cortes, 24, who works for Instacart and lives in Atlanta, liked the look of the mirrors so much that she recently purchased one for her apartment. The stylishly named PLX18 Circular Acrylic Indoor Convex Security mirror cost $37 on Amazon and came equipped with a swivel mounting bracket to extend its range of visibility in loading docks and driveways. Jimenez-Cortes hung the mirror near a disco ball in her living room, where her cat, Pixie, uses it to gaze at his own contorted reflection.
“It looks funny,” Jimenez-Cortes said. “But it looks funny on purpose.”
So goes Gen Z’s latest approach to the self-portrait. The #NoFilter selfie is out, and obvious, goofy distortion is in. There’s the 0.5 ultra-wide-angle lens for extreme forced perspective; the AI portrait generator for rendering you like a painting; and the lo-fi digital camera for a grainy, nostalgic quality. Some young people in search of these effects are also turning to an item better known for capturing interstates than influencers: the traffic mirror.
You have seen these mirrors before. Sometimes called blind-spot mirrors, they wing out from school buses and eighteen-wheelers. They are also often used as safety or security mirrors, allowing attendants at grocery stores and subway stations to keep watch over a wide area. They are probably most accurately described as convex mirrors, but on TikTok, a platform adept at warping language, they have become known as traffic mirrors.
Jimenez-Cortes said she sees the mirrors all over the app, where they are being pitched as both a selfie tool and low-cost home décor hack. The hashtag #trafficmirror, which has more than 20 million views, appears alongside ones like #inspo, #roomdesign and #aesthetic. The mirrors are sometimes included in TikTok video roundups from streetwear accounts and praised by commenters as “bus driver core.”
“There has indeed been a slight upward trend in sales lately,” Stylianos Peppas, the director of SNS Safety Ltd., a traffic and parking safety company in London that sells convex mirrors through Amazon, wrote in an email. He said he thought the mirrors had been selling well “because people are increasingly concerned about the safety of themselves and their families.”
But social media suggests a less practical motivation. On Pinterest, searches for “convex mirror” were four times higher in December than they had been a year earlier, according to Swasti Sarna, the company’s global director of data insights.
That traffic mirrors have not historically been fashionable is part of their appeal. Cheap, ordinary and conspicuously out of place in a bedroom or Instagram feed, the mirrors add a layer of irreverence to photos.
In November, Elijah Ray, 25, who works at a wood mill and lives in Portland, Oregon, ordered a set of two traffic mirrors on Amazon for $15. Before he bought them, he said he would stop to take a selfie when he saw the mirrors at a bus stop or a CVS; now he takes them at home, capturing his outfits and much of his décor, like his red LED light strips and the handmade yin and yang rug where his bearded dragon chilled in the background during a Zoom interview.
“I kind of like the vibe of, I have one giant eye and one little eye,” he said.
The way the mirrors distort the face and body can take some of the pressure off looking perfect, said Allie Rowbottom, the author of “Aesthetica,” a 2022 novel about an influencer who tries to undo years of cosmetic surgery.
The proliferation of apps like Facetune to smooth pores and cinch waists beyond the point of possibility brought about a #NoFilter backlash that seemed to emphasize authenticity. But even some of that so-called realness still required self-manipulation. Looking “absolutely bizarro” online is Gen Z’s rejection of both approaches, Rowbottom said.
“We’ve exited the conventional era of the selfie that began in 2012, 2013 with the advent of Instagram,” she said.
The history of distorted portraiture, however, predates social media. Italian painter Parmigianino was about 21 when he painted his “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror” in 1524. Parmigianino used two barbers’ mirrors that exaggerated the size of his hand and made the horizon behind him appear curved and off-kilter.
Whereas earlier portraits by Albrecht Dürer, for example, appeared meticulously posed, Parmigianino’s was playful and fluid while still demonstrating virtuosic painting skill, said Sabine Haag, the director-general of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where the portrait is displayed.
Like today’s selfie takers, the painter was looking to capture something specific. “It really should give you the idea it’s not constructed,” Haag continued. “It’s a very spontaneous kind of thing.”
Much later, when Nikon’s first fish-eye camera lens became broadly available to consumers in 1962, similar images became a fixture of pop culture. In the 1960s, fish-eye lenses were used to photograph album covers for Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones, and to document the trippiness of Woodstock.
But the fish-eye look is perhaps best associated with the 1990s — the decade that is at turns lovingly and ironically emulated by Gen Z. The lens became a defining look of the decade through its prevalence in both skateboarding and hip-hop videography, said Jeremy Elkin, the director of the documentary “All the Streets Are Silent.”
Director Hype Williams used fish-eye lenses to heighten Missy Elliott’s futuristic outfits in the music video for “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” and Busta Rhymes’ many characters in “Gimme Some More.” The ultrawide angle of the lens could contain a fast-moving skateboarder, Missy Elliott’s entire Hummer or a rooftop full of Beastie Boys.
The fish-eye look is back on recent album covers for Lorde and Harry Styles, Elkin noted. By creating a dramatic look with one relatively inexpensive piece of equipment, the convex lens reflects a DIY ethos that is timeless among the young, edgy and broke.
“With skateboarding, music videos and kids taking selfies in mirrors in a parking garage, the thing they all have in common is that you don’t need high production value or some crazy scene or some insane location,” Elkin said. “A fish-eye lens can take something as basic as a studio, it can turn it into something exciting.”
The same logic applies to TikTok, where Harry White posted a video of his traffic mirror in July that has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
White, 26, a home décor content creator in Cardiff, Wales, peels strips of protective film off the mirror and prods its squishy surface in the video, which verges on ASMR. He said he had gotten messages from viewers asking where they could get the mirrors for themselves.
“The thing with TikTok is, it’s so competitive,” he said. “When one creator’s video does really good, like mine did, other content creators will try and replicate the video, even if their home décor pieces are so different and it’s not going to match their vibe,” he said.
The experience deepened White’s reservations about the quick trend cycles in décor and fashion that spring up on the app. The mirrors are inexpensive enough that people might buy them, film a video or two, and then throw them away, following a fast fashion playbook.
Past buzzy iPhone photography accessories have not necessarily stood the test of time: Who is still reaching for a flattering angle using a selfie stick?
Whether or not the traffic mirror sticks around, Rowbottom believes the sentiment behind it is an enduring one.
“Leaning into a distorted image of the self through a mirror or through your iPhone screen is an act of reclamation and rebellion,” Rowbottom said. “That vibe is so essential to youth culture in any era.”
Justyna Gwozdz, 26, an accountant in Katowice, Poland, bought a traffic mirror in June from a home improvement store and hung it up in her bathroom, above the toilet. She takes almost daily pictures in it that document her best party looks and her worst bed head.
No matter how put-together she looks that day, she looks weird and funny in her traffic mirror — and that’s a relief. “You don’t need to look good to look good in it,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Washington Post Lays Off 20 Journalists

The Washington Post laid off 20 people from its newsroom Tuesday, according to a note sent to its staff.
In the note, Sally Buzbee, the executive editor, said the company had also identified 30 open positions that would not be filled.
“Newsroom leaders made these decisions after a thoughtful and deliberate review of our current roles and vacant positions,” Buzbee wrote.
She said people who were laid off were eligible to apply for open positions.
“While such changes are not easy, evolution is necessary for us to stay competitive, and the economic climate has guided our decision to act now,” Buzbee said. “We believe these steps will ultimately help us to fulfill our mission to scrutinize power and empower readers. We are not planning further job eliminations at this time.”
The layoffs affected several departments, including the Post’s metro staff, according to three people with knowledge of the decision. The online gaming vertical Launcher was shut down, as well as KidsPost, a section of the newspaper for children, according to another person with knowledge of the changes. The newsroom has more than 1,000 employees.
On Tuesday, while in the process of notifying those who had lost their jobs, the Post sent an email to staff members about the hiring of three new journalists.
The layoffs culminate weeks of uncertainty for the Post’s newsroom, which had been bracing for the cuts since Fred Ryan, the paper’s publisher, announced he was enacting a “single-digit” percentage reorganization of the company’s staff during a contentious all-hands meeting in December.
Ryan has told editors that he wants to focus the Post’s resources on positions that drive online readership and engagement and away from some traditional print beats, the people said.
The Post’s union said in a statement Tuesday that it had not received a “clear explanation for why the layoffs are happening despite numerous attempts to get answers.”
“We are still learning how many people will be impacted and whether there will be any effort to help them find new positions internally — which is the least the company could do at a time of continued growth and expansion,” the union said.
Roughly 60 staff members have joined the union since Ryan announced last month that layoffs were coming.
In recent months, the Post has grappled with stalled subscriber growth and falling ad revenue, as well as tensions between its newsroom and leadership. The company lost money last year, and it now has fewer than the 3 million subscribers it had at the end of 2020.
The layoffs followed a rare visit to the Post’s newsroom by its owner, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder. Last week, Bezos met with senior leaders and sat in on a news meeting. One member of the staff approached Bezos as he left the meeting and asked why the Post wasn’t offering employees buyouts before resorting to layoffs.

Tech Giants Roll Back a Pandemic Spree: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of the biggest tech companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts. But even after the layoffs, their work forces are still behemoths.
For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn't hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has -- and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies -- Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft -- have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. The executives pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.
1.54 million employees -- 18,000 layoffs = 1.2% of work force*
*Since the end of 2019, the company has grown by 728,000 people.
"As part of our annual planning process for 2023, leaders across the company have been working with their teams and looking at their work force levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year's review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we've hired rapidly over the last several years."
-- Andy Jassy, chief executive, Jan. 4
186,779 employees -- 12,000 layoffs = 6.4% of work force
"I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here. Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today."
-- Sundar Pichai, chief executive, Jan. 20
87,314 employees -- 11,000 layoffs = 12.6% of work force
"At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected."
-- Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive, Nov. 9
221,000 employees -- 10,000 layoffs = 4.5% of work force
"We're living through times of significant change, and as I meet with customers and partners, a few things are clear. First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we're now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more with less."
-- Satya Nadella, chief executive, Jan. 18

Full text: The intelligence may be artificial, but the thrills are real in this month's collection of sci-fi picks.
'Jung_E'
Stream it on Netflix.
If ethical and emotional issues pertaining to artificial intelligence are your jam, this Netflix original is a must-see. And if you just want badass action with robots, brawls, devious scientists and grand futuristic landscapes, it'll do the job, too. The South Korean director Yeon Sang-ho burst on the international scene in 2016 with the insta-classic zombie actioner "Train to Busan," then he delivered more undead with the sprawling "Peninsula" (2020). Now Yeon is back with "Jung_E," which considers A.I. with a degree of emotional sensitivity rare in a film that also deploys virtuosic whiz-bang fights.
The starting point is a post-climate apocalypse Earth in which millions of people have relocated to orbiting shelters. Three of those stations have attacked the others, leading to a decades-long war, and Earth is now dominated by the military-industrial complex. The goal of one such company is to transfer the brain of the comatose war hero Captain Yun Jung-yi (Kim Hyun-joo) into an exact replica to create a mighty combat android. In a key wrinkle, the project is led by Yun's own daughter, Seo-hyun (Kang Soo-youn). While "Jung_E" starts off like a riff on "Edge of Tomorrow," it quickly becomes obvious that Yeon is interested in more complicated matters, including the moral standards of cybernetics and the perils of the grieving process. This beautiful movie rewards patience -- and heck, that final battle on a monorail is awesome, too.
'Kids vs. Aliens'
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Some movies proudly claim their B heritage, and so does this goofball tribute to the heady days of 1980s exploitation, which nails that period's style. Were it not for a drone steered by young Gary (Dominic Mariche), you might find yourself wondering what year Jason Eisener made his film. Much to Gary's chagrin, his older sister, Sam (Phoebe Rex), falls in with a group of bad kids led by the handsome-but-psycho Billy (Calem MacDonald, giving off strong Christian Slater in "Heathers" vibes).
Just as the teens host a bacchanalian Halloween party at Gary and Sam's house, while their parents are away, aliens decide this is a perfect time to attack. Looking like actors in rubber suits, they have an underwater lair, vomit acid-like green goo and kill everybody in sight -- in other words, they are perfect. Add wrestling references and a vintage-sounding score, by Andrew Gordon Macpherson, awash in synthesizers, and you have a near-perfect study in retro silliness. The ending suggests there might be more to come.
'Incredible But True'
Stream it on Arrow.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Trust the prolific absurdist auteur Quentin Dupieux ("Deerskin," "Mandibles") to come up with a comically metaphysical take on time travel. Over the past decade, Dupieux has emerged as France's king of high-concept, low-budget comedy, and this is among his finest efforts. Alain and Marie (Alain Chabat and Léa Drucker) buy a house whose amenities include a time portal in the basement: If you climb down a manhole, you emerge, in an Escher-like feat, on the top floor -- but also 12 hours later and 3 days younger.
Marie becomes obsessed with traveling through the duct while Alain can't be bothered. As if this weren't enough for a 74-minute movie, Dupieux adds a subplot about Alain's boorish boss (Benoît Magimel) getting a transplant of an electronic remote-controlled penis. "Incredible But True" never deviates from a droll, matter-of-fact tone (beautifully handled by the cast) that constantly rubs against the preposterousness of the situation, not to mention its impossibility. The flourish on this delightful cake: a score entirely based on tracks from the synthesizer-heavy, Wendy Carlos-like album "Jon Santo Plays Bach," from 1976.
'Mousa'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Peter Mimi's "Mousa," from Egypt, is not unlike Joko Anwar's "Gundala," from Indonesia: Both films adapt superhero tropes familiar to North American viewers to a new setting and with a social-justice conscience. Both movies are rough-edged compared to similar Hollywood products, but it is fascinating to watch how familiar plot points emerge in a different context. Yehia (Kareem Mahmoud Abdel Aziz) is a brilliant engineering student crippled by terminal shyness. After watching, powerless, thugs burn his father alive in their home, the young man builds Mousa, a human-size robot controlled via a virtual-reality headset, and unleashes it on the criminal set -- Mousa, for example, goes after traffickers who kidnap children to sell their organs to the rich.
The film is overall less interested in robot-led action -- there are minimal set pieces, considering the subject -- than in people's reaction to it as Egyptians welcome a new folk hero. Unfortunately, some take exception to Mousa's actions and Yehia must face corrupt authorities embodied by his professor, Dr. Nassar (Eyad Nassar). Clearly the tradition of sneaking in messages about social ills under a sci-fi cover is alive and well.
'Head Rush'
Rent or buy it on Amazon.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An older man living in the middle of the Vietnamese countryside successfully performs a body transplant on his nephew. Far-fetched? Just a little, but then this is a column about science-fiction movies, not a guide to the Science Channel. When the mild-mannered cartoonist Tam (Cuong Seven) is diagnosed with terminal cancer, Uncle Ma (Hoang Son) grafts Tam's head onto a healthy stranger's body. In a nice touch, Tam must wear turtlenecks to hide his huge scar, making him a stylish medical miracle. But beware of transplanted parts that come with baggage: Because his unwitting donor, Nghia (Vu Tuan Viet), was a hit man, his past takes over Tam's life. Fortunately, Nghia's body appears to have retained a certain amount of muscle memory and while Tam finds himself embroiled in shady business, he also has inherited extraordinary abilities of the butt-kicking variety.
Victor Vu's film (released in Vietnam in 2017 but just streaming in the U.S.) features some primo chases and hand-to-hand combat, but its most arresting asset is the way it amusingly keeps coming up with melodramatic revelations. Forget about mixing and matching heads and bodies: The plot twists rely on family connections.

Marion Meade Dies at 88; Helped to Renew Interest In Dorothy Parker's Work: [Biography]

Author: Sandomir, Richard

Publication info: Sandomir, Richard. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/marion-meade-dies-at-88-helped-renew-interest/docview/2767729949/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her books also included biographies of Eleanor of Aquitaine and the suffragist leader Victoria Woodhull, as well as Buster Keaton and Woody Allen.
Marion Meade, who helped revive interest in Dorothy Parker, the celebrated writer and sardonic wit of the Algonquin Round Table, with her 1988 biography, died on Dec. 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.
Her granddaughter Ashley Sprague confirmed the death. She said that Ms. Meade had recently had Covid-19, but that a cause had not been determined.
Ms. Meade's "Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This?" detailed the vibrant if difficult life of a major figure on the literary scene of the 1920s and '30s.
Mrs. Parker joined Vanity Fair magazine as its drama critic at 24; coined well-known lines like "Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses" and "You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think"; and was a founding member of the round table at the Algonquin Hotel in Midtown Manhattan where she, the writer Robert Benchley, the critic Alexander Woollcott and others engaged in witty commentary.
But she drank too much, suffered from depression, had one failed marriage to Edwin Parker II and two marriages (and one divorce) to the screenwriter Alan Campbell. She tried to commit suicide twice. In 1930, when she could not finish a novel she had promised to her editor at Viking, Ms. Meade wrote, Mrs. Parker "panicked and drank a bottle of shoe polish," which sent her to the hospital.
Mrs. Parker died in 1967, having offered her own epitaph: "Excuse my dust."
Ms. Meade had already published a biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who in the 12th century was queen of both England and France, when she decided to turn her attention to another personality. Her focus was initially on the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, but she soon learned that another writer was working on her biography. She shifted her attention to Mrs. Parker -- whom she called "one of the funniest women of the 20th century, whose wit and good sense never fail to entertain me," in an essay many years later for Contemporary Authors.
"From time to time readers will say to me, 'Oh, she had such a sad life,"' she added. But, she said, she disagreed: While alcoholism and depression derailed her at times, she wrote, they "did not prevent her from being wildly successful, the multitalented author of verse, stories, plays, movie scripts and criticism."
Reviews of the book were mixed. Writing in The Pittsburgh Press, Roy McHugh called it an "admirably straightforward biography" that "explains more than is possible and excuses nothing." But in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote, "Parker's cynical wit, of course, cannot have made it easy for friends or biographers to penetrate her defensive armor, but instead of attempting to really come to terms with her emotional life, Ms Meade simply settles for catchphrases, attributing her problems to insecurity or self-loathing."
Kevin Fitzpatrick, president of the Dorothy Parker Society, said that the book elevated Mrs. Parker's profile enough to persuade Penguin Classics to rerelease collections of her short stories and poems in the 1990s. And, he said, Ms. Meade believed the screenplay of "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" (1994), directed by Alan Rudolph, written by Mr. Rudolph and Randy Sue Coburn and starring Jennifer Jason Leigh in the title role, was based in part on her biography.
"She talked to a lawyer, but she did not sue," Mr. Fitzpatrick said in a phone interview. "It was a low point for her."
Marion Lolita Sidhu was born on Jan. 7, 1934, in Pittsburgh. Her father, Surain Sidhu, an Indian immigrant, was a physicist who directed the X-ray laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh and later worked on top secret research at the Argonne National Laboratory. Her mother, Mary (Homoney) Sidhu, was a homemaker.
Marion's desire to be a writer started in childhood. She studied journalism at Northwestern University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1955.
Arriving in Manhattan later that year to attend the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, she quickly headed to the Algonquin, sat on a settee in the lobby's cocktail lounge, lit up a cigarette, ordered a Tom Collins and soaked in the view that must have been familiar to Mrs. Parker.
After receiving her master's degree in 1956, she spent a year interviewing celebrities and checking facts for the syndicated gossip columnist Earl Wilson.
Over the next two decades, Ms. Meade freelanced for publications including McCall's, Cosmopolitan and The Village Voice; and joined the New York Radical Feminists, a group that occupied the offices of Ladies' Home Journal for 11 hours in 1970 and secured a promise, which was fulfilled, to put out a special "women's liberation" supplement in a forthcoming issue. She was also a longtime editor at Aviation Week magazine.
Her first book, "Bitching," was based on her conversations with women about the female experience and how they felt about men, was published in 1973. She followed that in 1976 with a biography of Victoria Woodhull, a leader of the women's suffrage movement.
Ms. Meade's "Eleanor of Aquitaine" (1977) was praised by the critic Robert Kirsch of The Los Angeles Times for her "almost uncanny empathy for her subject," which he said made it appear as if "she can view the world through Eleanor's eyes."
She spent seven years researching and writing the Parker book. She followed it with biographies of the silent film comedian Buster Keaton in 1995 and Woody Allen in 2000. She returned to Dorothy Parker in 2004 with "Bobbed Hair and Bathtub Gin: Writers Running Wild in the Twenties," a joint portrait of four writers: Mrs. Parker, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Zelda Fitzgerald and Edna Ferber.
In addition to Ms. Sprague, she is survived by another granddaughter, Katharine Sprague; her daughter, Alison Linkhorn; and one great-granddaughter. Her marriages to Charles Meade, Forbes Linkhorn and the writer Milton Viorst, who died last month, ended in divorce.
Ms. Meade returned a few times to her best-known subject. She edited and wrote the introduction to a new edition of "The Portable Dorothy Parker" (2006). In 2014, she expanded on a 2006 Bookforum article about Mrs. Parker in a Kindle book, "The Last Days of Dorothy Parker."
In that book, she touched on the saga of how the urn with Mrs. Parker's ashes ended up being stowed in Manhattan in a file cabinet belonging to the veteran New York City politician Paul O'Dwyer, who was the lawyer for the writer Lillian Hellman, the literary executor of the Parker estate. (The urn, after a circuitous journey, was finally buried in 2020 at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.)
In 1987, Ms. Meade called Mr. O'Dwyer to say she was going to visit the cemetery in Westchester where she thought the urn had been buried. With her biography of Mrs. Parker complete and Ms. Hellman dead, Ms. Meade wanted to pay her respects.
"Oh, she's not there," Mr. O'Dwyer told her.
"Of course she is," Ms. Meade said.
"No, no," Mr. O'Dwyer said, "I'm looking right at her."

The Era of Happy Tech Workers Is Over: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Silicon Valley as we know it -- with its radically transparent company cultures, empowered employees, flat hierarchies and rarefied perks like nap pods and free food -- is quickly disappearing. And it's unlikely to return.
For nearly two decades, tech companies heralded an approach that centered on making workers happy with benefits that were intended to seamlessly integrate work and life. They made well-being programs and unlimited vacation, initiatives that prioritized the whole person, standard employee benefits. This, along with high salaries and equity packages, was a way not just to win but also to dominate the war for talent. The rapid growth and success of Silicon Valley companies, driven in part by their unique people practices, reimagined workplace culture for a generation.
Times, as they say, are a-changin'. The industry is facing an uneven macroeconomic environment and a roiling stock market that is putting pressure on public tech companies and making for a less-than-ideal I.P.O. environment for private ones. Tech chief executives are now optimizing more for profitability than for growth at all costs, sometimes at the expense of long-held organizational beliefs.
The shift is most evident in the recent surge of tech layoffs. There has been lots of public discussion about the disruptive axing of half of Twitter's 7,500 employees, a move conducted under its new owner, Elon Musk. Haphazard and rolling, the layoffs were painful to watch. The employees who remained have had to endure greater workloads on significantly smaller teams. But while outsiders may have viewed these layoffs as impulsive, they seemed to have primed the environment for other tech companies to follow. In 2022, the tech industry laid off over 150,000 people. In the first few weeks of 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts and Alphabet followed with 12,000.
According to multiple media outlets, Meta and Amazon use stack ranking for their employees, a controversial approach in evaluating talent. Popularized by G.E. in the 1980s (though the company later abandoned it), the process has managers rate their employees on a forced curve. Generally, only 20 percent are deemed top talent, and 10 to 15 percent must be designated as low performers. Although there are benefits, even in the best of times, the practice can create a competitive work environment that de-emphasizes employee improvement. With impending layoffs, people with the lowest ranking are typically the first to go.
The layoffs are part of a new age of bossism, the notion that management has given up too much control and must wrest it back from employees. After two decades of fighting for talent, chief executives are using this period to adjust for years of management indulgence that left them with a generation of entitled workers.
In 2012, to spur innovation and drive engagement, LinkedIn began the incubator program. A perk that encouraged employees to come up with approved ideas that they could work on full time for up to three months was generous even by Silicon Valley standards. Then there were the many lavish events that served to put a company's culture on display. It was par for the course for employees to attend elaborately themed holiday parties featuring the next new Instagrammable experience. If you happened to work at Uber in 2015 and attended its corporate event in Las Vegas, you were treated to a private performance from Beyoncé.
Executives across industries are leaning into their newfound bossism and ending pandemic-era work arrangements and incentives. Reed Hastings, Netflix's co-founder and co-C.E.O., said near the start of the pandemic that he didn't "see any positives" in working from home, and the company apparently allows only some remote work. TikTok reportedly told employees that it was sunsetting gym membership and Wi-Fi reimbursements as well as its $ 45 daily meal stipends to workers not tied to the company's main hubs, in its own efforts at restraint. These changes are bellwethers.
Not all tech employees see these shifts as signals. I recently spoke with a product marketing manager from Meta who was laid off. I assumed that she would be apprehensive about her job prospects; instead, armed with three months' severance and decent savings, she remains optimistic. With nearly 79 percent of software engineers and nearly 76 percent of marketers who were laid off in tech finding jobs within three months, her optimism isn't necessarily unfounded.
However, a few things are true now that make the shift in tech employee culture not just a moment in time but also a redefinition of how tech companies will be run.
Meta and Salesforce combined lost more than $ 700 billion in market cap last year. Both companies are now dealing with activist investors who have taken prominent positions in their stocks. The activists have called for the companies to slash costs, reduce nonstrategic investments and, notably in Meta's case, aggressively reduce its work force. Managers have less capacity to overhire and invest in employee initiatives that aren't tied directly to business execution.
For tech start-ups and founder-C.E.O.s, the past 10 years were a bull run. Interest rates were low, venture funding seemed limitless and valuations skyrocketed. With money being essentially free, founder-C.E.O.s dived in -- pursuing revenue, increasing their customer bases and investing in myriad people and projects.
However, with recent interest rates the highest they have been since late 2007 and continuing market uncertainty, investors are considering more investments in companies with strong fundamentals and cash flows. For founder-C.E.O.s, this means it will be harder to raise funding, and investors will have an even greater expectation of return on their money. For large tech companies and start-ups alike, cash is no longer free, and employee investments must pay off.
We are entering an era of external investor pressure, higher financing hurdles and overall market volatility. This environment calls for management to make structural changes in the way workplace culture is experienced for both labor and capital.
The current tech work force is used to every voice getting a vote, and it will now have to yield to a new world -- one with heightened expectations and disciplined investment. Not considering the winds of change will put the careers of many empowered workers at risk.

For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn’t hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has — and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft — have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. They pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.
AMAZON
1.54 million employees – 18,000 layoffs = 1.2% of workforce “As part of our annual planning process for 2023, leaders across the company have been working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year’s review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we’ve hired rapidly over the last several years.”
— Andy Jassy, CEO,
Jan. 4
ALPHABET
186,779 employees – 12,000 layoffs = 6.4% of workforce
“I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here. Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.”
— Sundar Pichai, CEO,
Jan. 20
META
87,314 employees – 11,000 layoffs = 12.6% of workforce
“At the start of COVID, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”
— Mark Zuckerberg, CEO,
Nov. 9
MICROSOFT
221,000 employees – 10,000 layoffs = 4.5% of workforce
“We’re living through times of significant change, and as I meet with customers and partners, a few things are clear. First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we’re now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more with less.”
— Satya Nadella, CEO,

Vox Media To Cut Staff By 7 Percent Amid Worries: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company, which publishes New York magazine, The Verge and numerous other brands, joins a parade of tech and media companies cutting back staff amid economic uncertainty.
Vox Media, which owns brands like The Verge, SB Nation and New York magazine, said on Friday that it would cut about 7 percent of its staff, joining a parade of tech and media companies laying off workers amid economic uncertainty.
In a morning email to the staff, Jim Bankoff, Vox's chief executive, said the company needed to become smaller in the face of a downturn, adding that the company had already reduced its spending and frozen new hiring.
"Unfortunately, in this economic climate, we're not able to sustain projects and areas of the business that have not performed as anticipated, are less core to where we see the biggest opportunities in the coming years, or where we don't have enough rationale to support ongoing investment in what could be a prolonged downturn," he wrote.
Mr. Bankoff did not disclose whether the cuts would come from all of the company's brands, but said the affected teams included revenue, editorial, operations and core services. The company has about 1,900 employees, a spokeswoman for Vox Media said. She declined to comment further on the cuts.
Mr. Bankoff said staff whose roles had been eliminated would be notified on Friday, and senior leadership would soon provide more details on the extent of the layoffs.
Mr. Bankoff said the company was "fundamentally strong," adding, "These setbacks are driven primarily by the temporal macroeconomic forces that are impacting nearly all businesses in our sector."
The Vox Media Union said in a statement, "We're furious at the way the company has approached these layoffs, and are currently discussing how to best serve those who just lost their jobs."
Last year, Vox Media merged with Group Nine, the publisher of lifestyle websites like PopSugar and Thrillist, to become one of the country's largest digital media companies. It cut about 3 percent of its work force in March after the merger, and another 39 workers in July. The deal was part of a wave of consolidation in the industry in the past few years as publishers sought to expand so they could better compete for online ad revenues.
But ad spending across the sector has fallen in recent months as the economy has slowed. Media and tech industries have experienced mass layoffs as companies try to cut costs.
CNN and Gannett laid off hundreds of workers at the end of last year. The publisher of The Washington Post announced a plan for layoffs in December. Tech behemoths like Amazon, Microsoft and Google and have recently said they would cut thousands of jobs.

Alphabet Announces Plans To Lay Off 12,000 Workers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The layoffs amount to about 6 percent of the global work force at the company, the latest tech giant to make cuts after a pandemic hiring spree.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Friday that it planned to cut 12,000 jobs, becoming the latest technology company to reduce its work force because of concerns about a broader economic slowdown, after a hiring spree during the pandemic.
The job cuts are the company's largest ever, amounting to about 6 percent of its global work force. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Alphabet had expanded too rapidly during the pandemic, when demand for digital services boomed, and must refocus on products and technology core to its future, like artificial intelligence.
"We hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today," Mr. Pichai said in a note to employees posted on the company's website.
Google joins a list of technology companies that have laid off workers after concluding they overextended under the belief that the pandemic-fueled boom represented a new normal. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Twitter are among others that have announced thousands of job cuts.
Technology firms have cut more than 190,000 jobs since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks the industry.
The moves mark the end of a period of rapid expansion in the technology industry, which battled for employees with lavish perks and high pay. Google, started in 1998, helped define a work culture that influenced corporations far beyond Silicon Valley.
Alphabet, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., had nearly 187,000 employees at the end of September, up from about 150,000 a year earlier.
In a note titled "A difficult decision to set us up for the future," Mr. Pichai said the job cuts would run across product areas, job responsibilities and locations. That future includes increased competition from rivals offering new ways to search for information on the internet; ChatGPT, a popular chatbot created by OpenAI, has dazzled users by providing clearly written answers to questions and queries.
"These are important moments to sharpen our focus, re-engineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities," Mr. Pichai said. "Being constrained in some areas allows us to bet big on others."
Last month, Google declared a "code red" in response to ChatGPT, with Mr. Pichai upending existing projects to concentrate on the field of artificial intelligence. With the job cuts, Google chipped away at efforts that are lower priorities.
Google Research, a pillar of the A.I. initiatives, cut roles in areas that have gotten less traction, including health care, according to an email that Jeff Dean, the senior vice president for research, health and A.I., sent to his employees. The company plans to streamline its investments in Google for Clinicians, a tool for health care providers. Google and Alphabet also consolidated robotics efforts, Mr. Dean added.
Google Cloud, which has hired at a breakneck pace over the last several years, also saw cuts. "Today's news primarily impacted positions that were non-customer facing, non-engineering and operational in nature," Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's chief executive, wrote in an email to employees. He added that the division would continue to hire in strategic areas, including product development and customer-related roles, to bolster its growth.
X, Alphabet's "moonshot factory," which incubates new companies, fired members of its strategy and business operations team, said two people with knowledge of the cuts, who were not authorized to discuss them. Many of the companies that were created in X have struggled to generate significant revenue and become profitable.
There were reductions in other parts of the company. Google fired 16 percent of its Fuchsia team, which had about 400 people working on operating systems for the company's home devices, one person said. A team in data center maintenance experienced cuts. Other engineers, user-experience researchers and product designers were also affected.
Even as Alphabet and other tech giants trim their work forces and pledge to become more efficient, they remain hugely profitable. In 2021, Alphabet had profit of $ 76 billion and revenue of nearly $ 258 billion.
The Alphabet Workers Union, which represents 1,100 members, criticized the cuts.
"With billions in profits and executive compensation untouched, our jobs should not be on the chopping block," Parul Koul, the union's executive chair, said in a statement.
But the technology industry has not been immune from rising interest rates and a slumping global economy. As the advertising market struggles and companies buy fewer ads on Google's search engine or on YouTube, which Google owns, Alphabet's bottom line took a hit. The company's cloud computing business has continued to trail Amazon and Microsoft. In October, Alphabet said quarterly net profit had fallen 27 percent.
Wall Street analysts hailed Alphabet's move. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI wrote in a research note that the job cuts were a necessary step to preserve profit. After the cuts were announced Friday, Alphabet's stock price rose more than 5 percent. The company will report its financial results for 2022 on Feb. 2.
Many employees at Google had been bracing for cuts as other large tech firms announced job losses. The closure of some small offices, and the release of a new employee evaluation system that was seen as a way to identify underperformers, signaled to many workers that the company was preparing for layoffs.
The layoffs were announced in the middle of the night in the United States, while many of the affected employees were asleep. They awoke to text messages, news stories and, in some cases, the realization that they no longer had access to Google's corporate systems.
Chewy Shaw, a site reliability engineer for YouTube who was let go on Friday, said the scale and speed of the layoffs was infuriating. "The authorities on high can come down at any surprising moment and just snap their finger and you're gone," Mr. Shaw said.
Alphabet said U.S. employees would receive a severance package that included 16 weeks of salary, plus two weeks of extra pay for every year they had worked at Google. Laid-off workers will receive six months of paid health care. Compensation for workers outside the United States will be determined by local labor laws, the company said.

Sales of P.&G. Goods Fall for First Time in 5 Years
Procter & Gamble's sales fell for the first time in more than five years last quarter, the company reported on Thursday, as shoppers pulled back in the face of relentlessly rising prices. The maker of household staples like Tide detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Charmin toilet paper saw sales fall 1 percent in the three months through December, versus a year earlier, the first annual decline since mid-2017. Profit also fell for a second consecutive quarter, sliding 7 percent. Both sales and earnings were hurt by changes in foreign exchange rates, the company said. Procter & Gamble raised prices 10 percent last quarter from a year earlier, up from a 9 percent price increase in the previous quarter. But sales volume, or the amount of products consumers bought, fell 6 percent, twice the 3 percent decline in the previous quarter. Shares of Procter & Gamble fell nearly 3 percent by the close of trading. ISABELLA SIMONETTI
LABOR
Union Membership Rate Drops to a Record Low
The U.S. union membership rate reached a record low last year despite high-profile unionization campaigns at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and other companies. Union members fell to 10.1 percent of the American work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down slightly from 10.3 percent in 2021. The number of workers belonging to a union actually increased by 1.9 percent to 14.3 million. But that failed to keep pace with higher overall employment rates. The number of wage- and salaryearning workers rose by 3.9 percent, the government said. In 1983, the first year that comparable data is available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent, the government said. Public-sector workers, like police and teachers, had the highest unionization rates last year, at 33 percent. Just 6 percent of privatesector workers were unionized. Automation, outsourcing and lower unionization rates in traditional union strongholds, like auto manufacturing, are among the reasons for the steady decline. ASSOCIATED PRESS
HACKING
T-Mobile Discloses a Major Security Breach
T-Mobile said on Thursday that a hacker had collected data, including names, birth dates and phone numbers, from 37 million customer accounts, the company's second major breach in less than two years. In a securities filing, T-Mobile said it first discovered that a "bad actor" was obtaining the data on Jan. 5. With help from outside cybersecurity experts, the mobile service provider stopped the leak the next day, it said. The company said there was no evidence its systems or network had been compromised, adding that the mechanism the hacker exploited did not provide access to more sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers. The exposed information did include billing and email addresses, and T-Mobile account numbers. "We understand that an incident like this has an impact on our customers and regret that this occurred," T-Mobile said in a statement. NIRAJ CHOKSHI

In Davos, a Skirmish Over the Role Oil States Play in Climate Talks: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: John Kerry defended the choice of an oil executive to run the next climate talks while Greta Thunberg and others raised an alarm.
DAVOS, Switzerland -- John Kerry on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of the decision to hold this year's United Nations climate talks in the United Arab Emirates, one of the world's largest oil producers, suggesting the Gulf state was rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels and would not compromise the integrity of the negotiations.
"Don't judge a book by its cover," Mr. Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy, said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
The United Arab Emirates, selected by the United Nations to host the November talks, has faced withering criticism from climate activists over its selection of Sultan Al Jaber, the head of its national oil company, to oversee the climate talks.
Mr. Kerry has worked closely with Mr. Al Jaber for years and called him a "good friend," adding that he believed the oil executive "would be a very serious and focused interlocutor on this."
He added that the United Arab Emirates, a major strategic ally of the United States, was moving rapidly to embrace renewable energy and reduce its planet-warming emissions in agriculture and other areas.
"There's an advantage to having a petrostate that is actually in the forefront of some of these cutting edge initiatives," Mr. Kerry said. "I think the U.A.E. is serious about it."
Hours after Mr. Kerry spoke, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, appeared in Davos and assailed the choice.
"Lobbyists have been influencing these conferences since basically forever and this puts a very clear face to it," she said at a news conference, wearing the muddy boots she had on when she was detained by the police while protesting a coal mine in Germany on Tuesday. "It's completely ridiculous."
Ms. Thunberg was joined by three other young female climate activists, Helena Gualinga of Ecuador, Vanessa Nakate of Uganda and Luisa Neubauer of Germany. The four have launched an online petition demanding that energy companies stop new oil, gas and coal projects.
Ms. Gualinga dismissed the idea that substantive negotiations over climate action could occur in the United Arab Emirates. "There's a huge conflict of interest there," she said. "It sends this message of not taking it seriously."
The climate protesters were joined at the news conference by Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. Mr. Birol called for a rapid winding down of fossil fuels.
Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking at the main Davos conference and at side events, also lent his support to the activists.
"The appearance of a conflict of interest undermines confidence at a time when climate activists around the world, and I'm partly speaking for them right here on this stage, have come to the conclusion that the people in authority are not doing their job," a fiery Mr. Gore said in a panel discussion on Wednesday. "There's a lot of 'blah blah blah,' as Greta says, there are a lot of words, and there are some meaningful commitments. But we are still failing badly."
"We cannot let the oil companies and gas companies and petrostates tell us what is permissible," Mr. Gore added.
At last year's United Nations climate talks, known as COP27 and held in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, representatives from Saudi Arabia blocked language in the final agreement that would have called for a phasing out of fossil fuels.
Jo Sheldon, a spokeswoman for COP28, the talks scheduled for November, said Mr. Al Jaber was "an energy expert and founder of one of the world's leading renewable energy companies, a senior business leader, government minister and climate diplomat with more than 20 years of experience of taking climate action."
"He is uniquely qualified to deliver a successful COP28," Ms. Sheldon said. "He is determined to make COP28 a COP for all. And to make truly transformational progress it is critical that all stakeholders are at the table."
With the Russian war against Ukraine creating an energy crisis that has had the short-term effect of spurring more fossil fuel production, greenhouse gas emissions have reached a record high, even as solar, wind and other renewable sources are growing.
On Wednesday, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, issued a stern warning to the crowd gathered at Davos.
"We are flirting with climate disaster," Mr. Guterres said. "Every week brings a new climate horror story. Greenhouse gas emissions are at record levels."
Mr. Guterres added that the consequences of runaway warming "will be devastating" and that "several parts of our planet will be uninhabitable. And for many, this is a death sentence."
Meanwhile, business leaders sought to highlight their companies' eco-friendly bona fides.
On the main street of Davos, an Alpine resort town transformed into a giant trade show for the week, multinational corporations plastered idealistic slogans on storefronts they had transformed into temporary offices.
A Salesforce billboard featuring a smiling brown bear proclaimed that "Business is the greatest platform for change." Uber advertised that it was offering "All-electric Uber Green rides" all week in Davos. And the offices of SAP, the technology giant, featured the slogan, "When you put people first, we build a sustainable world together."
The World Economic Forum program featured a heavy dose of panel discussions and other programs addressing climate change and efforts to reduce emissions.
"Climate is top of the agenda," Jason Bordoff, a dean at the Columbia University Climate School said in an interview at the event. "The sense of urgency is not abating, but there is a new sense of realism that the gap between reality and ambition is getting bigger, not smaller. Now we need to make sure that the reality catches up with the ambition, and we need to meet people's energy needs along the way."
Marina Silva, Brazil's minister of environment and climate change, spoke on Tuesday and said that the newly installed government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was committed to helping stop planetary warming by protecting the Amazon rain forest.
"We are back to the international agenda to talk about climate, to talk about ambitious targets for the climate and biodiversity," Ms. Silva said.
While temperatures remained below freezing for most of the week, an abnormally warm winter has left much of the area with far less snow than usual, a reminder of the changing climate. In Davos, some ski runs were shuttered and the winter sledging run, a popular diversion for overwhelmed conference attendees, was closed for a lack of snow.

Amid Struggles, Post Gets a Visit From Its Owner: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With questions hovering about the financial performance of the news organization, its billionaire owner checked in with senior leaders.
The Washington Post has been battling declining ad revenue and stalled online subscription growth. The question hovering over it in recent months: What does Jeff Bezos think?
The Amazon founder, who bought the news organization in 2013, has said nothing publicly about The Post's recent struggles. But on Thursday, he made a rare appearance in the newsroom, joining the morning news meeting for the first time in more than a year.
He still said little. "I'm delighted to be here and see all these faces," Mr. Bezos said, according to three people with knowledge of his remarks, before asking The Post's top editor, Sally Buzbee, about her recent trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Thank you for allowing me to listen in," he continued.
"Great," Ms. Buzbee said. "Let's have a news meeting."
But the meeting -- with Mr. Bezos seated next to Ms. Buzbee at a large conference table in a glass-walled conference room on the sixth floor, with the publisher, Fred Ryan, sitting nearby -- signaled that he was paying attention.
"Jeff is here for in-person meetings with Fred, Sally and staff across the newsroom," a Post spokeswoman said in an email.
Other than Mr. Bezos' appearance, the news meeting proceeded as it might on any other day, with editors discussing news stories and readership trends, according to the people with knowledge of the meeting. At one point, an editor mentioned plans to run an article about the discontinuation of AmazonSmile, a charity program that Mr. Bezos championed. The editors also discussed the pending sale of the Washington Commanders. The Post previously reported that Mr. Bezos was interested in buying the National Football League team.
The Post rapidly expanded after Mr. Bezos, one of the world's richest people, bought the company for $ 250 million, substantially adding newsroom jobs and increasing its coverage areas. But the business has stalled in the past year.
Last month, Mr. Ryan told staff members in a tense meeting that there would be layoffs. A Post spokeswoman said in a statement at the time that the job cuts were intended to "put our business in the best position for future growth." The layoffs, which Mr. Ryan said would be a single-digit percentage of staff, are expected to take place early this year.
During the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Bezos' retinue stood outside the room, earpieces clearly visible. As he left, a Post employee wearing a red shirt emblazoned with the insignia of The Post's union guild stopped him and asked why the company was laying people off without offering buyouts first, according to the three people with knowledge of the meeting. Mr. Bezos responded that he was at The Post to listen, not answer questions, and underscored his commitment to The Post's journalism.
The guild said in a statement on Thursday: "We hope that Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has heard employees' appeals for a stop to these impending layoffs that, as far as we can tell, are not financially necessary or rooted in any informed business strategy from publisher Fred Ryan." At least 60 people have joined the guild since Mr. Ryan announced the layoffs, the union said.
Mr. Bezos' visit was seen internally as an indication of his commitment to the future of the publication, which had been in question. He met with top editors including Cameron Barr, Krissah Thompson, Lori Montgomery, Matea Gold and Phil Rucker, as well as a political reporter, Josh Dawsey, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The Post was on track to end 2022 in the red after years of profitability, The New York Times reported in August. The Post has struggled to expand its subscription business, with fewer paying subscribers last year than the three million it had in 2020, a presidential election year.
In recent months, The Post has had an exodus of talent, including its chief information officer, chief communications officer and chief product officer. Several of its top journalists have also left to work at rival publications.

Remote Work Takes a Toll On Downtown Lunch Spots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Downtown lunch spots that rely on catering to white-collar professionals are rethinking their business model as more employees work from home.
It's a tough time for companies that cater to the needs of office workers. For some, like downtown lunch spots that rely on servicing white-collar professionals, remote work options could pose an existential risk.
Sweetgreen, the fast-casual salad chain, is feeling the pain, the DealBook newsletter reports. Its stock has fallen more than 60 percent in the past 12 months. In November, the company noted the effect of the shift to hybrid working practices in its third-quarter earnings report. Inflation is also making its already premium-priced salads even more expensive, pushing the cost of a Cobb salad to around $ 14 in Manhattan.
Companies in the nation's downtown districts that depend on the spending of office workers are wondering whether business will come back. CBRE, the commercial real estate firm, says the role of the office is changing permanently. A survey of big office tenants found that 71 percent of respondents were looking to expand hybrid work arrangements in the next three years.
Layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, are also leaving office spaces empty. On Wednesday, Microsoft became the latest tech giant to announce job cuts as it tries to trim costs, following on the heels of similar announcements from Amazon, Meta, Salesforce and others.
Higher interest rates are also weighing on the commercial real estate sector as many landlords are stuck with aging office buildings that have become too expensive to upgrade. Compounding the problem, tenants are not renewing their leases and instead opting for smaller spaces.
Those industry trends could pose a long-term risk for companies like Sweetgreen, which has been pushing online options to replace in-person sales. For now, analysts are still bullish on the company because it has moved to build digital sales and loyalty. In the third quarter, 60 percent of Sweetgreen's orders were made through online channels, compared with 37 percent at Chipotle and about 40 percent across Yum Brands, and Sweetgreen is piloting a subscription service.
Mitch Reback, Sweetgreen's chief financial officer, noted on a call with analysts in August that the "erratic urban recovery" caused a "sales growth lag," but he said he remained "confident" that downtown locations would recover. The company laid off 5 percent of its work force last year.

With little warning or regulation, companies are increasingly using facial recognition technology on their customers -- as a security measure, they say.
But what happens when the systems are actually being used to punish the companies' enemies?
On today's episode
Kashmir Hill, a technology reporter for The New York Times.
Background reading
Madison Square Garden Entertainment, the owner of the arena, has put lawyers who represent people suing it on an "exclusion list" to keep them out of concerts and sporting events.
Some have undermined the company's ban by using a law passed in 1941 to protect theater critics.
There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily. Here's how.
We aim to make transcripts available the next workday after an episode's publication. You can find them at the top of the page.

Retail Sales Fell in December as Holiday Shoppers Cut Back: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Weaker-than-expected results, including at popular holiday shopping destinations like electronics outlets and department stores, showed how concerns about inflation are affecting consumers.
Retail sales fell in December, highlighting how consumers' concerns about inflation became the defining factor of the holiday shopping season.
U.S. retail sales fell 1.1 percent from the month before, the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday. While the data is adjusted for seasonal variations, it does not account for price changes, and inflation continued to ease during December, which would have contributed to the decline.
Retail sales in November were also revised to show a fall of 1 percent from October, worse than the 0.6 percent decline originally reported.
Sales were down in December at popular holiday shopping destinations like electronics stores, car dealerships and clothing outlets. Department stores posted a 6.6 percent decline from the previous month.
Other categories also took a hit, as stubbornly high inflation, rising interest rates and a slowing economy squeezed wallets. While there was a slight uptick in December sales at grocery stores, spending at restaurants, bars and health and personal care stores recorded a decline.
"The decline in December retail sales, which is on top of the decline in November, demonstrates that there are cracks appearing in the resiliency that consumers have shown in 2022," Mickey Chadha, retail analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said in an emailed statement.
Analysts will get a better perspective of how individual retailers performed during the crucial holiday shopping season when companies like Walmart, Target and Macy's report their fourth-quarter earnings next month. Macy's and Lululemon already warned Wall Street that aspects of their holiday performances were weaker than expected.
This year, retailers are bracing for consumers to spend more selectively than earlier in the pandemic, when shoppers bought goods with the help of government stimulus. The first few months of the year are usually slow ones for retailers, after the holiday rush.
Bed Bath & Beyond said this month that it was exploring a potential bankruptcy, as it continued to lose shoppers and sales. Party City said on Tuesday that it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as the company faced rising prices and consumers pulled back on spending.
Layoffs are also hitting some of the stronger players in retail. Amazon on Wednesday started a round of layoffs that will eliminate 18,000 corporate and technology jobs, or about 6 percent of its corporate work force.

New FIFA Corruption Trial to Focus on Fox TV Rights: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two former executives are accused of paying bribes to obtain broadcast rights, including for the World Cup. Testimony could reveal what the company knew.
The World Cup may be over, but the FIFA corruption scandal never seems to end.
Nearly eight years after a series of predawn raids exposed corruption at the highest levels of international soccer, and more than five years after the conclusion of the first trial in the Justice Department's sprawling probe of bribery in the sport, a second trial is set to begin on Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn.
Once more, the defendants stand accused of being involved in complex schemes to pay millions of dollars in exchange for the rights to matches. Once more, prosecutors are expected to focus on the same tournaments and to rely on many of the same witnesses. They will make their arguments before the same judge in the same courtroom and, they hope, they will add three more convictions to the long-running case's already impressive ledger: to date, the government has netted 29 convictions in the case.
But after years of focusing on soccer officials and sporting bureaucrats, the new trial has the potential for a dramatic twist: revelations about the involvement of one of FIFA's most important media partners, Fox Corporation, in a secretive scheme to pay millions of dollars in bribes to enhance its position in international soccer -- and to seize the sport's biggest broadcasting prize, the rights to the World Cup itself, from a rival network.
Fox itself is not on trial. But the fact that two of its former executives have been accused of orchestrating bribes, hiding payments and trafficking in insider information could damage the reputation of the $ 17 billion media giant and breathe fresh relevance into a corruption investigation that once captured worldwide attention but which long ago faded from the news.
"This case involves a legacy business that has no connection to the new Fox Corporation," a spokesman for the company said in a statement. "We have cooperated fully and respect the judicial process." The spokesman added that the Fox subsidiary accused of involvement in bribes, which was part of a company then known as 21st Century Fox, was sold in 2019.
Since the conclusion of the last trial, FIFA, soccer's governing body, which is based in Zurich, has managed to stage two World Cups -- in Russia in 2018 and Qatar last year -- and bank record revenue, all while casting itself as the victim of its own corruption. It has been a successful strategy: Last summer, the Justice Department returned $ 92 million of the money it had recovered in the case to FIFA and its federations, part of a plan to award the soccer bodies more than $ 200 million in restitution overall.
Gianni Infantino, the current FIFA president, has repeatedly made the claim that the organization he leads is now free of corruption. But the case, at least in the view of the Justice Department, is far from over.
In the trial that begins this week, Hernán López, the former chief executive of Fox International Channels, and Carlos Martínez, who served as president of the subsidiary's Latin American operations, face wire fraud and money laundering charges. Prosecutors have accused them of running a scheme to pay bribes to "advance the interests of Fox" and help the company secure television broadcast rights to both the popular Copa Libertadores, the South American club championship, and the World Cup. If found guilty, López and Martínez face up to 20 years in prison.
A third defendant in the trial, the Argentine sports marketing firm Full Play Group SA, faces a laundry list of charges for what prosecutors described as years of bribe-paying to win rights to tournaments. If convicted, it could join a short and ignominious list of corporations found guilty of felonies in the United States, among them banks, energy companies and the Trump Organization.
Lawyers for all three defendants declined to discuss the case, as did a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York. But new convictions in federal court could help prosecutors justify the millions of dollars spent on an investigation that began in secret more than a dozen years ago and long ago more than proved its point: that global soccer has a profound corruption problem and -- critically -- that almost nothing is outside the reach of American justice.
The trial in Brooklyn, which is expected to last four to six weeks, largely concerns activities in South America. According to the March 2020 indictment, López, who holds American and Argentine citizenship, and Martínez, a dual citizen of the United States and Mexico, helped pay and conceal "annual bribe and kickback payments" to at least 14 soccer officials to secure television rights to two lucrative annual club championships, the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana.
Prosecutors also contend that López and Martínez used relationships forged through bribes to obtain "confidential information" from a top FIFA executive from Argentina that helped the company secure the American broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Rights to the event had been held by ESPN since the 1994 edition of the tournament, but in 2011, Fox announced it had snatched them away. Four years later, FIFA announced it had also awarded Fox rights to the incredibly lucrative 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, without so much as giving ESPN a chance to bid.
The allegations involving Fox appear to match 2017 trial testimony given by Alejandro Burzaco, the former chief executive of the Argentine sports marketing firm Torneos, who pleaded guilty in the case and has been cooperating with the government.
As the prosecution's star witness, he claimed López and Martínez helped cover up $ 3.7 million in bribes by using a phony contract with a firm partially owned by Fox.
Fox has denied any knowledge of any bribes, saying at the time that "any suggestion that Fox Sports knew of or approved of any bribes is emphatically false." López and Martínez have emphatically denied the charges against them in court filings, claiming that any bribes would have been paid by Burzaco.
López left Fox in January 2016, seven months after the first indictment in the FIFA case, and subsequently founded the podcasting company Wondery, which he sold to Amazon for a reported $ 300 million nine months after he was indicted in the soccer case.
Both his fate, and that of Martínez, may depend heavily on new testimony from Burzaco, who is once again expected to be the government's chief witness -- and, potentially, the source of any major revelations.

How to Focus, Screen to Screen: [Science Desk]

Full text: Smartphones, pings and Insta-everything have shortened our attention spans. Get some old-school concentration back with these tips.
In 2004, Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, watched knowledge workers go about a typical day at the office. Using a stopwatch, she noted every time they switched tasks on their computer, moving from a spreadsheet to an email to a web page to a different web page and back to the spreadsheet. She found that people averaged just two and a half minutes on a given task before switching.
When Dr. Mark repeated the experiment in 2012, the average time office workers spent on a task had dropped to 75 seconds. And it has continued to drop from there.
"Our attention spans while on our computers and smartphones have become short -- crazily short -- as we now spend about 47 seconds on any screen on average," Dr. Mark wrote in her new book, "Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity."
Anyone who's tried to study for an exam, write a report or read a book knows how hard it is to concentrate for significant chunks of time. Typically, digital devices are to blame for the disruption. The internet is omniscient, our phones omnipotent, and together they demand and destroy our concentration. Even when we really try to focus on a task, we often find we can't, our eyes glazing over and our thoughts drifting.
Fortunately, there are ways to wrest back control of your attention. They don't require swearing off technology altogether, but you do need some self-restraint and a few well-timed alarms.
First, understand what's distracting you.
Notifications are one major source of distraction -- those pings and dings pull you out of your work and prompt you to check your texts, email or Slack. Because our brains are evolutionarily designed to pay attention to novelty, these alerts are almost impossible to ignore. And if you try to, you'll likely find your anxiety mounting.
In one diabolical study, psychologists brought heavy and moderate smartphone users into the lab under the auspices of a different experiment. They hooked the participants up to skin conductance monitors, which measure levels of arousal, and took away their phones, telling them that they interfered with the research equipment. Then the researchers texted the participants multiple times; the phones were close enough to hear but too far away to check.
When their phones buzzed, the participants' arousal levels spiked. "They felt like they needed to answer that text or at least see who it was from, and they couldn't," said Larry Rosen, a professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills and a co-author on the study. "And that gave them anxiety."
Turning off notifications is a good way to reduce distractions -- indeed, it's a classic tip -- but it won't completely solve the problem. In her research on office workers, Dr. Mark found that external distractions accounted for only half of the interruptions in focus. The other half were prompted by an internal motivation to switch tasks. Most interesting, Dr. Mark observed that when the number of external interruptions waned, the number of self-interruptions rose.
"We get into this pattern of having short attention spans," she said. "And if we're not being interrupted by something external to us, then we switch gears and begin to interrupt ourselves."
Dr. Rosen hypothesizes that these urges to self-distract are caused by stress. Research shows that heavier smartphone use is correlated with higher levels of cortisol and other markers of stress. Rising anxiety could become an internal signal to look at your texts or Twitter, even without a chime or vibration. When there are no notifications, Dr. Rosen said, people "get a strong internal sign from their anxiety system that says, 'Oh, my gosh, I have to check in!' And so they do."
According to Dr. Mark, we also grab our phones because we need a break. Simply put, our brains aren't capable of focusing for long periods of time. Sustaining attention and resisting distractions uses up cognitive resources, and we need to replenish them periodically to regain focus. There's no equation to calculate the number of breaks you need per day, but Dr. Mark said that it's normal for focus to ebb and flow. "We can't be expected to hold sustained attention for a long period of time, in the same way a person can't lift weights all day," she said.
While a walk around the block or 10 minutes of meditation would likely be more rejuvenating, there's nothing inherently wrong with scrolling on social media or playing a repetitive game like Candy Crush to recharge. The problem arises when the breaks become longer or more frequent than you intended. This is where a timer and self-control come in.
Take a timed tech break.
To increase your attention span, Dr. Rosen recommended employing what he calls a "tech break." Before you have to focus on a task, take one or two minutes to open all your favorite apps. Then set a timer for 15 minutes, silence your phone, turn it face down and set it to the side. When the timer goes off, you get another one or two minutes to check your phone -- a tech break. Repeat this cycle three or four times before taking a longer break from your work. (Fans of the Pomodoro Technique will recognize this structure.)
The goal is to gradually increase the time between your tech breaks, building up to 20-, 30- and even 45-minute stretches. Dr. Rosen said you'll know you're ready to focus for longer periods when the timer goes off and you want to stay on task instead of reaching for your device.
Tech breaks aren't only for work settings; you can use them any time you want to be present in the moment. Dr. Rosen advised implementing them during dinner, particularly if you have frequent conflicts with teens over cellphone use at the table.
Another strategy Dr. Mark recommended is to increase your self-awareness about your technology use. When you have an urge to open Instagram, for example, ask yourself why: Do you feel exhausted and need a break? Will this help restore you? If so, go for it. After a few minutes, check in again and ask if the app is still giving you value. If not, it's time to get back to work.
Neither Dr. Mark nor Dr. Rosen are fans of trying to go cold turkey by declaring a phone-free day or using software to block certain websites. People inevitably return to their old habits when they have access again, and they don't improve their self control.
Try deep reading (on paper).
Tech breaks and self-awareness can help you control the urge to jump from screen to screen, but Maryanne Wolf, a professor-in-residence at the University of California, Los Angeles Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said that even when we're reading just one screen, we aren't engaging with it deeply. That's because screens are designed to make us read very quickly -- to scan, skim and scroll. As a result, we don't give the text our full attention and are more apt to miss information.
"The nature of a screen, if you just think about it, is to constantly refresh the information," Dr. Wolf said. "There is a psychological mind-set to go from the start to the finish as quickly as possible."
Traditionally, our brains tended to read print materials more slowly, in part because we were more likely to go back and double-check what we just read. That extra time lent itself to sophisticated mental processes like critical analysis, inference, deduction and empathy.
Unfortunately, simply printing out an article or opting for a paperback book instead of your Kindle won't guarantee that you suddenly become a more engaged reader. Our brains adapt to read in the style of the medium we use most often, and chances are you spend a lot more time reading on a screen than you do on paper. As a result, Dr. Wolf said, you likely now read in print the way you read on a screen.
"Many people have lost the ability to really immerse themselves," she said. "We have developed a cognitive impatience about our reading."
To get back in the practice of what Dr. Wolf calls "deep reading," try to dedicate at least 20 minutes a day to reading a physical book, combined with Dr. Mark and Dr. Rosen's tips to fight distraction. Start with something you want to read for pleasure, set an alarm for 20 minutes, put your phone on silent, and make yourself read slowly and deliberately. Don't get frustrated if you're not absorbed right away -- when Dr. Wolf tried this experiment on herself, it took her two weeks before she was able to fully engage with and enjoy what she was reading.
Even if you're not an avid reader, the exercise can help you regain the ability to focus deeply on what you're doing. "There's a lot of power in being able to feel that you can control your attention," Dr. Mark said. "You're in control of your behavior."

Soccer Venue to Cost Taxpayers $0. Or $516 Million.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An independent budget analysis suggests that the city will be losing $ 516 million in tax revenue from its deal to place a new soccer stadium in Queens.
New York City's first professional soccer stadium supposedly carries no financial burden to New York City taxpayers -- an assertion Mayor Eric Adams made repeatedly during a de facto victory tour this fall, after he announced the deal.
As it turns out, the truth is more complicated and far more costly to New Yorkers.
In a new analysis, the city's Independent Budget Office has concluded that the actual cost to taxpayers for the new soccer stadium in Queens will be at least $ 516 million, spread over the course of the 49-year term of the New York City Football Club's lease.
Government subsidies for sports stadiums have long been a third-rail issue in New York City. Economists who study the use of public money for sports teams argue that the public costs generally exceed the public benefits. Yet political leaders continue to pony up, often because they do not want to alienate sports fans.
Following a record-setting public subsidy deal for a new Buffalo Bills stadium last year -- including $ 850 million in direct construction subsidies -- Mayor Adams characterized his agreement with the New York City Football Club as a different animal. The soccer team would pay for the 25,000-seat stadium's $ 780 million construction cost without city money and without tax-exempt financing.
But there was a caveat.
Because the city chose to lease the land in the Willets Point neighborhood to the developers rather than sell it, no property taxes will be generated.
The Independent Budget Office's calculation was based on what the city would have received in property taxes had it sold the land to the stadium's developers. That figure -- $ 1.7 billion -- would be worth something more like $ 516 million today, when inflation and the uncertainty of the dollar's worth in 49 years are factored in.
"The claim that the city is not subsidizing the stadium doesn't really hold," said George Sweeting, the budget office's acting director.
A typical workaround for economic development deals on city land is to levy a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT for short. In this instance, the developers will pay a PILOT on the land where the subsidized housing is being built by the stadium, but only $ 1 a year in rent, city officials said. The developers will also pay both rent and PILOT payments on the planned hotel.
But no PILOT payments will be required for the land under the stadium -- it will only generate rent, which officials said would start at about $ 500,000 a year and escalate to $ 4 million by the end of the 49-year lease.
"Four million [dollars] in 49 years, that seems like a pretty low rent," said Nathan Jensen, a professor of government at the University of Texas-Austin who focuses on state and local economic development.
Mr. Adams set out to convey a different message: that the deal was unusual for sparing taxpayers any cost.
"The stadium that we're building -- that's going to produce a substantial number of jobs -- is 100 percent private funding," the mayor told WCBS 880, a message he and his team would repeat over and again that mid-November day. "We're not spending a dime of taxpayers' dollars."
Critics of the subsidy deal note the immense wealth of the soccer team, which is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the brother of the country's president, and the New York Yankees. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index recently estimated the Al Nahyan family has a net worth of at least $ 300 billion.
The stadium's other developers, a joint venture of Related Companies and Sterling Equities, are also not without substantial resources. Stephen M. Ross, the founder and chairman of Related Companies, is worth nearly $ 12 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Sterling Equities was co-founded by Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, who, with Jeff Wilpon sold the Mets to Steven A. Cohen, a hedge fund manager, for $ 2.4 billion in 2020.
Related Companies and Sterling Equities will sublease the stadium to the soccer team, a spokesman for the team said, but the terms of that economic agreement remain opaque.
"What you're doing in effect is redistributing income from the general taxpayer to the very wealthy," said Dennis Coates, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who focuses on sports economics.
Not only will the team's owners not have to pay property taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, but the city is also kicking in an estimated $ 200 million to $ 300 million in infrastructure improvements for the entire project in Willets Point, which used to be home to the city's largest collection of auto body repair and salvage shops before the city evicted them.
The Adams administration argues that this is an investment worth making.
"This analysis is based on the fabricated premise that a contaminated, languishing site divided among several property owners could be set aside for some mysterious theoretical use while generating the property tax revenue of a project that will create $ 6 billion in economic activity, 14,000 construction jobs, and 2,500 affordable homes," said Charles Lutvak, a spokesman for the mayor.
"To be clear, that scenario is entirely implausible, and Mayor Adams's vision for Willets Point -- which includes one of the most fiscally responsible stadium deals in recent history -- will deliver substantial benefits while bringing in up to $ 4 million a year in rent for the city and critical infrastructure and resources to the entire Willets Point community."
The plan has its supporters.
James Patchett, the former president of the Economic Development Corporation who now works in real estate, noted that the Willets Point land has been contaminated by decades of use as a home for auto body shops, and he argued that the development options there were limited without some form of government subsidy.
"The notion that there is a real revenue generating, taxpaying use to be built at this site apart from a casino is just not realistic," Mr. Patchett said. "It's unusual also to see a stadium deal that is not being financed with tax-exempt bonds, which I think is something that is certainly in favor of this deal."
A spokesman for the soccer team said the stadium would "bring record affordable housing, billions in economic activity, a public school and thousands of jobs to Queens."
The city and state helped the Mets and Yankees build their current stadiums on city land, including via the use of tax-exempt bonds. In 2009, the Independent Budget Office calculated the value of city and state subsidies for both stadiums at a cumulative $ 762.3 million.
While the Bills secured nearly $ 1 billion in construction subsidies from the state and Erie County for their stadium project, New York and other major cities like Oakland and Los Angeles have pushed back against wealthy sports teams in recent years.
"It seems that periodically there is a short-term blip where people recognize that this isn't such a great use of tax dollars," Professor Coates said.
In 2005, the Jets' attempt to build a stadium on public land on the West Side of Manhattan with the backing of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ran into stiff opposition from James Dolan, the owner of the Knicks and Rangers. Lawmakers in Albany ultimately shot down the proposal.
Mr. Dolan, who also owns Madison Square Garden, has his own subsidies in the form of city property tax exemptions, passed by the state in 1982, that are now worth an estimated $ 43 million a year. Politicians have been trying to overturn the exemption for years.
"It's a 100 percent, 49-year subsidy; I mean, that's big, that's Amazon HQ 2 level subsidy," said Professor Jensen, referring to the multicity competition to host Amazon's second headquarters, which involved offers of substantial government subsidies. "A lot of communities didn't even offer that large for thousands of jobs."

On the morning of the day I had decided to go without using plastic products -- or even touching plastic -- I opened my eyes and put my bare feet on the carpet. Which is made of nylon, a type of plastic. I was roughly 10 seconds into my experiment, and I had already committed a violation.
Since its invention more than a century ago, plastic has crept into every aspect of our lives. It's hard to go even a few minutes without touching this durable, lightweight, wildly versatile substance. Plastic has made possible thousands of modern conveniences, but it has come with downsides, especially for the environment. Last week, in a 24-hour experiment, I tried to live without it altogether in an effort to see what plastic stuff we can't do without and what we may be able to give up.
Most mornings I check my iPhone soon after waking up. On the appointed day, this was not possible, given that, in addition to aluminum, iron, lithium, gold and copper, each iPhone contains plastic. In preparation for the experiment, I had stashed my device in a closet. I quickly found that not having access to it left me feeling disoriented and bold, as if I were some sort of intrepid time traveler.
I made my way toward the bathroom, only to stop myself before I went in.
"Could you open the door for me?" I asked my wife, Julie. "The doorknob has a plastic coating."
She opened it for me, letting out a "this is going to be a long day" sigh.
My morning hygiene routine needed a total revamp, which required detailed preparations in the days before my experiment. I could not use my regular toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo or liquid soap, all of which were encased in plastic or made of plastic.
Fortunately, there is a huge industry of plastic-free products targeted at eco-conscious consumers, and I had bought an array of them, a haul that included a bamboo toothbrush with bristles made of wild boar hair from Life Without Plastic. "The bristles are completely sterilized," Jay Sinha, the company's co-owner, assured me when I spoke with him the week before.
Instead of toothpaste, I had a jar of gray charcoal-mint toothpaste pellets. I popped one in, chewed it, sipped water and brushed. It was nice and minty, though the ash-colored spit was unsettling.
I liked my shampoo bar. A shampoo bar is just what it sounds like: a bar of shampoo. Mine was scented pink grapefruit and vanilla, and lathered up well. According to shampoo bar advocates, it is also cheaper than bottled shampoo on a per-wash basis (one bar can last 80 showers). Which is good, because the plastic-free life can be expensive. Package Free, a sleek outlet in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan that abuts Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop store, sells a zinc and stainless-steel razor for $ 84 (as well as "the world's first biodegradable vibrator").
Taking a blogger's advice, I mixed a D.I.Y. deodorant out of tea tree oil and baking soda. It left me smelling a little like a medieval cathedral, but in a good way. Making your own stuff is another way to avoid plastic, though it does require another luxury: free time.
Before I was done in the bathroom, I had broken the rules a second time, by using the toilet.
Getting dressed was also a challenge, given that so many clothing items include plastic. I had ordered a pair of wool pants that promised to be plastic free, but they had not arrived. In their stead, I chose a pair of old Banana Republic chinos.
The tag said "100 percent cotton," but when I had checked the day before with a very helpful Banana Republic public relations representative, it turned out to be a little more complicated. The main fabric is indeed 100 percent cotton, but there was plastic lurking in the zipper tape, the internal waistband, woven label, pocketing and threads, the representative told me. I cut my thumb trying to slice off the black brand label with an all-metal knife. Instead of a Band-Aid -- yes, plastic -- I used some gummed paper tape to stop the bleeding.
Happily, my underwear did not represent a plastic violation -- blue boxers from Cottonique made of 100 percent organic cotton with a cotton drawstring in place of the elastic (which is often plastic) waistband. I had found this item via an internet list of "14 Hot & Sustainable Underwear Brands for Men."
For my upper body, I lucked out. Our friend Kristen had knitted my wife a sweater for a birthday present. It had rectangles of blue and purple, and it was 100 percent merino wool.
"Could I borrow Kristen's sweater for the day?" I asked Julie.
"You're going to stretch it out," Julie said.
"It's for planet Earth," I reminded her.
Plastics Present and Past
The world produces about 400 million metric tons of plastic waste each year, according to a United Nations report. About half is tossed out after a single use. The report noted that "we have become addicted to single-use plastic products -- with severe environmental, social, economic and health consequences."
I'm one of the addicts. I did an audit, and I'd estimate that I toss about 800 plastic items in the garbage a year -- takeout containers, pens, cups, Amazon packages with foam inside and more.
Before my Day of No Plastic, I immersed myself in a number of no-plastic and zero-waste books, videos and podcasts. One of the books, "Life Without Plastic: The Practical Step-by-Step Guide to Avoiding Plastic to Keep Your Family and the Planet Healthy," by Mr. Sinha and Chantal Plamondon, came from Amazon wrapped in clear plastic, like a slice of American cheese. When I mentioned this to Mr. Sinha, he promised to look into it.
I also called Gabby Salazar, a social scientist who studies what motivates people to support environmental causes, and asked for her advice as I headed into my plastic-free day.
"It might be better to start small," Dr. Salazar said. "Start by creating a single habit -- like always carrying a stainless-steel water bottle. After you've got that down, you start another habit, like taking produce bags to the grocery. You build up gradually. That's how you make real change. Otherwise, you'll just be overwhelmed."
"Maybe being overwhelmed will bring some sort of clarity?" I said.
"That'd be nice," Dr. Salazar said.
Admittedly, living completely without plastic is probably an absurd idea. Despite its faults, plastic is a crucial ingredient in medical equipment, smoke alarms and helmets. There's truth to the plastics industry's catchphrase from the 1990s: "Plastics make it possible."
In many cases it can help the environment: Plastic airplane parts are lighter than metal ones, which mean less fuel and lower CO₂ emissions. Solar panels and wind turbines have plastic parts. That said, the world is overloaded with the stuff, especially the disposable forms. The Earth Policy Institute estimates that people go through one trillion single-use plastic bags each year.
The crisis was a long time coming. There's some debate over when plastic entered the world, but many date it to 1855, when a British metallurgist, Alexander Parkes, patented a thermoplastic material as a waterproof coating for fabrics. He called the substance "Parkesine." Over the decades, labs across the world birthed other types, all with a similar chemistry: They are polymer chains, and most are made from petroleum or natural gas. Thanks to chemical additives, plastics vary wildly. They can be opaque or transparent, foamy or hard, stretchy or brittle. They are known by many names, including polyester and Styrofoam, and by shorthand like PVC and PET.
Plastic manufacturing ramped up for World War II and was crucial to the war effort, providing nylon parachutes and Plexiglas aircraft windows. That was followed by a postwar boom, said Susan Freinkel, the author of "Plastic: A Toxic Love Story," a book on the history and science of plastic. "Plastic went into things like Formica counters, refrigerator liners, car parts, clothing, shoes, just all sorts of stuff that was designed to be used for a while," she said.
Then things took a turn.
"Where we really started to get into trouble is when it started going into single-use stuff," Ms. Freinkel said. "I call it prefab litter."
The outpouring of straws, cups, bags and other ephemera has led to disastrous consequences for the environment. According to a study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than 11 million metric tons of plastic enter oceans each year, leaching into the water, disrupting the food chain and choking marine life.
Close to one-fifth of plastic waste gets burned, releasing CO2 into the air, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports that only 9 percent of plastics are recycled. Some aren't economical to recycle, and other types degrade in quality when they are.
Plastic may also harm our health. Certain plastic additives -- such as BPA and phthalates -- may disrupt the endocrine system in humans, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Worrying effects may include behavioral problems and lower testosterone levels in boys and lower thyroid hormone levels and preterm births for women.
"Solving this plastic problem can't fall entirely on the shoulders of consumers," Dr. Salazar told me. "We need to work on it on all fronts."
It's Everywhere
Early in my no-plastic day, I started to see the world differently. Everything looked menacing, like it might be harboring hidden polymers. The kitchen was particularly fraught. Anything I could use for cooking was off-limits -- the toaster, the oven, the microwave. Even leftovers were a no-go. My son waved a plastic baggie filled with French toast. "You want some of this?" Yes, I did.
Instead, I decided to go foraging for raw food items.
I left my building using the stairs, rather than the elevator with its plastic buttons, and walked to a health food store near our apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
When I go shopping, I try to remember to take a cloth bag with me. This time, I had brought along seven bags of varying sizes, all of them cotton. I also had two glass containers.
At the store, I filled up one of my cotton bags with apples and oranges. On close inspection, I noticed that the each rind had a sticker with a code. Another likely violation, but I ignored it.
At the bulk bins, I scooped walnuts and oatmeal into my glass dishes using a (washed) steel ladle I had brought from home. The bins themselves were plastic, which I ignored, because I was hungry.
I went to the cashier. At which point it was time to pay. Which was a problem. Credit cards were out. So was my iPhone's Apple Pay. Paper money was another violation: Although U.S. paper currency is made mainly of cotton and linen, each bill likely contains synthetic fibers, and the higher denominations have a security thread made of plastic to prevent counterfeiting.
To be safe, I had brought along a cotton sack full of coins. Yes, a big old sack heavy with quarters, dimes and pennies -- about $ 60 worth that I had withdrawn from Citibank and my kids' piggy banks.
At the checkout counter, I started stacking quarters as quickly as I could between nervous glances at the customers behind me.
"I'm really sorry this is taking so long," I said.
"That's OK," the cashier said. "I meditate every morning so I can deal with turmoil like this."
He added that he appreciated my commitment to the environment. It was the first positive feedback I'd received. I counted out $ 19.02 -- exact change! -- and went home to eat my breakfast: nuts and oranges on a metal cookie tray, which I balanced on my lap.
A couple of hours later, in search of a plastic-free lunch, I walked to Lenwich, a sandwich and salad shop in my neighborhood. I arrived early in the afternoon, toting my rectangular glass dish and bamboo cutlery.
"Can you make the salad in this glass container?" I asked, holding it up.
"One minute please," the man behind the counter said, tersely.
He called over a manager, who said OK. Victory! But the manager then rejected my follow-up request to use my steel scooper.
After lunch, I headed to Central Park, figuring that this was a spot in Manhattan where I could relax in a plastic-free environment. I took the subway there, which scored me more violations, since the trains themselves have plastic parts and you need a MetroCard or smartphone to get through the turnstiles.
At least I didn't sit in one of those plastic orange seats. I had brought my own: an unpainted, fold-up Nordic-style teak chair, hard and austere. It's what I had been using at the apartment to avoid the plastic-tainted chairs and couches.
I plopped my chair down near a pole in the middle of the car. One guy had a please-don't-talk-to-me look in his eyes, but the other passengers were so buried in their phones that the sight of a man on a wooden chair didn't faze them.
Walking through Central Park, I spotted dental floss picks, a black plastic knife and a plastic bag.
Back home, I recorded some of my impressions. I wrote on paper with an unpainted cedar pencil from a "Zero Waste Pencil tin set" (regular pencils contain plastic-filled yellow paint). After a while, I went to get a drink of water. Which brings up perhaps the most pervasive foe of all, one I haven't even mentioned yet: microplastics. These tiny particles are everywhere -- in the water we drink, the air we breathe, in the oceans. They come from, among other things, degraded plastic litter.
Are they harmful to us? I talked with several scientists, and the general answer I got was: We don't know yet. "I think we'll have an improved understanding in the next few years," said Todd Gouin, an environmental research consultant. But those who are extra-cautious can use products that promise to filter microplastics from water and air.
I had bought a pitcher by LifeStraw that contains a membrane microfilter. Of course, the pitcher itself had plastic parts, so I couldn't use it on the Big Day. Instead, the night before, I spent some time at the sink filtering water and filling up Mason jars. Our kitchen looked like it was ready for the apocalypse.
The water tasted particularly pure, which I'm guessing was some sort of a placebo effect.
I wrote for a while. Then I sat there in my wooden chair. Phone-less. Internet-less. Julie took some pity on me and offered to play a game of cards. I shook my head.
"Plastic coating," I said.
At about 9 p.m., I took our dog for her nightly walk. I was using a 100 percent cotton leash I bought online. I had ditched the poop bags -- even the sustainable ones I found were made with recycled or plant-based plastic. Instead, I carried a metal spatula. Thankfully, I didn't have to use it.
At 10:30 p.m., exhausted, I lay down on my makeshift bed -- cotton sheets on the wood floor, since my mattress and pillows are plasticky.
I woke up the next morning glad to have survived my ordeal and be reunited with my phone -- but also with a feeling of defeat.
I had made 164 violations, by my count. As Dr. Salazar had predicted, I felt overwhelmed. And also uncertain. There was so much that remained unclear, even after I had been studying this topic for weeks. What plastic-free items really made a difference, and what is mere green-washing? Is it a good idea to use boar's-hair toothbrushes, tea tree deodorant, microplastic-filtering devices and paper straws, or does the trouble of using those things make everyone so bonkers that they actually end up damaging the cause?
I called Dr. Salazar for a pep talk.
"You can drive yourself crazy," she said. "But it's not about perfection, it's about progress. Believe it or not, individual behavior does matter. It adds up.
"Remember," she continued, "it's not about plastic being the enemy. It's about single-use as the enemy. It's the culture of using something once and throwing it away."
I thought back to something that the author Susan Freinkel had told me: "I'm not an absolutist at all. If you came into my kitchen, you would be like, what the hell? You wrote this book and look at how you live!"
Ms. Freinkel does make an effort, she said. She avoids single-use bags, cups and packaging, among other things. I pledge to try, too, even after my not wholly successful attempt at a one-day ban.
I'll start with small things, building up habits. I liked the shampoo bar. And I can take produce bags to the grocery. I might even pack my steel water bottle and bamboo cutlery for my trips to Lenwich. And from there, who knows?
And I'll proudly wear the "Keep the Sea Plastic Free" T-shirt that I bought online in the days leading up to the experiment. It's just 10 percent polyester.

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 8-14)
System Breakdown
On the heels of Southwest Airlines' holiday travel meltdown, a much wider systemic breakdown grounded planes last week. The source of the problem lay with the Federal Aviation Administration, whose system alerting pilots to safety issues went down on Wednesday. In total, the disruption caused more than 9,000 delays and 1,300 cancellations, leaving many passengers stranded with no airline to blame. The cause was a damaged database file, according to the agency, and the White House said there was no evidence of a cyberattack. But the system failure is nonetheless unsettling, revealing the fragility of the infrastructure that the country relies on to manage commercial air traffic. Critics say the F.A.A. has struggled to keep up with technological advances as well as the rise in the number of flights and passengers. The air travel chaos again put Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the agency, in the hot seat. He said he was trying to determine "how this could have happened in the first place."
Inflation Cools Down
To the relief of American households and policymakers in Washington, consumer prices -- climbing at a blistering pace not so long ago -- are continuing to cool down. Inflation is slowing on an annual basis, according to the latest numbers, with the Consumer Price Index rising 6.5 percent over the year through December, down from 7.1 percent in November. That drop was largely due to falling prices for gas and plane tickets. A pullback in inflation of the prices of goods and moderating rent costs this year could help ease overall inflation. The report should be encouraging for central bankers at the Federal Reserve, who are beginning to see clearer signs that their campaign to tame rising prices is having the desired effect -- which is why they are considering raising interest rates a quarter point at their February meeting rather than carrying out another half- or three-quarter-point increase.
Pink Slips at Goldman Sachs
Last week, Goldman Sachs began one of its largest rounds of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank plans to cut 3,200 jobs in total, or about 6 percent of its work force, as it struggles with a downturn in deal-making and sagging markets. And on Friday it disclosed that its effort to expand into consumer banking had resulted in $ 3 billion in losses since 2020. It is far from the only Wall Street giant experiencing these challenges: JPMorgan Chase, the country's largest bank, reported that its investment banking revenue in the fourth quarter fell 57 percent and said it had set aside $ 1 billion to prepare for the possibility of a "mild recession." Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have also each earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars to account for future loan losses. Goldman's earnings, which will be released this week, are likely to closely mirror those of its peers.
What's Next? (Jan. 15-21)
Elon Musk's Trial Over a Tweet
Even before Elon Musk took over Twitter, he was not known for his discretion on the platform. This week, Mr. Musk is scheduled to go to trial over a tweet he posted in August 2018, telling his millions of followers: "Am considering taking Tesla private at $ 420. Funding secured." With that declaration -- suggesting a more than $ 70 billion deal -- he sent the electric vehicle company's stock soaring and ended up with $ 40 million in fines from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders have sought their own recourse, too, filing a lawsuit seeking damages and accusing Mr. Musk and other current and former Tesla board members of stock manipulation. Mr. Musk has said the tweet referred to a potential investment from Saudi Arabia's government investment fund, but some familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund cast doubt on those claims, and board members at Tesla were blindsided by Mr. Musk's tweet.
Elites Head to Davos
The World Economic Forum will reconvene this week in Davos, Switzerland, for its first winter meeting since before the pandemic. The meeting, which brings together economists, business leaders and politicians, is poised to touch on issues like the war in Ukraine, rising energy and food prices around the world, and the potential of a global recession -- what the forum's president, Borge Brende, described as the "most complex political and economic backdrop in decades." Several Biden administration officials are expected to attend, including Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh and John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, but President Biden himself will not attend.
Bed Bath & Beyond, in Parts
Bed Bath & Beyond, which warned of rapidly darkening prospects this month, is in talks with the private equity firm Sycamore Partner about selling pieces of its business as part of a potential bankruptcy process. One possibility is that the home goods retailer would sell off its Buy Buy Baby stores, which face their own headwinds but have not fallen as sharply as their parent company. The retailer is also in talks with other suitors about potential deals, and a spokeswoman for Bed Bath & Beyond said multiple paths "are being explored." Bed Bath & Beyond has tried to turn around its business many times, most recently taking out more than $ 500 million in new financing in August to buy itself a lifeline.
What Else?
The U.S. deficit fell to $ 1.4 trillion in the 2022 calendar year, down from $ 2.6 trillion a year earlier. Amazon lost its bid to overturn the union victory at its Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, struck a hopeful note during a media briefing last week, saying a worldwide recession can be averted if China continues to ease its "zero Covid" policies and Russia's war in Ukraine does not worsen.

The Romance Novelist Who Faked Her Own Death: [Op-Ed]

Author: Greenwell, Megan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There are many ways to make yourself Twitter's main character for a day, but faking your death might be the most reliable. As remote-work types struggled to awake from their holiday season hibernation last week, we were jolted by a particularly juicy tidbit: Susan Meachen, a prolific self-published romance novelist whose suicide -- ostensibly a reaction to low book sales and bullying by fellow authors -- had been announced two years ago, returned to the internet, very much alive. "Let the fun begin," she concluded a social media post announcing her resurrection.
The fun did begin, though on a much larger scale than she likely expected. She had announced her return to the 700 or so fans and fellow writers who still followed her Facebook page, but the news spread fast. Within a day, millions more had read about her; BookTok was overtaken with videos of creators recapping the events or setting their disbelief to song. Suddenly, scores of people who, like me, didn't know the difference between an H.E.A. and an H.F.N. ending -- "happily ever after" versus "happy for now" -- were immersing themselves in the internal drama of a tiny group of indie romance writers.
Few topics are less funny than suicide, and Ms. Meachen caused genuine pain to people who cared about her. There's also a question of actual fraud, since her "relatives" allegedly crowdsourced money for her "funeral." But the deeper reporters and amateur sleuths dived down the rabbit hole, the more bizarre -- and, yes, amusing -- the details. She appears to have created a fake account to resume running her Facebook group, The Ward, after her purported death. She or a relative convinced other writers to edit her "last" book for free in time to present it as a posthumous wedding present to Ms. Meachen's daughter.
Her novels, with their stock cover images and generic titles like "Stolen Moments" and "My Crush," are filled with "dark secrets" and untimely deaths. On multiple occasions over the two years Ms. Meachen was believed to be dead, her "daughter" or "assistant" threatened to remove her books from Amazon because not enough people were buying them. One post from Ms. Meachen's Facebook account, written from the perspective of her daughter, included the sentence "Dead people don't post on social media." If none of this makes you giggle, you're a stronger person than I am.
The story seemed to strike a particular chord with those in and around the more established -- and more prestigious -- corners of the publishing industry. "While Meachen and the other writers who befriended her virtually refer to their community as 'the book world,' what they're talking about has little to do," wrote the book critic Laura Miller in Slate, a trace of condescension creeping in, with "the mainstream publishing industry, the professionals who work in it, and the authors whose books fill your local bookstore." Rather, she said, "Meachen's 'book world' is the community of self-published romance and erotica writers who sell low-cost e-books and print-on-demand paperbacks."
All the talk of the book world -- and how Ms. Meachen's death had, as a former friend said, ripped it "in half" -- did seem a bit overblown. But it also doesn't seem quite accurate to argue that the rarefied realm of Manhattan-based Big Five publishers is any more "real" than the comparatively lowbrow one of self-published romances.
The vast majority of books are self-published. For Ms. Meachen, the choice to go that route may not have been much of a choice at all: Her creative use of capitalization and punctuation would have made her an unlikely prospect for Knopf. But there are plenty of very talented Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, queer, disabled or trans authors who have looked at the industry's long record of discrimination and concluded that self publishing was the only outlet open to them. Colleen Hoover, currently the most popular author in the world by a massive margin, attracted publishing houses' attention only after her self-published novels became best-sellers. And the "legitimate" book world has had plenty of its own dumb drama in the past few years, from a 2019 Naomi Wolf book that was yanked from shelves because a central element of the historical research was wrong to a 2021 scandal in which a memoirist called people out for rating her book a mere four out of five stars on Goodreads and then compared the resulting outrage to "rape culture."
For people in mainstream book publishing, the Meachen saga may also have provided a welcome distraction from their own problems. After a healthy bump in sales during the pandemic, disappointing 2022 numbers combined with a looming recession have led to hiring slowdowns and layoffs. The Justice Department and a federal judge blocked Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster on antitrust grounds, so now Simon & Schuster may well be acquired by a private equity firm, which rarely bodes well for creative-class companies. At HarperCollins -- where I am under contract for my first book -- about 250 New York-based unionized employees have been on strike for two months. The core issue is that the union wants to raise entry-level salaries by $ 5,000, to $ 50,000. The increase would cost HarperCollins, whose annual revenue is over $ 2 billion, less than $ 1 million a year; editors have told heart-wrenching stories about being unable to afford rent and food, taking on second jobs, leaving the industry altogether because, in one of the world's most expensive cities, $ 45,000 is not enough to live on.
Yet the union says the company's senior leaders have informed members that they will not return to the bargaining table. In the meantime, HarperCollins has begun hiring scab workers. The publishing industry's work force remains far, far whiter than it should be, which has obvious ramifications for what books we get to read, yet executives seem to have no interest in making the industry more accessible to brilliant young minds who don't come from generational wealth.
On the surface, a HarperCollins editor striking in front of a Financial District skyscraper might seem to operate on another planet from a hobbyist writer posting from the grave begging people to kick in a couple of bucks for a romance novel. But what haunts me about the Meachen story is the kernel of universality behind her desperation for book world legitimacy. What author, self-published or traditional, can't relate to indulging in a little self-pity when her sales aren't where she hoped? What industry hasn't seen bullying allegations and its share of unstable characters? Who in the book world writ large doesn't feel she's fighting for crumbs? As in any good romance novel, the drama in the Meachen scandal was dialed up far past the point of relatability, but the feelings behind the drama were familiar to us all.

Soccer Venue to Cost Taxpayers $0. Or $516 Million.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — New York City’s first professional soccer stadium supposedly carries no financial burden to city taxpayers — an assertion Mayor Eric Adams made repeatedly during a de facto victory tour this past fall after he announced the deal.
As it turns out, the truth is more complicated and far more costly to New Yorkers.
In a new analysis, the city’s Independent Budget Office has concluded that the actual cost to taxpayers for the new soccer stadium in Queens will be at least $516 million, spread over the course of the 49-year term of the New York City Football Club’s lease.
Government subsidies for sports stadiums have long been a third-rail issue in New York City. Economists who study the use of public money for sports teams argue that the public costs generally exceed the public benefits. Yet political leaders continue to pony up, often because they do not want to alienate sports fans.
After a record-setting public subsidy deal for a new Buffalo Bills stadium last year — including $850 million in direct construction subsidies — Adams characterized his agreement with the New York City Football Club as a different animal. The soccer team would pay for the 25,000-seat stadium’s $780 million construction cost without city money and without tax-exempt financing.
But there was a caveat.
Because the city chose to lease the land in the Willets Point neighborhood to the developers rather than sell it, no property taxes will be generated.
The Independent Budget Office’s calculation was based on what the city would have received in property taxes had it sold the land to the stadium’s developers. That figure — $1.7 billion — would be worth something more like $516 million today, when inflation and the uncertainty of the dollar’s worth in 49 years are factored in.
“The claim that the city is not subsidizing the stadium doesn’t really hold,” said George Sweeting, the budget office’s acting director.
A typical workaround for economic development deals on city land is to levy a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT. In this instance, the developers will pay a PILOT on the land where the subsidized housing is being built by the stadium, but only $1 a year in rent, city officials said. The developers will also pay both rent and PILOT payments on the planned hotel.
But no PILOT payments will be required for the land under the stadium; it will only generate rent, which officials said would start at about $500,000 a year and escalate to $4 million by the end of the 49-year lease.
“Four million [dollars] in 49 years — that seems like a pretty low rent,” said Nathan Jensen, a professor of government at the University of Texas-Austin who focuses on state and local economic development.
Adams set out to convey a different message: that the deal was unusual for sparing taxpayers any cost.
“The stadium that we’re building — that’s going to produce a substantial number of jobs — is 100% private funding,” he told WCBS 880, a message he and his team would repeat over and again that mid-November day. “We’re not spending a dime of taxpayers’ dollars.”
Critics of the subsidy deal note the immense wealth of the soccer team, which is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan — deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the brother of the country’s president — and the New York Yankees. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index recently estimated the Al Nahyan family has a net worth of at least $300 billion.
The stadium’s other developers, a joint venture of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, are also not without substantial resources. Stephen Ross, founder and chair of Related Cos., is worth nearly $12 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Sterling Equities was co-founded by Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, who, with Jeff Wilpon, sold the New York Mets to Steven Cohen, a hedge fund manager, for $2.4 billion in 2020.
Related Cos. and Sterling Equities will sublease the stadium to the soccer team, a spokesperson for the team said, but the terms of that economic agreement remain opaque.
“What you’re doing, in effect, is redistributing income from the general taxpayer to the very wealthy,” said Dennis Coates, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who focuses on sports economics.
Not only will the team’s owners not have to pay property taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, but the city is also kicking in an estimated $200 million to $300 million in infrastructure improvements for the entire project in Willets Point, which used to be home to the city’s largest collection of auto body repair and salvage shops before the city evicted them.
The Adams administration argues that this is an investment worth making.
“This analysis is based on the fabricated premise that a contaminated, languishing site divided among several property owners could be set aside for some mysterious theoretical use while generating the property tax revenue of a project that will create $6 billion in economic activity, 14,000 construction jobs and 2,500 affordable homes,” said Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the mayor. “To be clear, that scenario is entirely implausible, and Mayor Adams’ vision for Willets Point — which includes one of the most fiscally responsible stadium deals in recent history — will deliver substantial benefits while bringing in up to $4 million a year in rent for the city and critical infrastructure and resources to the entire Willets Point community.”
The plan has its supporters.
James Patchett, a former president of the Economic Development Corp. who now works in real estate, noted that the Willets Point land has been contaminated by decades of use as a home for auto body shops, and he argued that the development options there were limited without some form of government subsidy.
“The notion that there is a real revenue-generating, taxpaying use to be built at this site apart from a casino is just not realistic,” Patchett said. “It’s unusual also to see a stadium deal that is not being financed with tax-exempt bonds, which I think is something that is certainly in favor of this deal.”
A spokesperson for the soccer team said the stadium would “bring record affordable housing, billions in economic activity, a public school and thousands of jobs to Queens.”
The city and state helped the Mets and Yankees build their current stadiums on city land, including via the use of tax-exempt bonds. In 2009, the Independent Budget Office calculated the value of city and state subsidies for both stadiums at a cumulative $762.3 million.
Although the Bills secured nearly $1 billion in construction subsidies from the state and Erie County for their stadium project, New York and other major cities such as Oakland, California, and Los Angeles have pushed back against wealthy sports teams in recent years.
“It seems that periodically, there is a short-term blip where people recognize that this isn’t such a great use of tax dollars,” Coates said.
In 2005, the Jets’ attempt to build a stadium on public land on the west side of Manhattan with the backing of Mayor Michael Bloomberg ran into stiff opposition from James Dolan, owner of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. Lawmakers in Albany, the state’s capital, ultimately shot down the proposal.
Dolan, who also owns Madison Square Garden, has his own subsidies in the form of city property tax exemptions, passed by the state in 1982, that are now worth an estimated $43 million a year. Politicians have been trying to overturn the exemption for years.
“It’s a 100%, 49-year subsidy. I mean, that’s big. That’s Amazon HQ 2-level subsidy,” said Jensen, referring to the multicity competition to host Amazon’s second headquarters, which involved offers of substantial government subsidies. “A lot of communities didn’t even offer that large for thousands of jobs.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Smirk, a Smile, a Clenched Fist: What the Movies Taught Me to See: [Op-Ed]

Full text: I was seduced by Cate Blanchett in "Tár." The 1980s ecological disaster in "White Noise" felt eerily familiar to me in our time of climate change. I was struck by how dark Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" was compared with the Disney animated version I saw as a child in South Jersey in the early 1960s.
As I do every year, I'll tune in to the Golden Globes tonight and the Oscars in March. I'll be curious to find out if my picks will win best picture or other awards.
Many people enjoy movies. But people are often surprised that I do, too, because I am legally blind. I don't watch a film the way a sighted person does, but the experience opens up a whole world for me.
Like many other people who are legally blind, as I have been my whole life, I do have some vision. I see colors, I see motion, and I see faces, though I may not recognize whose faces they are unless they are very near. I can write on my iPad and computer and read on my Kindle if I enlarge the font enough. I can watch movies or TV if I'm close to the screen.
I owe my movie-maven status to my mom and dad, now deceased. They loved me. They hadn't met any blind or low-vision people before I was born, and maybe because of that, they never set rigid boundaries on what I should or shouldn't do. "We wanted you to do and enjoy as much as possible what the other kids did," my mother told me. And so the movies.
Yearly, my folks took me to see an ophthalmologist. He was a kind man who saw the whole me, not just a pair of bad eyes. "Her vision will always be impaired," he said to my folks, "but Kathi's still learning to use the vision she has."
Watching movies, the good doctor advised, would encourage me to take in images. To look at people's faces and gestures. To notice what landscapes, houses and other spaces and places look like.
My parents, film buffs, needed no encouragement to expose me to the silver screen. In my small town, every Saturday afternoon, kids lined up to go to the matinee at the local movie theater. Quarter in hand, I went with my pals to see the latest picture along with the trailers and cartoons that preceded it.
My grandmother would tell me to smile when she took my picture, but I had no idea what a smile looked like. I didn't know what my dad was talking about when he'd tell me not to curl my lip. I was later thrilled to discover what smiling and dancing looked like when I saw Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews in "Mary Poppins." I shivered as I looked into the deliciously evil eyes of Cruella de Vil in "101 Dalmatians."
At the movies, for the first time, close to the giant silver screen, I could see clenched fists, grimaces, smiles, nods and other expressions and gestures. Back in the day, I would have had no idea of what a life hack was. But that's what movies have been for me.
In real life, I frequently have trouble reading the room because I rarely see facial expressions, gestures or what people are wearing unless I'm very close to them. I frequently miss visual information that gives sighted people clues about the people they date, fall in love with, marry, parent, socialize with and work with. I can't see how you gesture to get a server's attention when you're having dinner out or when you're flirting with me or rolling your eyes.
I won't pretend that I see what sighted people see when they view movies, but I see enough. I also sometimes use audio description, a form of narration that gives blind and low-vision people access to visual elements in movies and other media.
Yes, a lot of the time I can't tell what weapon is used in a murder mystery or the size of the engagement ring a lover has hidden in his beloved's dessert. But the sheer experience of film is what I love -- the sense of images moving across the screen as we move through space and time. And because movies are on a big screen, with close-ups of lovers, musical numbers, battles and street scenes, I'm able to view what I otherwise rarely can.
My everyday life, like that of everyone I've ever known, isn't like the movies. I'm not, like Norma Desmond, getting ready for my close-up. I've had some lovely romances but never as magical as in "The Philadelphia Story." I have moments of existential dread. But I'm not Laurence Olivier in "Hamlet."
Yet the imaginary world of the movies has helped me by giving me irreplaceable, even magical glimpses into how the world works. From watching films, I got my first idea of what people were talking about when they said someone was smirking, snarling or shrugging. Today I'm not bewildered if I'm asked to smile for a photo. One day, I'll learn how to roll my eyes.
Movies have been a decoder ring that helped me make sense of the world. They've taught me to go beyond -- to picture beyond the rainbow and wild moonlight and even to take pride in how I see them in ways not everyone does. A blur, the need to get really close, to pay exquisite attention can be beautiful.

Will New York City’s Soccer Stadium Cost Taxpayers $0 or $516 Million?

NEW YORK — New York City’s first professional soccer stadium supposedly carries no financial burden to city taxpayers — an assertion Mayor Eric Adams made repeatedly during a de facto victory tour this past fall after he announced the deal.
As it turns out, the truth is more complicated and far more costly to New Yorkers.
In a new analysis, the city’s Independent Budget Office has concluded that the actual cost to taxpayers for the new soccer stadium in Queens will be at least $516 million, spread over the course of the 49-year term of the New York City Football Club’s lease.
Government subsidies for sports stadiums have long been a third-rail issue in New York City. Economists who study the use of public money for sports teams argue that the public costs generally exceed the public benefits. Yet political leaders continue to pony up, often because they do not want to alienate sports fans.
After a record-setting public subsidy deal for a new Buffalo Bills stadium last year — including $850 million in direct construction subsidies — Adams characterized his agreement with the New York City Football Club as a different animal. The soccer team would pay for the 25,000-seat stadium’s $780 million construction cost without city money and without tax-exempt financing.
But there was a caveat.
Because the city chose to lease the land in the Willets Point neighborhood to the developers rather than sell it, no property taxes will be generated.
The Independent Budget Office’s calculation was based on what the city would have received in property taxes had it sold the land to the stadium’s developers. That figure — $1.7 billion — would be worth something more like $516 million today, when inflation and the uncertainty of the dollar’s worth in 49 years are factored in.
“The claim that the city is not subsidizing the stadium doesn’t really hold,” said George Sweeting, the budget office’s acting director.
A typical workaround for economic development deals on city land is to levy a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT. In this instance, the developers will pay a PILOT on the land where the subsidized housing is being built by the stadium, but only $1 a year in rent, city officials said. The developers will also pay both rent and PILOT payments on the planned hotel.
But no PILOT payments will be required for the land under the stadium; it will only generate rent, which officials said would start at about $500,000 a year and escalate to $4 million by the end of the 49-year lease.
“Four million [dollars] in 49 years — that seems like a pretty low rent,” said Nathan Jensen, a professor of government at the University of Texas-Austin who focuses on state and local economic development.
Adams set out to convey a different message: that the deal was unusual for sparing taxpayers any cost.
“The stadium that we’re building — that’s going to produce a substantial number of jobs — is 100% private funding,” he told WCBS 880, a message he and his team would repeat over and again that mid-November day. “We’re not spending a dime of taxpayers’ dollars.”
Critics of the subsidy deal note the immense wealth of the soccer team, which is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan — deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the brother of the country’s president — and the New York Yankees. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index recently estimated the Al Nahyan family has a net worth of at least $300 billion.
The stadium’s other developers, a joint venture of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, are also not without substantial resources. Stephen Ross, founder and chair of Related Cos., is worth nearly $12 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Sterling Equities was co-founded by Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, who, with Jeff Wilpon, sold the New York Mets to Steven Cohen, a hedge fund manager, for $2.4 billion in 2020.
Related Cos. and Sterling Equities will sublease the stadium to the soccer team, a spokesperson for the team said, but the terms of that economic agreement remain opaque.
“What you’re doing, in effect, is redistributing income from the general taxpayer to the very wealthy,” said Dennis Coates, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who focuses on sports economics.
Not only will the team’s owners not have to pay property taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, but the city is also kicking in an estimated $200 million to $300 million in infrastructure improvements for the entire project in Willets Point, which used to be home to the city’s largest collection of auto body repair and salvage shops before the city evicted them.
The Adams administration argues that this is an investment worth making.
“This analysis is based on the fabricated premise that a contaminated, languishing site divided among several property owners could be set aside for some mysterious theoretical use while generating the property tax revenue of a project that will create $6 billion in economic activity, 14,000 construction jobs and 2,500 affordable homes,” said Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the mayor. “To be clear, that scenario is entirely implausible, and Mayor Adams’ vision for Willets Point — which includes one of the most fiscally responsible stadium deals in recent history — will deliver substantial benefits while bringing in up to $4 million a year in rent for the city and critical infrastructure and resources to the entire Willets Point community.”
The plan has its supporters.
James Patchett, a former president of the Economic Development Corp. who now works in real estate, noted that the Willets Point land has been contaminated by decades of use as a home for auto body shops, and he argued that the development options there were limited without some form of government subsidy.
“The notion that there is a real revenue-generating, taxpaying use to be built at this site apart from a casino is just not realistic,” Patchett said. “It’s unusual also to see a stadium deal that is not being financed with tax-exempt bonds, which I think is something that is certainly in favor of this deal.”
A spokesperson for the soccer team said the stadium would “bring record affordable housing, billions in economic activity, a public school and thousands of jobs to Queens.”
The city and state helped the Mets and Yankees build their current stadiums on city land, including via the use of tax-exempt bonds. In 2009, the Independent Budget Office calculated the value of city and state subsidies for both stadiums at a cumulative $762.3 million.
Although the Bills secured nearly $1 billion in construction subsidies from the state and Erie County for their stadium project, New York and other major cities such as Oakland, California, and Los Angeles have pushed back against wealthy sports teams in recent years.
“It seems that periodically, there is a short-term blip where people recognize that this isn’t such a great use of tax dollars,” Coates said.
In 2005, the Jets’ attempt to build a stadium on public land on the west side of Manhattan with the backing of Mayor Michael Bloomberg ran into stiff opposition from James Dolan, owner of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. Lawmakers in Albany, the state’s capital, ultimately shot down the proposal.
Dolan, who also owns Madison Square Garden, has his own subsidies in the form of city property tax exemptions, passed by the state in 1982, that are now worth an estimated $43 million a year. Politicians have been trying to overturn the exemption for years.
“It’s a 100%, 49-year subsidy. I mean, that’s big. That’s Amazon HQ 2-level subsidy,” said Jensen, referring to the multicity competition to host Amazon’s second headquarters, which involved offers of substantial government subsidies. “A lot of communities didn’t even offer that large for thousands of jobs.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Democratic Senators Press Southwest Over Meltdown
A group of Democratic senators are seeking an explanation from Southwest Airlines for its operational meltdown last month. In a letter sent on Wednesday to Southwest's chief executive, Bob Jordan, the lawmakers posed dozens of questions to the airline, addressing topics like its flight-crew scheduling system, ticket refunds and executive compensation. The letter was signed by 13 members of the Senate Democratic caucus, including Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who spearheaded it. "No business can treat its customers like that and get away with it," Mr. Markey said. Around Christmas, a storm wreaked havoc on Southwest's operations, leaving travelers stranded during the busy holiday travel season. While other airlines were able to recover, Southwest found itself crippled, in part as a result of outdated scheduling technology for its flight crews. In total, the airline canceled more than 16,700 flights. MARK WALKER

Porsche Considers Deal To Put Google in Cockpit
Porsche is considering fully integrating Google software into its car cockpit, a source close to the company said on Thursday. The deal would enable Porsche customers access to applications like Google Maps and Google Assistant without needing to connect the car to an Android phone. Porsche had previously been reluctant to use Google software because Google asked for too much data to be shared, according to Manager Magazin, which first reported the talks. Technology companies from Google to Apple and Amazon are in a race to control carmakers' dashboards as software becomes an integral part of car design. But some automakers are wary of allowing the tech giants unfettered access to the data generated by connected cars, or to allow them to displace the automakers' brands with their own in dashboard displays. BMW, for example, was "definitely not taking the path" of integrating Google Automotive Services into its cars, a spokesperson said. REUTERS

CNN Plans to Move Out Of CNN Center in Atlanta
CNN is moving out of the CNN Center, its longtime downtown Atlanta home, by the end of this year. The cable channel's weekday anchors are all already in New York or Washington, but CNN still has digital and CNN International operations in Atlanta. A spokeswoman, Bridget Leininger, confirmed in an email that the remaining CNN employees and operations in Atlanta would move to the Techwood Turner Broadcasting campus in Midtown. The move will happen in stages and will finish by the end of this year, Leininger said. CNN's previous parent company, AT&T, sold the CNN Center for nearly $ 164 million to two Florida-based real estate firms, CP Group and Rialto Capital, in 2021, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the building's other tenants. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Gillian Jacobs's blank slate protagonist floats through a series of encounters in this feature-length movie made up of short films.
A director's career is often measured by the quality and quantity of their feature films. But short films can offer a chance to experiment with styles and subjects that might not be suited for a wider commercial release. "The Seven Faces of Jane" combines these two modes of production to create an omnibus film; it's a feature-length movie comprising short films made by emerging directors.
At the center of each short story is Jane (played by Gillian Jacobs, who also directs the first of the movie's shorts), a single mother who opens the movie by dropping off her daughter at summer camp in Malibu. The film's episodic story follows Jane as she floats through a series of encounters during her week of solitude in Southern California. She begins with a surreal trip to a roadside diner, but her journeys take her to the desert, the beach and the mountains. She connects with strangers, as well as lovers, including a former flame played by Joel McHale, who starred on the TV series "Community" with Jacobs.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jane is a bit of a blank slate as a protagonist, and her flatness feels jarring when she encounters other characters with more depth. One episode introduces Tayo (Chido Nwokocha), an ex of Jane's who describes feeling alienated from his Blackness and sense of self during their relationship. Another sequence finds Jane teaching the steps of a waltz to a teenager dreading the dances at her quinceañera. Jane acts as a sounding board when these characters describe their feelings about their specific cultures. Yet in her responses, she remains as two-dimensional as a sketch on white paper.
The directors -- Jacobs, Gia Coppola, Boma Iluma, Ryan Heffington, Xan Cassavetes, Julian J. Acosta, Ken Jeong (another of Jacobs's "Community" castmates) and Alex Takacs -- come from a wide range of creative and personal backgrounds. But the shorts blend together without significant variation. The transitions eschew title cards, subtly eliding shifts by returning to images of Jane in her car.
There is continuity in this makeshift road picture‌ -- Jane's costumes and makeup remain cohesive across the shorts, and the film's segments keep the same cool color palette. But the consistency limits the ability of the directors to lean into their own style, leading to a movie that feels narratively scattered and stylistically inhibited.
The Seven Faces of Jane
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes. In theaters and available to rent or buy on Amazon, Google Play and other streaming platforms and pay TV operators.

Full text: Our TV critic recommends checking out a distinctive stand-up special, a tender tennis documentary and a true-crime mockumentary you might have missed.
This weekend I have ... an hour, and I want stand-up.
'Atsuko Okatsuka: The Intruder'
When to watch: Now, on HBO Max.
In her new special, which dropped at the beginning of December, the comedian Atsuko Okatsuka jokes about being raised by her grandmother, the odd dynamics that arose from learning dance routines with her husband and her ill-conceived choices for pandemic hobbies. ("Stop! That's someone else's interest," her husband tells her when she is on the brink of planting lettuce.) Okatsuka plays around a lot with pace, using repetition to change the tempo of different segments, and her crowd work has a special and distinctive energy.
... a few hours, and I want a sports documentary.
'Break Point'
When to watch: Arrives Friday, on Netflix.
This tennis documentary series comes from some of the same producers as the addictive "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," and "Break Point" shares a similar tender affection for its subjects but has a more episodic style, with each installment focusing on only a few players at a time. Because there's less emphasis on a season-long arc, one can pick and choose among the episodes: I especially liked Episode 4, which follows Ons Jabeur and Paula Badosa and outlines some of the financial realities of professional tennis and the unique pressures female athletes face. Five episodes drop now, and five more are scheduled to arrive in June.
... several hours, and I want a comedy.
'Trial & Error'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
When "Trial & Error" debuted on NBC back in 2017, it didn't make much of a splash, but I wonder if this mockumentary would do better if it came out now, alongside quirky-ensemble comedies like "Ghosts" or "Abbott Elementary." The show is set in a small town and follows a big-city lawyer and his high-profile defendants: in Season 1, a weirdo professor (played by John Lithgow), and in Season 2, a local celebrity (played by Kristin Chenoweth). "Trial" is warm and silly, and many of its characters would be at home in Pawnee or Flatch. If you've ever struggled to place the song stuck in your head and realized at long last that it was the intro music to "Serial," watch this.

Microsoft Bets Big on the Creator of ChatGPT in Race to Dominate AI

SAN FRANCISCO — When a chatbot called ChatGPT hit the internet late last year, executives at a number of Silicon Valley companies worried they were suddenly dealing with new artificial intelligence technology that could disrupt their businesses.
But at Microsoft, it was a cause for celebration. For several years, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, had been putting the pieces in place for this moment.
In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the tiny San Francisco company that designed ChatGPT. And in the years since, it has quietly invested another $2 billion, according to two people familiar with the investment who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.
The $3 billion paid for the huge amounts of computing power that OpenAI needed to build the chatbot. And it meant that Microsoft could rapidly build and deploy new products based on the technology.
Microsoft is now poised to challenge Big Tech competitors like Google, Amazon and Apple with a technological advantage the company has not possessed for more than two decades. Microsoft is in talks to invest another $10 billion in OpenAI as it seeks to push its technology even further, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The potential $10 billion deal — which would mainly provide OpenAI with even larger amounts of computing power — has not been finalized and the funding amount could change. But the talks are indicative of the tech giant’s determination to be on the leading edge of what has become the hottest technology in the tech industry.
Nadella worked with AI technologies when he ran Microsoft’s Bing search engine more than a decade ago, and for several years he has convened a biweekly internal meeting of AI leaders.
“The expectation from Satya is that we’re pushing the envelope in AI, and we’re going to do that across our products,” Eric Boyd, the executive responsible for Microsoft’s AI platform team, said in an interview.
Microsoft’s new talks with OpenAI were reported earlier by Semafor. Its additional $2 billion investment in the company was earlier reported by The Information and Fortune.
ChatGPT answers questions, writes poetry and riffs on almost any topic tossed its way. Based on earlier technologies called GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, it is the most conspicuous example of technology called generative artificial intelligence, the term for a system that can generate text, images, sounds and other media in response to short prompts.
“It has already been a home run partly because Satya was prescient enough to make the bet three years ago, and because all applications will be generative in the future,” said Matt McIlwain, a managing partner at Seattle’s Madrona Venture Group.
The new generative AI technologies could reinvent everything from online search engines like Google to digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. Microsoft sees these technologies as a way of expanding and improving its already wide range of products for businesses, computer programmers and consumers, while boosting revenues across its Azure cloud computing services.
“It is just fascinating to see how these generative models are capturing the imagination,” Nadella told developers in India last week, adding, “I think it is a golden age.”
OpenAI is working on an even more powerful system called GPT-4, which could be released as soon as this quarter, according to McIlwain and four other people with knowledge of the effort. Microsoft declined to comment on its future product plans.
Built using Microsoft’s huge network for computer data centers, the new chatbot could be a system much like ChatGPT that solely generates text. Or it could juggle images as well as text. Some venture capitalists and Microsoft employees have already seen the service in action. But OpenAI has not yet determined whether the new system will be released with capabilities involving images.
OpenAI is led by Sam Altman, who became well known in Silicon Valley as the head of startup builder Y Combinator. Altman, 37, and his co-founders created OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit. But he soon remade the venture as a for-profit company that could more aggressively pursue financing.
A year later, Microsoft invested $1 billion in the company and committed to building the supercomputer technologies OpenAI’s enormous models would demand while becoming its “preferred partner for commercializing” its technologies. OpenAI later officially licensed its technologies to Microsoft, allowing the company to directly add them to Microsoft products and services.
With backing from Microsoft, OpenAI went on to build a milestone technology called GPT-3. Known as a “large language model,” it could generate text on its own, including tweets, blog posts, news articles and even computer code.
Clunky to use, it was mostly a tool for businesses and engineers. But a year later, OpenAI began work on DALL-E, which allowed anyone to generate realistic images simply by describing what they want to see. Microsoft incorporated GPT-3, DALL-E and similar technologies into its own products.
GitHub, a popular online service for programmers owned by Microsoft, began offering a programming tool called Copilot. As programmers built smartphone apps and other software, Copilot suggested the next line of code as they typed, much the way autocomplete tools suggest the next word as you type texts or emails.
For many, it was a “jaw dropping moment” that showed what’s possible, Boyd, of Microsoft, said.
Then, at the end of last year, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT. More than 1 million people tested the chatbot during its first few days online. It answered trivia questions, explained ideas and generated everything from school papers to pop song lyrics.
Microsoft last year began incorporating DALL-E image creations into its Bing search engine, and is working with OpenAI on a new version of the search engine that would include technology along the lines of ChatGPT, according to The Information.
Google, Meta and other companies have spent years building models similar to ChatGPT. The AI systems develop their skills by analyzing enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, computer programs and chat logs.
“Building these systems really requires a supercomputer — and there are not many of them on the planet,” said Aiden Gomez, a former Google researcher who founded Cohere, a startup that has built technology to ChatGPT.
In 2019, Altman told The New York Times that most of Microsoft’s $1 billion investment came in the form of the computing power OpenAI needs — and that Microsoft would eventually become the lab’s sole source of computing power.
Microsoft and OpenAI have built a new kind of supercomputer specifically for ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies. That means Microsoft can readily offer these systems to its own customers.
Microsoft and OpenAI hope they can improve these systems by training them on larger amounts of data and most experts agree their skills will improve. Right now, Microsoft acknowledges, they can “hallucinate” answers by mixing fact and fiction.
Speaking in India last week, Nadella presented data that indicated as much as 10% of all data could be AI-generated in just three years, which could lead to as much as $7 billion in revenue for Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing product, said Gil Luria who researches Microsoft for the investment bank D.A. Davidson.
These technologies still come with a long list of flaws and question marks. They often produce toxic content, including misinformation, hate speech and images that are biased against women and people of color.
Microsoft, Google, Meta and other companies have been reluctant to release many of these technologies because of the potential damage to their established brands. Five years ago, Microsoft quickly backtracked after releasing a chatbot called Tay that generated racist, xenophobic and otherwise filthy language.
Mike Volpi, a partner with the venture capital firm Index Ventures, who was among the early investors in generative AI, said the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership is one of the many contenders hoping to control where the technology is headed.
“There is an argument to be made that they all end up smelling the same,” he said. “There is another argument that what OpenAI is doing is truly special and that all the money goes to them.”

Analysts Look to Corporate Reports With Lowered Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As companies prepare to publish their latest financial results, Wall Street forecasters expect profits to fall for the first time since the early days of the pandemic.
The analysts who forecast the fortunes of corporate America have rarely been more pessimistic at the start of a year than they are in 2023.
The country's largest companies are about to start publicly reporting their quarterly financial results, when analysts will pepper company management with questions about profits and losses and try to glean hints about what to expect in the months ahead. Coming after the S&P 500-stock index fell nearly 20 percent last year, these reports could help buoy the market if things aren't as bad as they seem, or drag it down further.
On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and others will set the tone, providing a window on the state of the economy, consumer confidence and business activity in their financial releases.
Wall Street's prognosticators predict that companies in the S&P 500 are about to reveal an aggregate fall in profit of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, versus the same period a year ago, according to FactSet, the first decline since the early days of the pandemic. They also expect earnings to continue falling in the first half before rebounding to finish up 4 percent for the full year, according to data collected by Goldman Sachs going back to 1986.
That may not sound so bad, yet it stands out as the lowest forecast in recent history. That's worse than was expected at the beginning of 2009, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and worse than at the start of 2002, as the dot-com bubble was rapidly deflating.
Analysts are balancing soaring inflation and interest rates against a resilient economy and some signs that inflation has peaked. They also tend to be a preternaturally optimistic bunch, so their not-so-great expectations are still cause for alarm for those who parse earnings forecasts, price targets and other ephemera produced by market watchers on Wall Street.
"It tells you expectations are already low," said Ben Snider, an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. "I don't want to paint a picture that analysts are overly pessimistic. I think the estimates are reflecting what is a mediocre growth environment."
For months, investors have been waiting for the bottom to fall out for corporate America. The rising costs of everything from energy to raw materials and labor stoked fears that profitability would plummet. However, many companies have been able to pass on higher costs to consumers without denting their sales, propping up profit margins and generating cash to spend on operations or dividends and share buybacks, which directly benefit investors.
That may be about to change.
Amazon is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings that are almost 50 percent less than the year before. Expectations for profits at Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, which have an outsize impact on stock indexes because of their size, have also dropped, according to the FactSet. Big technology firms have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent weeks.
However, all that information is immediately reflected in stock prices, or so the theory goes. That's why investors and analysts pay such close attention to comments by corporate executives about how they see the future panning out, even if earnings calls are ostensibly held to talk about the past.
On these calls, analysts mix praise of management with pointed questions about the feasibility of their strategies. The discussion this quarter will probably focus on the effects of high inflation and interest rates, the likelihood of recession, and layoffs. Investors will also been listening for signals about the effect of China's reopening as well as the impact of new taxes on corporate income.
And investors are wise to the common practice of executives talking down their companies' prospects, giving themselves wiggle room for underperformance or simply a lower bar to beat and boost to their company's stock price.
"Recent client conversations indicate some skeptical investors are wary that managements might low-ball" their latest results and the outlook for 2023, Goldman's analysts wrote in a recent research note.
Yet there is also reason to be genuinely cautious.
Inflation remains stubbornly high, so the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates, tightening the screws on the economy. Central bank officials have been adamant that the economy needs to soften in order to bring down inflation, and that implies more layoffs and weaker consumer demand, which makes it harder for companies to raise prices.
This week, the Walt Disney Company announced changes to its pricing policy at theme parks, an acknowledgment that it may have pushed too hard in pursuit of profit, while FedEx said it would further pare back some weekend delivery services as demand waned for its services.
"Big picture, we care about what is happening with demand and what is happening to companies' costs," said Ron Temple, the chief market strategist at Lazard.
Goldman's analysts don't expect earnings of companies in the S&P 500 to grow at all this year, a more downbeat forecast than the average. The bank itself laid off up to 3,200 people this week.
The biggest risk for companies and the stock market remains the Fed's campaign to constrain the economy and lower inflation, potentially pushing the economy into recession. Goldman's analysts see a potential earnings decline of more than 10 percent this year in that scenario.
"What worries me is that there is this sense that we may still come through this period with very little going wrong," Mr. Temple said. "There is too much complacency."

Coinbase Sheds Another 20% of Its Employees: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The cuts at the cryptocurrency exchange come after nearly a fifth of employees were let go in June, as crypto markets teeter and tech companies rethink their growth plans.
Coinbase, the cryptocurrency trading platform, said on Tuesday that it would lay off about 20 percent of its employees, its latest move to cut costs as crypto markets decline and tech companies lower their expectations for growth.
The company is laying off about 950 people, it said in a memo to staff, which comes after it cut around 1,100 employees in June, also about a fifth of its work force at the time.
Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's chief executive, said in the memo that "in hindsight, we could have cut further" in the layoffs announced last year. He also implied that the collapse of FTX, which generated turmoil throughout the crypto industry, was having an impact on Coinbase.
"In 2022, the crypto market trended downwards along with the broader macroeconomy," Mr. Armstrong wrote. "We also saw the fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry, and there could still be further contagion."
The downturn in crypto has put pressure on companies like Coinbase, which went public in 2021 and expanded rapidly during the pandemic. The price of Bitcoin has fallen more than 70 percent from its 2021 peak.
A number of technology companies, including Amazon, Meta and Salesforce, have recently announced layoffs, with many -- like Coinbase -- saying that they hired too aggressively during a burst of activity in the earlier stages of the pandemic. Higher interest rates, stubborn inflation and other factors that slowed the economy since then have forced many executives to rethink their plans.
Coinbase said its latest cuts were part of a plan to reduce costs by 25 percent this quarter. The layoffs would cost between $ 149 million and $ 163 million, Coinbase said. The company is offering employees who were laid off at least 14 weeks of base pay, health insurance and assistance finding a next job.
Still, Mr. Armstrong said some of the recent developments in the crypto world, including the fall of what he described as "a large competitor," could "end up benefiting Coinbase greatly."

For Prince Harry's Book, Chaos and Brisk Sales: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A litany of leaks and interview clips before the book's publication has made the process hard for the publisher to control, but has also driven early interest.
The details streaming from leaks and interview teasers in advance of Prince Harry's memoir, "Spare," have been sensational, even explosive. News organizations around the world have covered them breathlessly.
There's Harry's description of his brother, William, knocking him to the floor during a fight, and Harry's admission that he killed 25 people in Afghanistan. There's also his claim that William and his wife, Kate, encouraged him to dress up as a Nazi, and his recollection of losing his virginity to an older woman in a field behind a bar.
A tell-all by a member of the British royal family was bound to be a nightmare to manage. Big books, widely anticipated books, will often leak, despite publishers' best attempts to keep the process tightly orchestrated. But the contents of Harry's memoir have been excavated to such a degree that it has raised the question: Will readers still be curious enough to buy the book?
So far, it looks like the answer is yes. The media frenzy seems to be driving interest in the memoir, which is due out Tuesday. "Spare" held the No. 1 spot on Amazon in the United States and Britain on Friday, as well as at Barnes & Noble. Booksellers and distributors said that preorders are enormous and growing with the avalanche of press coverage.
Still, the extraordinary volume of leaks highlighted the challenges, and perhaps the impossibility, of choreographing the release of what may be the most anticipated and divisive celebrity memoir of all time.
Many of the memoir's eye-popping revelations have already spilled in leaks, and some of the most dramatic moments from the interviews Harry gave promoting the book have circulated online as teasers. This was all preceded by a six-part Netflix documentary, "Harry & Meghan," which aired in December, and where Harry made incendiary accusations against his family, including a claim that his brother's communications aides planted negative stories about his wife, Meghan Markle, in the London tabloids.
Despite the risk that blanket coverage could lead to Harry and Meghan fatigue, many booksellers expect the memoir to be an unmitigated success. Random House has said it is printing 2.5 million hardcover copies for North America alone. Ingram, the book wholesaler, has 90,000 copies in its warehouses to restock stores that run out. ReaderLink, which distributes books to chain stores like Target and Walmart, said it had ordered about 300,000 copies. Barnes & Noble has also ordered hundreds of thousands of copies.
James Daunt, who heads Barnes & Noble and the British bookstore chain Waterstones, said that even the negative leaks have been driving up customer interest in "Spare," and that he expects to see "the most extraordinary" first-day and first-week sales.
After The Guardian obtained a copy of the book and revealed some of its biggest bombshells, reservations for in-store purchases of the book shot up in Britain, he said.
"This one has really whipped up a level of press hysteria that I really struggle to think of one that's comparable," Daunt said. "All it does is build up this great excitement, which gets people into bookstores."
Ever since Penguin Random House announced in 2021 that they had acquired a memoir by Harry -- who stunned the world when he and his wife announced they were parting ways with the royal family -- the book's content has been the subject of intense speculation in the publishing world, in the British tabloids and among royal watchers.
Publishers often guard against leaks with strict embargoes, in some cases requiring anyone who works on the book, including typesetters and copy editors, to sign nondisclosure agreements. Retailers are often required to sign an affidavit agreeing to store books in a monitored, locked and secure area if they get copies before the on-sale date. Some publishing executives even choose not to send highly anticipated books to airport bookstores because they tend to pay less attention to embargoes.
Matt Latimer, a founder of the literary agency Javelin, which has handled many books by high-profile politicians, said he has never seen an embargoed book leak from within a publishing house or printing plant. It's in the days before publication, when the books have to be put on trucks and shipped to stores, that the revelations start.
"I call this the danger zone," Latimer said. "The week or two before publication, there is almost always a leak."
A simultaneous international release complicates this delicate process further. "Spare" will be released in 16 languages at the same time, multiplying opportunities for leaks: In Spain, the book accidentally went on sale early on Thursday.
Publishing executives say that leaks can be beneficial if they drive the right kind of media coverage, and drum up interest in the book. During the Trump era, some of the most explosive information in tell-all books by journalists and former administration officials often leaked out early and dominated cable news coverage for days, which catapulted titles to the top of the best seller lists. But in some cases, books that are built around news nuggets can see their sales nosedive after the news cycle is exhausted and the media has moved on.
It's too soon to say whether the overall sales trajectory of Harry's memoir will be affected by the steady drip of revelations. Many readers will buy the book for an intimate view of Prince Harry's life from his perspective, not just for bomblets of news. Harry has partnered with a highly regarded ghostwriter, J.R. Moehringer, and a cascade of articles does not offer the same narrative journey as a well-crafted book. And his story, while ripe for tabloid fodder, also deals with universal themes like race, class, and the sometimes tortured relationships between brothers or between fathers and sons. The book's title refers to a phrase that Charles is reported to have used to refer to Harry, his second son, as his "spare," or back up heir, since he'd already secured an heir in Harry's older brother.
"It's ridiculous and it's fun, but it's also clearly going to be an interesting book that's going to keep on selling and it's going to keep on being part of the conversation," said Daunt, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble.
"We're making a bet that this book has got legs," he said. "It's not going to be a flash in the pan."

Full text: I love a crisp white shirt with a good collar and a little length that can be dressed up or casual. I am drawn to well-made, classic white shirts and would ideally like to have several, in rotation, so they need to be reasonably priced. Have you ever found a unicorn such as this?
Sarah, Cleveland Heights, Ohio In 2020, Alexandra Shulman, the former editor of British Vogue, published a memoir that included an entire chapter devoted to the white shirt. "These pieces," she wrote, "are masters of illusion."
"They signify order and neatness, professionalism and authority," she went on -- and also "unshowy competence." They can be "shorthand for 'the real me."'
I think she was underselling the matter.
White shirts are that magic garment that can be all things to all people: a symbol of efficiency and power synonymous with corporate headshots everywhere, as well as relaxation and ease. Think Marilyn Monroe in jeans on the beach, her white shirt knotted just so at the waist, or Meghan Markle making her royal-date debut at the Invictus Games with Prince Harry.
They are suitable for the Oscars red carpet (see Sharon Stone in 1998, when she wore a Gap white shirt with a long Vera Wang satin skirt) and a walk through land mines (Princess Diana in Angola in 1997). The white shirt can be downtown cool -- Patti Smith on the cover of "Horses," in a white shirt undone at the neck, a suit jacket slung over the shoulder -- and uptown haute. It's gender neutral. There's almost no one who doesn't look good in one.
As a result, the perfect white button-up is a garment that floats like a mirage on the landscape of the mind, just out of reach. It's the fashion equivalent of the blank page. Which is why the designer Anne Fontaine, who started her namesake business with a line of only white shirts in 1993, is still able to offer new styles every year.
So how to choose? White shirts range from the very inexpensive (Amazon Essentials has one for $ 13.60) to the semi-outrageous. A Charvet cotton poplin shirt will cost you $ 568. Karl Lagerfeld, who was famous for his high-collar white shirts and owned about 1,000, bought his at the British tailor Hilditch & Key, where a standard white shirt runs about £140 (about $ 165).
For a less expensive version, the basic white shirt from Brooks Brothers in Supima cotton is a good place to start, especially if crisply traditional is what is desired. Also check out the shirts from the Shirt (the name says it all), which achieved Oprah-approved fame with the promise of "no-gap" buttons, as well as Alex Mill and Sezane, which offers a slightly more insouciant Gallic version of the classic.
If you want to test different details -- shaped at the waist, different pocket placements and so on -- try the Frankie Shop.
Whatever you end up with, remember that careful laundering and storage are key to keeping a white shirt fresh and preserving its appeal. Dry cleaning is not necessary, but ironing is important. Nothing ruins the promise of a white shirt like a splotchy souvenir of last week's Bolognese.

Here’s What to Know About Brazil’s Presidential Election

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Brazilians headed to the polls in October to elect a new president in a bruising runoff between two candidates offering starkly different visions for the future of Latin America’s biggest democracy.
The vote came after a long and ugly campaign that pitted the right-wing incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, against the two-term former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Bolsonaro rallied supporters around what he called a leftist attack on family values and individual liberties. He cast academics, the media and even democratic institutions, including Brazil’s Congress and Supreme Court, as enemies.
Lula, who ultimately won the election, vowed to govern for all Brazilians, while returning the country to a more prosperous past, although his history of corruption scandals divided voters.
Much of the campaign, which was marked by misinformation and vicious online attacks, devolved into mudslinging with little discussion of the challenges the country’s next leader would face.
What were the issues?
The election came at a crucial moment for Brazil, where surging food and fuel prices, coupled with a painful economic slowdown, have caused poverty to surge, reversing decades of social and economic progress.
Environmental and climate worries also loomed large. Deforestation in the Amazon hit 15-year highs under Bolsonaro, who weakened environmental protections and argued that the rainforest should be opened to mining, ranching and agriculture. The Amazon’s destruction — and its effects on the efforts to avert a climate crisis — has turned Brazil into a global outcast.
There were also concerns about the health of Brazil’s democracy. Bolsonaro sowed doubts about the integrity of the electoral system, claiming without evidence that the country’s electronic voting machines could be rigged. His efforts fueled worries at home and abroad that a potential loss for Bolsonaro would prompt him to rally his millions of supporters to take to the streets and demand that he remain in power.
What did Lula propose?
Lula oversaw an era of growth during his two terms in office, when a commodity-fueled boom turned Brazil into a global success story. He promised to return the country to those glory days.
The leftist candidate vowed to raise taxes on the rich and boost public spending, “putting the people in the budget.” His plans include a slew of social programs, such as a $113 monthly cash voucher rivaling the one proposed by Bolsonaro. Poor families with children will also receive an additional $28 per month for each child younger than 6.
Lula also promised to adjust Brazil’s minimum wage in step with inflation and revive a housing plan for the poor, while guaranteeing food security for people facing hunger.
A former trade unionist, Lula planned to kick start growth and “create work and employment opportunities” by spending on infrastructure. But he also planned to invest in a “green economy,” warning that Brazil must shift to more sustainable energy and food systems.
On the Amazon, Lula has signaled that he will crack down on environmental crimes by militias, land grabbers, loggers and others.
What did Bolsonaro propose?
Bolsonaro promised to hand out cash payments of about $113 a month to needy families, extending a temporary policy originally created to ease the pandemic’s blow. The plan was designed to “reduce poverty and contribute to sustainable economic growth,” according to Bolsonaro’s official policy plan.
Before the election, Bolsonaro spent heavily on welfare and fuel subsidies.
He also pledged to create jobs by eliminating bureaucratic red tape, slashing taxes and investing in technology. In a further nod to business leaders, who provided him vital support during his first run for president, Bolsonaro said he would maintain a free market approach and keep public debt in check.
Echoing the rhetoric that won him support from ultraconservative and evangelical voters four years ago, Bolsonaro also promised to defend “the family,” opposing legal abortion and transgender education in schools.
Bolsonaro also promised to expand tough-on-crime policies, pledging to further expand access to firearms, a policy he credits for a drop in violent crime across Brazil.
How did Bolsonaro sow doubts about the election’s legitimacy?
Brazilians cast ballots on electronic voting machines, a system that has been in place for more than two decades and that has been the focus of Bolsonaro’s claims about the risk of election fraud.
Bolsonaro has framed a hack of Brazil’s election agency in 2018 as evidence of fraud, although an investigation showed that the hackers were not able to change vote totals or access voting machines.
Bolsonaro has also pointed to Lula’s past corruption charges, which were nullified, as proof that he was a thief planning to steal the vote.
Flawed polls also raised questions about the credibility of polling firms and gave credence to Bolsonaro’s claims that the surveys did not accurately reflect his popularity. In the first round of voting, Lula won 48% of the vote, while Bolsonaro received 43%, significantly outperforming preelection polls. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Bill Miller
Through Jan. 14. dieFirma, 32A Cooper Square, Manhattan; 347-699-1440; diefirmanyc.com.
Once upon a time, linoleum floors conjured the gleaming promise of the modern century: vibrant and new, a marvel of science and convenience. By midcentury, it was de rigueur in American kitchens, synonymous with the country's postwar perception of itself: hard wearing, resilient, never to fade. The sheen, like much of the rest of the American dream proved to be held together by asbestos, has since worn off; Americans pulled up their linoleum floors and tossed them into the dustbin of decorative history.
The artist Bill Miller resuscitates that past, and its attendant ghosts, splicing found linoleum sheets into dense, nearly hallucinatory collages depicting the landscapes and modest domestic interiors of the postindustrial towns he's known. Miller doesn't manipulate the finishes, relying on the factory-made colors and often assaultive patterns for his palette, a self-imposed constriction that becomes expansive freedom. It proves to be a remarkably versatile medium, and an affecting one. Miller salvages much of his material from abandoned homes in and around Pittsburgh, where he lives, and whose collapsed steel industry both allows for and tints the work here.
The conceptual interest could quickly become stale, but Miller's choices avoid gimmickry. His dedication to his material reads as devotional and empathetic, portraying the lives of his blue-collar subjects through the very stuff with which they were furnished. His pictures have a haunted quality; marks of wear remain visible, traces of the linoleum's previous life still present, faded but not forgotten. MAX LAKIN
'El Corazón Aúlla'
Through Jan. 21. The 8th Floor, 17 West 17th Street, Manhattan; 646-839-5908, the8thfloor.org.
Performance art may not be as radical as it was in the 1970s, but the exhibition "El Corazón Aúlla" ("The Heart Howls") reaffirms what a potent vehicle it is for subversive expression. Curated by Alexis Heller and Tatiana Muñoz-Brenes, the show features 14 Latin American female and nonbinary artists calling attention to a crisis of gender-based violence: According to the Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean, at least 12 women per day were victims of femicide in the region in 2021. The artists take different approaches -- performing in public and private, alone or with others -- but are united by their unflinching vulnerability. They put their bodies on the line.
This includes Denise E. Reyes Amaya lying covered in garbage bags in the gutter of a San Salvador street in the video "Colored Bags for Trash" (2014); it's equally harrowing to watch passers-by ignore her and police officers poke her. In the video "Las Nobodies" (2011), the Mexican artist Nayla Altamirano walks meditatively along the border, collecting and donning bras left in the desert by the coyotes who sexually assaulted the women they were smuggling to the United States.
Some artists extend their vulnerability outward, like Elina Chauvet, who, in "My Hair for Your Name" (2014), cut off her locks and tied them with ribbons bearing the names of murdered women. Here, alongside those hanging locks and performance photos, the Mexican artist has set up a station where visitors are invited to do the same, pushing us to consider what we might be willing to risk or give up in sacrifice. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Anton van Dalen
Through Jan. 28. PPOW Gallery, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-647-1044, ppowgallery.com.
Anton van Dalen's training as a graphic artist is immediately apparent in his vivid prints and paintings, as well as his link to the East Village art scene in the 1980s, where graffiti, activist posters and wheat-pasted fliers ruled. The 47 pieces in "Doves: Where They Live and Work" surveys the oeuvre of the artist, who was born in the Netherlands in 1938 and moved to New York in 1966.
Van Dalen's style is mechanically surrealistic, recalling early-20th-century artists like Giorgio de Chirico and Francis Picabia, as well as '80s peers like Keith Haring and Mark Kostabi. Like these artists, his aesthetic world is simultaneously seductive and menacing. "The Horror Show of Science" (1981), a stark mural-size canvas, uses diagram-like images to show what science and technology have wrought, such as the atomic bomb and animal testing. Other paintings and drawings on lined notebook paper feature fighter planes, tanks ("war toys"), the effects of real estate development, the terror and isolation of the pandemic and how corporate giants like Coke, Amazon and Facebook have infiltrated our lives.
Birds also appear frequently here, serving, as the gallery release states, as emblems of "migration, freedom, peace, and community." Since 1971, van Dalen has also raised white pigeons that lived on the roof of his East Village building. It is a remarkable detail: The world is affected by upheavals and migrations, but van Dalen, his work and his activist approach have remained local, stable and consistent. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Damar Hamlin: Hard Truths About Football: [Letter]

To the Editor:
Re "A Nightmare That Unfolded in Prime Time" (front page, Jan. 4):
Professional football has never been more popular, but the devastating injury to Damar Hamlin -- not to mention the concussions suffered by numerous other players this season -- raises this question: Why do we tolerate football?
Are we really so callous that we think it is fine for men to play an inherently brutal "game" that will lead to crippling injuries for many, and death for some? If we do, have we really advanced civilization since the Romans cheered the gladiators?
(I write as a recovering pro football fan who still relapses now and then.)
Jonathan J. Margolis
Brookline, Mass.
To the Editor:
To those of us who watch and enjoy football and all the spectacles surrounding it, the injury to Damar Hamlin brings some hard truths into focus.
The football business is huge. An N.F.L. game brings major dollars and jobs to the cities that host games and opportunities to the rare players, coaches and staff who make it to the elite levels of college football and the pros. We are not going to ban the game.
But we don't need the expanded schedules, which have gone from 14 to 16 and now 17 games. We don't need the expanded playoffs, which give some mediocre teams an extra weekend or two before they go home.
Amazon would survive the loss of Thursday Night Football, and so would the viewers. A player who has survived a Sunday game needs more than three days to recover before subjecting himself to the same jarring violence all over again.
The sports gambling industry has brought a whole new intensity to the fans but helps dehumanize the players who are the subjects of the bets. Please make it illegal again.
Yes, players make millions, but that doesn't substitute for the risks of life and limb that their short careers and long post-football lives will need to thrive. Keep football, but give some thoughts to the players who make it all work.
Elliott Miller
Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
To the Editor:
It is a sad and a momentously singular moment of despair that affected everyone who saw or heard about Damar Hamlin collapsing to the ground.
The outpouring of concern, heartbreak, tears, compassion and hope were immediate. Opposite sides hugged and wept; those in charge halted the battle without resumption or rescheduling.
Sympathy and consolation abounded. No one wanted to go on; not the soldiers, the captains or the generals.
A type of truce over the devastating injury to one player.
Wouldn't that be remarkably good in another kind of battlefield?

Salesforce to Lay Off 10% of Staff and Cut Office Space: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Simonetti, Isabella; Huang, Kalley

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The software company plans to cut around 8,000 jobs as business slows for tech companies. "We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn," Salesforce's chief executive said.
Salesforce, the business software giant, said on Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
"The environment remains challenging, and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions," Marc Benioff, the company's co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce's revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Mr. Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
"We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that," Mr. Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokeswoman said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry's slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry's largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13 percent of its employees in November and said its head count would remain "roughly flat" through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat's parent company, laid off 20 percent of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $ 44 billion in October, has slashed the company's work force by more than half.
Salesforce's sales grew 14 percent in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce's co-chief executive, announced that he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month. In December, Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, also said he would leave his position by the end of this month. Salesforce bought Slack for $ 27.7 billion in 2020.
Salesforce is the largest private employer in San Francisco, and its flagship office building is the city's tallest.
The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $ 2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Mr. Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made "over the coming weeks," he wrote.
Salesforce's shares rose more than 3 percent in trading on Wednesday. The company's stock price fell nearly 50 percent last year.

E.U. Regulators Declare Meta's Ad Practices Illegal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The decision is one of the most consequential issued under the E.U.'s landmark data-protection law and creates a new business headwind for the social media giant.
Meta suffered a major defeat on Wednesday that could severely undercut its Facebook and Instagram advertising business after European Union regulators found it had illegally forced users to effectively accept personalized ads.
The decision, including a fine of 390 million euros ( $ 414 million), has the potential to require Meta to make costly changes to its advertising-based business in the European Union, one of its largest markets.
The ruling is one of the most consequential judgments since the 27-nation bloc, home to roughly 450 million people, enacted a landmark data-privacy law aimed at restricting the ability of Facebook and other companies from collecting information about users without their prior consent. The law took effect in 2018.
The case hinges on how Meta receives legal permission from users to collect their data for personalized advertising. The company's terms-of-service agreement -- the very lengthy statement that users must accept to gain access to services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp -- includes language that effectively means users must either allow their data to be used for personalized ads or stop using Meta's social media services altogether.
Ireland's data privacy board, which serves as Meta's main regulator in the European Union because the company's European headquarters are in Dublin, said E.U. authorities had determined that placing the legal consent within the terms of service essentially forced users to accept personalized ads, violating the European law known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R.
Meta has three months to outline how it will comply with the ruling. The decision does not specify what the company must do, but it could result in Meta's allowing users to choose whether they want their data used for such targeted promotions.
If a large number of users choose not to share their data, it would cut off one of the most valuable parts of Meta's business. Information about a user's digital history -- such as what videos on Instagram prompt a person to stop scrolling, or what types of links a person clicks when browsing Facebook feeds -- is used by marketers to get ads in front of people who are the most likely to buy. The practices helped Meta generate $ 118 billion in revenue in 2021.
The judgment puts 5 to 7 percent of Meta's overall advertising revenue at risk, according to Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. "This could be a major gut punch," he said.
The penalty contrasts with regulations in the United States, where there is no federal data privacy law and only a few states like California have taken steps to create rules similar to those in the European Union. But any changes that Meta makes as a result of the ruling could affect users in the United States; many tech companies apply E.U. rules globally because that is easier to put in effect than limiting them to Europe.
The E.U. judgment is the latest business headwind facing Meta, which was already grappling with a major drop in advertising revenue because of a change made by Apple in 2021 that gave iPhone users the ability to choose whether advertisers could track them. Meta said last year that Apple's changes would cost it about $ 10 billion in 2022, with consumer surveys suggesting that a clear majority of users have blocked tracking.
Meta's struggles come as it is trying to diversify its business from social media to the virtual reality world known as the metaverse. The company's stock price has plummeted more than 60 percent in the past year, and it has laid off thousands of employees.
Wednesday's announcement relates to two complaints filed against Meta in 2018. Meta said it would appeal the decision, setting up what could be a prolonged legal fight that tests the power of the G.D.P.R. and how aggressively regulators use the law to force companies to change their business practices.
"We strongly believe our approach respects G.D.P.R., and we're therefore disappointed by these decisions," Facebook said in a statement.
Privacy groups hailed the result as a long-overdue response to companies gobbling up as much data as possible about people online in order to deliver personalized ads. But critics also saw the more than four years it took to reach a decision as a sign that enforcement of the G.D.P.R. is weak and slow.
"European enforcement has not yet delivered on the promise of the G.D.P.R.," said Johnny Ryan, a privacy rights activists who is a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. The judgment signals that "Big Tech may be in for a far bumpier ride."
Within the European Union, there has been disagreement about how to enforce the G.D.P.R. Irish authorities said they had initially ruled that Meta's use of terms of service for permission was legally sufficient to comply with the law, but they were overruled by a board made up of representatives from all E.U. countries.
"There has been a lack of regulatory clarity on this issue, and the debate among regulators and policymakers around which legal basis is most appropriate in a given situation has been ongoing for some time," Meta said in its statement.
Helen Dixon, the head of Ireland's Data Protection Commission, said regulators must be an "honest broker" and not give in to demands from privacy activists who are pushing for rulings that would not stand up to legal challenges.
"We won't achieve results by simply seeking to rewrite the G.D.P.R. as we would have liked to have seen it written," Ms. Dixon said in an interview.
There are some signs in the European Union of a broader, stepped-up effort to crack down on the world's largest tech companies. New E.U. laws were passed last year aimed at stopping anticompetitive practices in the tech industry and forcing social media companies to more aggressively police user-generated content on their platforms. Last month, Amazon agreed to make key changes to how products are sold on its platform as part of a settlement with E.U. regulators to avoid antitrust charges.
In November, Meta was fined roughly $ 275 million by the Irish authorities for a data leak discovered last year that led to the personal information of more than 500 million Facebook users being published online.
In 2023, the European Union's top court, the European Court of Justice, is also expected to rule on cases that could lead to more changes to Meta's data-collection practices.
Yet many believe the enforcement has not matched the rhetoric of E.U. policymakers about strong tech regulation. Max Schrems, an Austrian data-protection activist whose nonprofit organization, NOYB, filed the complaints in 2018 that led to Wednesday's announcement, said thousands of data-protection complaints still needed to be addressed.
"On paper you have all these rights, but in reality the enforcement is just not happening," he said.

'Why Do We Tolerate Football?' On Damar Hamlin and the N.F.L.: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "A Nightmare That Unfolded in Prime Time" (front page, Jan. 4):
Professional football has never been more popular, but the devastating injury to Damar Hamlin -- not to mention the concussions suffered by numerous other players this season -- raises this question: Why do we tolerate football?
Are we really so callous that we think it is fine for men to play an inherently brutal "game" that will lead to crippling injuries for many, and death for some? If we do, have we really advanced civilization since the Romans cheered the gladiators?
(I write as a recovering pro football fan who still relapses now and then.)
Jonathan J. Margolis
Brookline, Mass.
To the Editor:
To those of us who watch and enjoy football and all the spectacles surrounding it, the injury to Damar Hamlin brings some hard truths into focus.
The football business is huge. An N.F.L. game brings major dollars and jobs to the cities that host games and opportunities to the rare players, coaches and staff who make it to the elite levels of college football and the pros. We are not going to ban the game.
But we don't need the expanded schedules, which have gone from 14 to 16 and now 17 games. We don't need the expanded playoffs, which give some mediocre teams an extra weekend or two before they go home.
Amazon would survive the loss of Thursday Night Football, and so would the viewers. A player who has survived a Sunday game needs more than three days to recover before subjecting himself to the same jarring violence all over again.
The sports gambling industry has brought a whole new intensity to the fans but helps dehumanize the players who are the subjects of the bets. Please make it illegal again.
Yes, players make millions, but that doesn't substitute for the risks of life and limb that their short careers and long post-football lives will need to thrive. Keep football, but give some thoughts to the players who make it all work.
Elliott Miller
Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
To the Editor:
It is a sad and a momentously singular moment of despair that affected everyone who saw or heard about Damar Hamlin collapsing to the ground.
The outpouring of concern, heartbreak, tears, compassion and hope were immediate. Opposing sides hugged and wept; those in charge halted the battle without resumption or rescheduling.
Sympathy and consolation abounded. No one wanted to go on; not the soldiers, the captains or the generals.
A type of truce over the devastating injury to one player.
Wouldn't that be remarkably good in another kind of battlefield?

Keep Supporting Charities, 'the Bedrock of American Society'
To the Editor:
Re "Before You Give to Charity, Some Thorny Questions to Weigh," by Peter Coy (Opinion, Dec. 28):
While, as Mr. Coy notes, philanthropy is shaped by the priorities of the ultrarich, that doesn't mean that Americans have stopped giving or that nonprofits aren't more vital than ever.
Nonprofits touch every aspect of our lives as enterprises advancing social good. They are on the front lines of combating poverty, advocating social justice and criminal justice reform, and carrying out innovations to combat climate change.
At the University of San Diego's Nonprofit Institute, our polling of locals finds that donating and volunteering remained relatively steady until the pandemic upended both and that the public trusts nonprofits to act on their behalf and promote positive social change to a far greater extent than government and corporations.
Charities are the bedrock of American society. More than ever, they deserve our generosity.

Salesforce to Lay Off 10% of Staff and Cut Office Space

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Salesforce, the business software giant, said Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
“The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions,” Marc Benioff, the company’s co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce’s revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
“We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that,” Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokesperson said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry’s slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry’s largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13% of its employees in November and said its head count would remain “roughly flat” through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, laid off 20% of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October, has slashed the company’s workforce by more than half.
Salesforce’s sales grew by 14% in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, such as Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce’s co-chief executive, announced he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month. In December, Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, also said he would leave his position by the end of this month. Salesforce bought Slack for $27.7 billion in 2020.
Salesforce is the largest private employer in San Francisco, and its flagship office building is the city’s tallest.
The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made “over the coming weeks,” he wrote.
Salesforce’s shares rose more than 3% in trading on Wednesday. The company’s stock price fell nearly 50% last year. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Union Wins Recognition At a Microsoft Company: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The outcome, involving about 300 employees, is one of organized labor's biggest victories at a major U.S. tech company.
Organized labor claimed one of its biggest victories at a U.S. tech company on Tuesday, gaining a foothold among about 300 employees at a video game maker owned by Microsoft.
The Communications Workers of America, which will represent the employees, announced the result, and Microsoft issued a statement recognizing the outcome.
"We look forward to engaging in good faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement," the company said. Microsoft has no other unionized workers.
The unionization move at the video game maker, ZeniMax Media, which Microsoft acquired for about $ 7.5 billion in a deal that closed in 2021, did not involve a conventional union election run by the National Labor Relations Board.
Instead, the company allowed workers to express their preferences in two ways: They could sign a union authorization card, which some began doing in November, or they could vote anonymously through an online platform that was open during most of December.
The process was more efficient and less contentious than the run-up to a typical labor board election, which can involve extensive legal wrangling.
Microsoft agreed to remain neutral throughout the union campaign, avoiding the anti-union meetings and messaging that many companies engage in. The concessions came as the company has been trying to placate antitrust regulators who are scrutinizing its roughly $ 70 billion proposed acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard.
"This is an empowering victory that allows us to protect ourselves and each other in a way we never could without a union," Skylar Hinnant, a worker involved in the organizing campaign, said in a statement.
When workers at a vast Amazon warehouse on Staten Island pushed to organize last year, the company fought the effort aggressively. The union prevailed in April, but Amazon has challenged the results. Apple has also sought to persuade retail workers against unionizing, though workers at two stores have voted to do so.
ZeniMax employees involved in the campaign, which included only quality assurance, or Q.A., workers, said Microsoft's neutral stance came as a relief. "It was nothing short of an absolute gift," Autumn Mitchell, a worker active in the union effort, said during an interview last month.
In a further sign that unionization is gaining traction across the gaming industry, workers at a Boston studio owned by Activision announced last week that they had filed a petition to hold a union election.
Two other Activision studios have already voted to unionize -- one in Wisconsin and the other near Albany, N.Y. But unlike those studios, the proposed union at the Boston studio, known as Proletariat, includes a variety of workers, such as animators, designers and engineers, not just Q.A. workers. A formal union with broader membership would appear to be a first at a major U.S. game maker.
The Communications Workers of America represents workers at the two Activision studios that have already unionized and would represent the Boston-based workers.
At ZeniMax, which includes the high-profile Bethesda Game Studios, maker of such hits as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, workers said they hoped a union would improve their pay and hours. Q.A. testers and other workers in the industry have long complained that they must endure grueling stretches of work shortly before a title is released.
Microsoft has said it consults with employees to ensure they don't take on too much work.
Those seeking to unionize at ZeniMax also said that they hoped to change the company's approach to promoting workers and to assigning them more responsibility, which they said seemed arbitrary at times, and that they hoped to be able to negotiate more flexible policies on remote work.
In June, Microsoft announced a deal with the communications workers union in which it promised to stay neutral if any of Activision's U.S. employees sought to unionize after Microsoft acquired the company. The video game maker has about 7,000 U.S. employees, most of whom are eligible to unionize.
Officially, the labor deal applied only to employees who joined Microsoft through the Activision purchase. But the tech giant indicated that it would be open to extending the terms of the labor deal to current employees as well.
The politically powerful communications workers union had voiced reservations about Microsoft's acquisition of Activision, but it said the neutrality agreement addressed its concerns, and the union's president later met with the chair of the Federal Trade Commission to urge support for the deal.
But regulators have not been appeased. The agency filed suit to block the Activision transaction in December, just as ZeniMax workers were deciding whether to unionize.

ESPN Put Game Aside To Focus On the News: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The question everyone wanted to know, including those at the sports network: What had happened to Damar Hamlin, and would he be OK?
It was 8:55 p.m., the early stages of a hotly anticipated National Football League game, when it seemed as though a run-of-the-mill injury had interrupted the game.
"Another Bills player down," said Joe Buck, the ESPN "Monday Night Football" announcer, not quite sure yet who was on the ground.
Mr. Buck soon realized the situation was far more dire. A replay showed that the Buffalo player, Damar Hamlin, had briefly stood up after the tackle and then collapsed, his body going motionless.
"We've all seen players go down," Mr. Buck said in an interview on Tuesday. "We've seen players get up and then go down. But it was jarring to see the way he fell after he stood up."
Within minutes, ESPN transformed from being a broadcaster of a football game to being at the center of a major and unexpected breaking news event. The question everyone wanted to know, including those at the sports network: What had happened to Mr. Hamlin, and would he be OK?
Several hours later, the Bills announced that Mr. Hamlin, 24, had gone into cardiac arrest after he tackled a Cincinnati Bengals receiver. On Tuesday, the team said he remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit at a Cincinnati hospital.
But in those early minutes, with millions watching and little information available, Mr. Buck was left trying to explain a possible life-or-death situation on live TV. He could see things had taken a terrible turn, and medical personnel were suddenly performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Mr. Hamlin. Mr. Buck knew little more than that, though.
"It was a nightmare," he said. "It certainly was nothing that anyone is ever prepared for. You have all that hype and buildup and everyone can't wait to watch this matchup, and in the snap of a finger it's completely different. Football just goes out the window."
For the next few hours, ESPN's coverage of Mr. Hamlin would bounce to and from the broadcast booth, the field at the Bengals' stadium, a nearby hospital, and studios in New York and Washington. On Monday night, ESPN suddenly looked like an episode of "Nightline" or a late hour on CNN, during a major breaking news story.
The network was cautious: There were few replays; there was little speculation about Mr. Hamlin's health. Lisa Salters, the "Monday Night Football" sideline reporter, relayed only what she had seen: the Bills and Bengals coaches meeting and talking, players walking in and out of the locker rooms.
Not long after Mr. Hamlin collapsed, Mr. Buck pointed out that players on the field had been told they had five minutes to warm up and prepare to return to playing. ESPN's footage showed the Bengals' quarterback, Joe Burrow, making tosses. In a late-night news conference, the N.F.L. denied that it had considered restarting the game.
Mr. Buck said the five-minute warm-up information had come from John Parry, ESPN's N.F.L. officiating analyst, "who is in an open line of communication with the league office in New York."
"It is our obligation to give the information we are provided by the N.F.L. in real time as we get it," Mr. Buck said. "That's our job at that time. That's all we can go with."
On Tuesday afternoon, the network said that there had been constant communication with the league and that "we reported what we were told in the moment."
"This was an unprecedented, rapidly evolving circumstance," the network continued. "All night long, we refrained from speculation."
About an hour after Mr. Hamlin fell to the ground, the "SportsCenter" anchor Scott Van Pelt took over the coverage from a studio in Washington, where the analyst Ryan Clark, a former N.F.L. player, joined him. From there, Mr. Van Pelt interviewed reporters who were at the hospital, as well as Ms. Salters from the field and Mr. Buck from the booth.
ESPN's coverage showed the benefits of having a newsroom and analysts it can deploy when there is a stunning turn of events. The N.F.L. is beginning to strike deals with tech companies -- YouTube just got the league's Sunday Ticket package, and Amazon has "Thursday Night Football" -- that don't have those resources to fall back on.
In the broadcast booth, Mr. Buck received text messages from friends and family asking him what was happening on the field -- perhaps there was something he knew that he couldn't share on the air?
"I have absolutely no information," Mr. Buck recalled saying. "All I can tell you is it's serious and what I'm witnessing I've never seen before."

Organized labor claimed one of its biggest victories at a U.S. tech company on Tuesday, gaining a foothold among about 300 employees at a video game maker owned by Microsoft.
The Communications Workers of America, which will represent the employees, announced the result, and Microsoft issued a statement recognizing the outcome.
“We look forward to engaging in good faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement,” the company said. Microsoft has no other unionized workers.
The unionization move at the video game maker, ZeniMax Media, which Microsoft acquired for about $7.5 billion in a deal that closed in 2021, did not involve a conventional union election run by the National Labor Relations Board.
Instead, the company allowed workers to express their preferences in two ways: They could sign a union authorization card, which some began doing in November, or they could vote anonymously through an online platform that was open during most of December.
The process was more efficient and less contentious than the run-up to a typical labor board election, which can involve extensive legal wrangling.
Microsoft agreed to remain neutral throughout the union campaign, avoiding the anti-union meetings and messaging that many companies engage in. The concessions came as the company has been trying to placate antitrust regulators who are scrutinizing its roughly $70 billion proposed acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard.
“This is an empowering victory that allows us to protect ourselves and each other in a way we never could without a union,” Skylar Hinnant, a worker involved in the organizing campaign, said in a statement.
When workers at a vast Amazon warehouse on New York’s Staten Island pushed to organize last year, the company fought the effort aggressively. The union prevailed in April, but Amazon has challenged the results. Apple has also sought to persuade retail workers against unionizing, although workers at two stores have voted to do so.
ZeniMax employees involved in the campaign, which included only quality assurance workers, said Microsoft’s neutral stance came as a relief. “It was nothing short of an absolute gift,” Autumn Mitchell, a worker active in the union effort, said during an interview last month.
In a further sign that unionization is gaining traction across the gaming industry, workers at a Boston studio owned by Activision announced last week that they had filed a petition to hold a union election.
Two other Activision studios have already voted to unionize — one in Wisconsin and the other near Albany, New York. But unlike those studios, the proposed union at the Boston studio, known as Proletariat, includes a variety of workers, such as animators, designers and engineers, not just quality assurance workers. A formal union with broader membership would appear to be a first at a major U.S. game maker.
The Communications Workers of America represents workers at the two Activision studios that have already unionized and would represent the Boston-based workers.
At ZeniMax, which includes the high-profile Bethesda Game Studios, maker of such hits as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, workers said they hoped a union would improve their pay and hours. Quality assurance testers and other workers in the industry have long complained that they must endure grueling stretches of work shortly before a title is released.
Microsoft has said it consults with employees to ensure they don’t take on too much work.
Those seeking to unionize at ZeniMax also said that they hoped to change the company’s approach to promoting workers and to assigning them more responsibility, which they said seemed arbitrary at times, and that they hoped to be able to negotiate more flexible policies on remote work.
In June, Microsoft announced a deal with the communications workers union in which it promised to stay neutral if any of Activision’s U.S. employees sought to unionize after Microsoft acquired the company. The video game maker has about 7,000 U.S. employees, most of whom are eligible to unionize.
Officially, the labor deal applied only to employees who joined Microsoft through the Activision purchase. But the tech giant indicated that it would be open to extending the terms of the labor deal to current employees as well.
The politically powerful communications workers union had voiced reservations about Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, but it said the neutrality agreement addressed its concerns, and the union’s president later met with the chair of the Federal Trade Commission to urge support for the deal.
But regulators have not been appeased. The agency filed suit to block the Activision transaction in December, just as ZeniMax workers were deciding whether to unionize. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Numbers in the News

NUMBERS THAT COUNT
2
The number of major central banks — the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China — that didn’t raise interest rates last year, even as inflation threatened global economic growth and sapped consumer purchasing power. Central banks have collectively increased rates by more than 70% in 2022, according to LPL Financial, with the same goal: raise borrowing costs to cool rising prices that have been hitting shoppers from London to Poughkeepsie. Many were following the Fed, which increased its prime lending rate to a target range of 4.25% to 4.5% from roughly zero a year ago. The effect: stocks and bonds slumped on concerns that the increases would slow the economy.
44 billion
The value in dollars of Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter, backed by about $12.5 billion of debt that investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, took on to help finance the acquisition. The banks made the promise before technology sector shares crashed, the billionaire tried to walk away from the acquisition, and the market for leveraged loans seized up. Unable to sell that debt without incurring huge losses, the banks head into the new year saddled with loans that will constrain their ability to finance more deals.
Musk’s management of Twitter has been erratic: He has fired workers, refused to pay invoices, changed content moderation policies, allowed banned users back on to the platform, temporarily suspended some journalists’ accounts, been accused of neglecting his other companies and said he would resign as CEO (eventually). But his style has won admiration among many tech executives, founders and investors.
90 million
The number of vacant properties in China as of late summer. The world’s second-largest economy was hammered last year, and a sharp slowdown in the crucial property sector was one big reason. Real estate development accounted for about one-quarter of China’s gross domestic product over the past decade, but a squeeze on the industry caused seemingly impregnable companies to teeter and prompted rare social unrest among unhappy property owners. The lingering challenges facing the debt-fueled housing industry point to structural questions that still hang over the economy.
151,000
The number of layoffs in the tech sector, according to Layoffs.fyi. Job cuts at companies including Amazon, Meta, Twitter and Stripe have dominated headlines in recent months, as Silicon Valley faces pressure to downsize. The shift is partly a post-pandemic correction. Companies hired aggressively (perhaps too aggressively) when demand for services boomed as consumers were stuck at home. But as the broader economy slowed in the latter half of the year, companies have been squeezed and tech stocks have plummeted.
4.9 million
The number of jobs created in the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor market is confounding economists. Ordinarily, when economic growth falters, hiring slows down, too (example A: the tech sector). Job growth is ticking lower, but employers are continuing to hire, keeping the unemployment rate a relatively strong 3.7%. That’s good news for workers, but it may force the Fed to double down on aggressive rate increases in the first half of 2023.
51 billion
The cost in euros of Germany’s bailout of Uniper, once Europe’s biggest importer of Russian gas. The utility company was decimated last year as energy prices soared. The business was hit particularly hard after Gazprom, the Russian energy company that was its biggest supplier, cut gas flows in apparent retaliation for economic sanctions on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. Uniper posted a net loss of 40 billion euros, or about $42.5 billion — the biggest in German corporate history — for the first nine months of 2022. The government nationalized the company to avoid a Lehman Brothers-style effect on the energy sector.
14
The number of consecutive quarters Apple has grown — a streak that is now at risk. The tech giant last reported a year-on-year quarterly decline in 2019, but the punishing impact of China’s “zero-COVID” policy on supply chains and consumer spending in one of its biggest markets now poses a big threat. Apple produces more than 95% of its iPhones in China and warned in November that it would ship fewer of its newest models after a COVID outbreak and weekslong lockdown at the device’s biggest manufacturing hub. That could have hit sales in the crucial holiday quarter.
8 billion
The amount in dollars of the shortfall in FTX’s accounts when the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried declared bankruptcy in November. The company, once seen as one of the most stable in the sector, could owe money to more than 1 million people and organizations. Bankman-Fried was once lauded as an industry leader, able to secure funding from top investors who backed a wide range of causes and businesses, from charities and politicians to sports and the news media. But he is now under criminal investigation, former top associates are cooperating with authorities and FTX has been called “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.”
11 years and three months
The length of time that Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the blood-testing startup Theranos, was sentenced to prison after being convicted of defrauding investors. (Ramesh Balwani, the company’s former chief operating officer, was sentenced to nearly 13 years.) Holmes raised $945 million and her company was valued as high as $9 billion, turning her into one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated entrepreneurs. But her claims that Theranos’ technology would enable tests to be conducted with just a few drops of blood proved untrue.
747
Boeing produced its final humpbacked jumbo jet on Dec. 6. The industry’s push for more fuel-efficient planes and the pandemic proved the death knell for the onetime titan of the skies. The plane made its first commercial flight in January 1970. By being able to carry hundreds of passengers at a time, the 747 helped drive a boom in international travel. But its market share fell in recent years, as airlines shifted to more-sustainable and less-expensive aircraft. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Zoey Deutch Appreciates Life's Simple Joys: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actor, now in the movie "Something From Tiffany's," thrives on regular readings of "Our Town," discussions of "Sapiens" and whiffs of her dog's paws.
Zoey Deutch wanted to be honest. "Rarely am I drawn to super joyful material," she said. "I have, at least in the last couple of years, been interested in darker, tonally strange pieces."
An influencer who fakes surviving a terrorist attack in "Not Okay." An F.B.I. informant in "The Outfit."
But four years ago, she recalled, Reese Witherspoon tweeted that she'd seen and loved Deutch in "Set It Up," about a couple of overworked assistants who try to create some breathing room by getting their bosses together.
The two women started talking, which resulted in Melissa Hill's novel "Something From Tiffany's" being sent to Deutch. That led to their collaboration on the Amazon Prime Video adaptation (Witherspoon as a producer, Deutch as the star and an executive producer) about mixed-up Tiffany's bags, a zingy New York baker (Deutch) stunned by an engagement ring from the boyfriend she's not sure about, and a captivating widower (Kendrick Sampson) whose proposal is sabotaged when his girlfriend opens her own blue box -- and the ring isn't there.
Rarely has so much bread been consumed onscreen in pursuit of diamonds and love.
"So now we get to share our great, feel-good romantic movie," Deutch said, not sounding remotely dark on a video call from her home in Los Angeles, before elaborating on the deliciousness of her dog's paws, the significance of her grandmother's paintings and the lessons to be found in Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
1. "The Book of Symbols" It was brought into my life by my Alexander technique teacher many years ago when I was preparing for a movie. One of the reasons he gave it to me is because when we're working on a new character or a new project, we like to pick animals and colors and symbols and create a visual board for the character. This became sort of a guiding light. I have a million copies downstairs because I always give them to people.
2. Farmers' Markets I went to an acupuncturist once who said something that stuck with me: that it's so important, especially in this day and age when we get our groceries sent to our house, to go to the grocery store or to the farmers' market and look at the food, because we are going further and further and further away from our instincts. And we have great instincts about what our bodies need if we listen to them. The more I started to grow and pick out my own food, the more I realized that things looked good to me not just because they were necessarily pretty, but because my body was craving them and needed those specific nutrients.
3. My Dog's Paws You know that specific smell of dogs' paws when they're asleep? They smell like corn chips, like Fritos. It's actually a thing. They have some sort of bacteria in their paws and the odor smells similar to corn chips and it's released when they're asleep.
4. "The Joy of Cooking" The basics in there are really fantastic. I put my own spin on things, but I always go back to that roast chicken recipe with just butter and salt.
5. Grandma's Paintings My grandma was an amazing, prolific artist and a spiritual, eccentric woman. She has inspired me in every way, and I carry her with me always. Specifically, I carry with me a painting I have above my fireplace that I designed my whole house around. She painted a lot of abstract stuff, but oddly this one is a naked woman on a red background. It feels right to be able to see her work every day.
6. "Our Town" I prefer reading plays to books or scripts. It's very soothing for me. I read "Our Town" for the first time when I was 14 or 15, and I've read it every two years since. It's just a heartbreaking, beautiful story that gets me every time. It's about how little we appreciate the simple joys of life and don't understand the value of life while we're living it.
7. Ceramics My love of ceramics began with my great-grandmother, who had a small box of Atomic Starburst, a dinnerware that's kind of famous. I saw that in my mom's garage and I loved them. Then I started collecting them and now I have a whole set. I think the hunt is very fun, with that one specifically, because I know exactly what I'm looking for. And I have started collecting ceramics in Ischia, in Ravello, in Oaxaca.
8. "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari The way he explains things works for my brain. It's like the intersection between natural sciences and social sciences. It's very stimulating. It's also very fun to discuss -- dinner-table conversations that are very, like, "Whoa, I never thought about it that way."
9. Matching Tracksuits As a little girl I had aspirations of both being an actress and a fashion designer. So it sounds a little counterintuitive to say I love matching tracksuits, which are essentially just pajamas that you wear out. But after spending half of my life in fittings for jobs or events or whatever, the last thing I want to do is try on clothes. I just want to be comfortable.
10. Adventure My parents worked so hard when we were growing up and didn't really take a lot of time for themselves. And what happened as a result is I became obsessed with traveling and planning and doing things and enjoying the fruits of my labor and experiencing the world and having a really full life. It's hard not to feel guilty because I have the part of my brain that's like, "Work all the time." And then I have to go to the other part of my brain, which is, "Enjoy your life." I'm trying to reframe my American mind-set of live to work, not work to live. In the spirit of "Our Town," you never know how good it is until it's gone.
