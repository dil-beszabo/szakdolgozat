Full text: The move by France's richest man extends a carefully planned succession strategy for the world's biggest luxury company.
Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods empire, announced on Thursday that he had nominated two more of his children to sit on the company board, a move to cement his family's control of Europe's most valuable conglomerate.
Those appointments, subject to the approval of a 15-person board, essentially lock in four of Mr. Arnault's five children as the chief decision makers of the company, furthering a succession strategy that Mr. Arnault, France's richest man, has meticulously mapped for years in a bid to extend LVMH's legacy into the next generation.
Mr. Arnault, 74, made the announcement as he shared LVMH's 2023 financial results. Despite economic slowdowns in Europe, the United States and China, the company's biggest markets, sales for the year were up 9 percent, to 86.2 billion euros, or $ 94 billion. Net profit rose 8 percent to €15.2 billion -- a record for the company.
"Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our brands and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges," Mr. Arnault said. Sales were driven by clothing and leather goods, as well as perfumes, cosmetics, watches and jewelry.
Mr. Arnault nominated Alexandre Arnault, 31, who is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Company, and Frédéric Arnault, 29, chief executive of Tag Heuer. They would join two older siblings: Delphine, 48, who is also chairman and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture, and Antoine, 46, who runs multiple LVMH brands and is in charge of the group's image and sustainability efforts. The youngest sibling, Jean, 25, is Louis Vuitton's watch director.
"As I have always said, LVMH is a family-run group," Mr. Arnault said in a statement. He said the two brothers "will each bring interesting perspectives."
Over three decades, Mr. Arnault has forged LVMH into the world's largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France. Its brands -- 75 of them -- are the stars of the luxury world and include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom Pérignon Champagne.
Mr. Arnault has long worked to ensure that the conglomerate -- which he created by acquiring European luxury brands that had been weakened by the families that owned them -- will stay firmly in his own family's hands. He persuaded the board in 2022 to raise the mandatory retirement age for the chief executive and chairman to 80, from 75, and created a corporate structure that ensured that his children -- each of whom has executive roles in the company -- would remain the top decision makers.
Such moves have ignited speculation of competition among the siblings over who will one day succeed their father. Mr. Arnault brushed off such talk in an interview last summer with The New York Times, saying: "The best person inside the family or outside the family should be, one day, my successor. But it's not something that I hope is a duel for the near future."
In 2022, Forbes named Mr. Arnault the world's richest man, a perch he lost when LVMH's share price slumped around 20 percent amid weakening growth in the demand for luxury goods. He now holds the title of the second-richest person in the world, according to Forbes, eclipsed by Elon Musk.
Last year, LVMH was also toppled as Europe's most valuable company by Denmark's Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical firm that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, the popular drugs being used for weight loss.

In Connecticut, Mayor Wins Primary Months After Winning General Election: [National Desk]

Full text: A judge ordered Bridgeport, Conn., to rerun its Democratic primary for mayor after videos of ballot stuffing surfaced. But first, the city held a general election.
Joe Ganim, the longtime mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., won the city's Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday -- months after winning the general election and an earlier primary.
The Associated Press called the race in Mr. Ganim's favor shortly before midnight. With nearly all of the votes counted, Mr. Ganim was ahead of his challenger, John Gomes, 55.9 percent to 44.1 percent.
The results followed a strange and protracted election season in Connecticut's largest city, caused by a ballot-fraud scandal.
In the initial Democratic primary, held last September, Mayor Ganim beat Mr. Gomes by 251 votes. But a judge voided the results in November after videos surfaced showing the mayor's supporters making repeated trips to drop boxes and stuffing them with wads of absentee ballots.
The volume of mishandled ballots "calls the result of the primary election into serious doubt," the judge, William Clark, wrote in his decision.
Judge Clark ordered that a new primary be held but said he did not have the authority to halt the general election, which was held days after his ruling.
Mayor Ganim won the general election; Mr. Gomes came in second, running as an independent. But the mayor was not sworn in.
A new general election has now been scheduled for Feb. 27.
Mayor Ganim projected optimism about the primary results early Tuesday evening, even when only a small number of votes had been counted.
Taking the stage at his campaign party in a bar in downtown Bridgeport before 9 p.m., Mr. Ganim thanked "thousands and thousands" of the city's residents, whom he described as voting "overwhelmingly" for him.
Mr. Gomes said early on Tuesday that he would not participate in the new general election as an independent candidate if Mayor Ganim won the do-over Democratic primary. By Tuesday night, however, he said he might change his mind.
"We're not 100 percent satisfied with the results coming in," Mr. Gomes said.
Even as the polls reopened this week for the new primary, Mr. Ganim and Mr. Gomes traded fresh accusations of election skulduggery.
"Yesterday we reported that a voter's ballot was mailed a week after she died," Mr. Gomes said on Tuesday morning. "We filed a lawsuit against them because they stole an election."
In response, Mr. Ganim said that the Gomes campaign had obtained applications for absentee primary ballots "and handed them out like candy."
The Connecticut secretary of state's office had stationed two election monitors for the past 30 days in Bridgeport, where they watched video footage of activity around ballot drop boxes and made hundreds of spot-check calls to absentee voters.
The monitors referred seven cases of possible election interference to the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which has the power to investigate.
"I had received reports that people were afraid of intimidation, coercion," Stephanie Thomas, the secretary of state, said at a news conference.
For Election Day, the office recruited more than a dozen lawyers and election law experts to volunteer at polling locations in Bridgeport.
The bickering and accusations of election tampering have caused many residents to tune out politics. In a city of 150,000, only 8,173 people voted in the primary last fall.
"It's hard to trust when the trust has been broken so many times," said Nicole Smickle, 37, a home health aide who voted Tuesday for Mr. Ganim.
Bridgeport has long been plagued by accusations of election irregularities, particularly the mishandling of absentee ballots by supporters of political candidates. In interviews and in court testimony, residents of the city's low-income housing complexes have described people sweeping through their apartment buildings, pressuring them to apply for absentee ballots they were not legally entitled to and sometimes even filling out the applications and returning the ballots for them -- all of which is illegal.
In June, the State Elections Enforcement Commission said there was evidence of possible criminality in the 2019 mayoral primary. In 2017, a judge ordered that a Democratic primary for City Council seats be rerun after a single absentee ballot, which was improperly handled, decided the race. And in 2022, a judge ordered a new Democratic primary in a state representative race over allegations of absentee ballot fraud.
"There's a huge cover-up that's been going on for multiple decades," said Jack Hennessy, the incumbent in the 2022 race, who lost. "There's a pattern here, year after year. It's only because of the videos that we're having this discussion."
Mayor Ganim -- who spent seven years in prison on federal corruption charges, then regained the mayor's post in 2015 -- has repeatedly lost the in-person vote but then swept his competition in votes cast by absentee ballot.
Ms. Thomas, the secretary of state, noted that the election season had been unusual.
"It's a little odd, obviously," she said. "But I think it was needed in this case to restore the faith of voters."

Reality Confronts A Fading Dynasty: [Review]

Full text: A once-powerful clan gathers for a family wedding and muddles through the facts and fiction of their past and present.
On a summer lawn outside Ballybeg Hall, the O'Donnell siblings loll under lemony sunlight perfect for a family reunion. A wedding has lured back two of the émigrés among them, but Claire, the bride-to-be, has always lived at home.
Her intended is a local man, decades older, whom she does not love. A widower with young children he wants her to raise, he has promised her a car for Christmas, and days full of nothing to do. None of which matches the dreams she once had of channeling her musical talent into a performing career.
"He's buying a piano so that I can teach the children to play," Claire says, the flatness of her voice the barest camouflage for her anguish. "Maybe one of them will become a concert pianist?"
This is what the wan remnants of an Irish Catholic dynasty look like in Brian Friel's play "Aristocrats," set in the mid-1970s amid the tumbledown glamour of the O'Donnells' grand old homestead, in the hills above Ballybeg, County Donegal.
Charlotte Moore's revival at Irish Repertory Theater, where she is the artistic director, is thwarted by a casting misstep; more on that shortly. Even so, this exquisitely knowing, distinctly Chekhovian play about lies and illusions handed down as history still has the power to grab us.
This generation of O'Donnells and the ones that came before it have habitually looked down on Ballybeg and its people. But the family's money has long since run out, and these grown siblings were not raised to fend for themselves.
In a sickbed upstairs, their father (Colin Lane) lies moaning and ranting, his once sharp legal mind ravaged by a stroke. Over a baby monitor in the study, we hear him muttering at Judith (Danielle Ryan), his exhausted daughter and constant caretaker, whom he no longer recognizes.
"Let me tell you something in confidence," he says, poisonously. "Judith betrayed the family."
"Did she?" Judith says mildly, as if it were nothing to hear this accusation -- an allusion, perhaps, to her fighting the police early in the Troubles, or to the child she bore out of wedlock, then placed in an orphanage. Maybe both.
The O'Donnells do not ordinarily deal in truths, preferring the romance of their own much-embroidered mythology. It speaks of a glorious past and utters not a whisper about matters like suicide, mental illness and conditional love. Let alone whomever Casimir (Tom Holcomb) -- sole brother to Judith, Claire (Meg Hennessy) and Alice (Sarah Street), a lonely alcoholic Londoner -- is really making a life with in Germany. An inveterate fabulist who remains terrified of his father, Casimir seems to have invented the wife and three children whom the family has never met.
This production, which is part of Irish Rep's season-long Friel Project, never does cohere, despite plenty of persuasive acting, including by Tim Ruddy as Alice's husband and Shane McNaughton as the working-class local who dotes on Judith. Charlie Corcoran's set and Michael Gottlieb's lighting are lovely.
Yet in a play that is so much about culture and place, our suspension of disbelief is shattered repeatedly by the garrulous Casimir sounding like he is straight out of the American Midwest, his Irish accent disappearing for nearly the entire performance I saw.
As the O'Donnells well know, make-believe requires collusion. But there are some pretenses we cannot will ourselves to buy.

Louis Vuitton Returns to Sailing: [Style Desk]

Full text: The luxury brand will sponsor the prestigious America's Cup yacht race in 2024 -- the same year it sponsors the Olympics.
Louis Vuitton's takeover of the sporting world continues apace: Next August, shortly after the LVMH-sponsored Summer Olympic Games end in Paris, the Louis Vuitton-sponsored America's Cup will begin in Barcelona.
America's Cup, the world's most prestigious sailing yacht competition, was last sponsored by Louis Vuitton in 2017. Since 1983, the fashion brand had also sponsored the Louis Vuitton Cup, a competition that determines who competes in America's Cup. (There are only two racing teams in America's Cup: the defending champions and the challenger who wins the Louis Vuitton Cup.)
After 2017, though, the Italian fashion house Prada became the race's main sponsor -- and the Louis Vuitton Cup became the Prada Cup.
Louis Vuitton did not comment on why it made the decision to come back or, seven years ago, to leave the competitive sailing world. In a news release, Pietro Beccari, the chairman and chief executive of the company, referred only to an "immense sense of pride" in returning to the competition as title partner.
Grant Dalton, the chief executive of America's Cup, pointed to the endurance of each organization: The America's Cup began in 1851; Louis Vuitton was founded in 1854. "It just feels completely natural that they're back in the game," he said.
Mr. Dalton hopes that reuniting with Louis Vuitton will bring more recognition to the niche sport, particularly among younger consumers. "They instantly make it easier for us to attract more sponsors," said Mr. Dalton, who referred to the alliance as a "very, very easy marriage." The Barcelona contest will take place between August and October in 2024.
For Louis Vuitton, the partnership is part of a much wider initiative in the world of sports. In recent years the company has created trunks to enclose the trophies of several major sporting events, including the World Cup, the NBA Finals, the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco and the Rugby World Cup. As part of its sponsorship of the America's Cup and Louis Vuitton Cup, it will provide trophy trunks, too.
In July, the parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced its sponsorship deal with the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which will support a number of individual athletes, including the French swimmer Léon Marchand, the gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos and the fencer Enzo Lefort.
"The partnership will help promote France throughout the world," Bernard Arnault, the head of the conglomerate, said.
But the group's affinity for sports stretches far beyond France. Louis Vuitton's star ambassadors include Carlos Alcaraz, the Spanish tennis player who modeled in a men's formal wear campaign for Louis Vuitton in August, and Eileen Gu, a Chinese American skier who walked in the brand's 2023 cruise runway show.
Mr. Dalton, a New Zealand sailor who will be overseeing the competition in Barcelona -- the Emirates Team New Zealand team is the reigning America's Cup champion -- said that "the cup is the top of the food chain in our sport. And Louis Vuitton is on top of the fashion industry in the same way. There's no doubt about that."

I Don't Have to Tweet About My Outrage. Neither Do You.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I am neither Jewish nor Palestinian, and none of my six regular gigs have anything to do with foreign policy, but the other day I opened Twitter (now called X) after some time offline to find people I don't know demanding that I make a public statement about what's happening in the Middle East. It seemed that most of the people on social media had made a statement, including various corporate brands, celebrities and miscellaneous lifestyle influencers. American Eagle's chief marketing officer posted to LinkedIn that the company had changed its Times Square billboard to an image of the Israeli flag. "Praying for Israel," Justin Bieber posted on Instagram, over an image (later deleted) of what was actually Gaza.
But not everyone was taking a side. As I scrolled through my timeline, I saw lots of random citizens being told that if they didn't speak out, they, too, would have blood on their hands.
People speaking from both the right and the left seemed to attribute my silence to depraved indifference to human suffering, though they were divided on which humans were suffering. As it happens, I had been dealing with shingles (zero stars, do not recommend) and the depression I struggle with periodically. I was tired and overwhelmed, as are a great many other people. But the voices yelling at me and anyone else who failed to post seemed to believe that not making a statement was itself a statement -- and an immoral one, at that.
There's a facile version of taking a stand on social media that generates righteous back patting but reduces complex issues to a simple yes or no. Taking simplistic stands can also lead to twisting words. Concern for Palestinians is portrayed as support for Hamas or hatred toward Israel or Jews in general. Anger about Hamas's deadly attacks on Israeli citizens -- or any mention of antisemitism -- is portrayed as denigrating the dignity of all Palestinian lives. This kind of thinking is deeply unserious and further fuels hostilities, warping nuanced positions into extremism and mistaking tweet-length expressions of outrage for brave action in the face of atrocity.
When institutions offered statements that expressed sorrow for the loss of both Israeli and Palestinian lives, some constituents and customers demanded a revision that explicitly condemned their preferred villain. If these institutional voices stayed silent, it was considered newsworthy. "Six days after Hamas's horrific terror attacks on Israel," a reporter at Women's Wear Daily wrote last Thursday, "many major players in the beauty -- and overall fashion -- industry have remained largely silent in support of the victims on both sides of the conflict." Did we really need or want to hear from L'Oréal or LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton?
The impulse toward loud, reductive declarations reflects genuine fear about horrors that lie beyond words. Simple binaries imply simple solutions. And it's much more pleasant to tell yourself you stand on the side of good, against evil, than to question whether the lines of demarcation were drawn correctly.
Sitting with uncertainty is hard, especially when social media has primed us to expect perfect real-time information during traumatic events and to want instantaneous answers and resolution. Moral certainty is an anchor we cling to when factual certainty is not possible. And the faster we express it, the more certain we appear. The most righteous among us post -- and do it immediately.
Knee-jerk social media posts are not what bother me most, though. Instead, it's the idea that not posting is wrong somehow -- that everyone needs to speak, all the time. It discourages shutting up and listening and letting the voices that matter the most be heard over the din. It implies it's not OK to have any uncertainty about what's going on or any kind of moral analysis that does not lend itself to presentation in a social media post. It does not leave time or space for people to process traumatic events in the sanctuary of their own minds or to gather more information before pronouncing a judgment. It pressures people who don't have an opinion yet or are working out what they think to manufacture one and present it to a jury of total strangers on the internet who will render an instant verdict on its propriety.
I do have opinions, of course, but they don't fit in a tweet (and would be extremely awkward on TikTok). I think Hamas is a terrorist group and Israel has a right to defend itself. I lived in Manhattan on Sept. 11, and even so, I can't imagine the grief and terror Jewish people feel right now in the face of continued attacks and rising antisemitism globally. I also think that the Israeli state should not be allowed to conflate Hamas with Gaza or to cut off electricity and access to food and medical supplies to civilians who are trapped in Gaza or to justify those acts by claiming that Palestinians who live there -- about half of whom are children -- can just leave when they plainly can't. If the destruction of Gaza is not the goal, it is a very real possibility, and that should be equally unacceptable.
Are these opinions helpful? Useful? Interesting? And if so, to whom?
I'm not a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, but a passage in the book "Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions" seems applicable here. "Nothing pays off like restraint of tongue and pen," writes A.A.'s co-founder Bill Wilson. "We must avoid quick-tempered criticism and furious, power-driven arguments," which he calls "emotional booby traps baited with pride and vengefulness." I'll admit I have posted on social media from a place of pride and vengeance, and as a writer, I'm perhaps less conditioned to practice restraint of pen and avoidance of arguments. But thoughtful criticism is my goal, and while I've regretted posting half-formed thoughts too quickly, I've never regretted waiting until I was less angry or not posting at all.
In an environment where people are led to believe they should post or blurt out simplistic opinions, they will, for fear that others will think they're not informed enough, they don't care enough or their moral compass has been demagnetized. But a reactionary social media post tells you nothing about what they really think or know, cheapens the discourse and impedes progress. It's sloganeering masquerading as moral clarity.

Full text: Pharrell, Thom Browne and Linda Evangelista are all contributing to a starry season for fashion publishing.
It is fashion month, that season when a certain crowd jets between catwalks in New York, London, Milan and Paris. Once everyone is cozily back at home, what better coda than a book -- or two -- from the bounty of fashion titles adding a little coolness to the fall publishing schedule?
Below, 12 new releases that have generated excitement among the staff of the Styles desk. They swing between subtle and splashy; experimental and reflective; quick reads and deep dives. Any one would make a stylish (or should we say Styles-ish?) addition to your coffee table or reading list.
Most Playful: I Care a Lotta, I Wear Collina Strada
Collina Strada's environmentally-conscious absurdism is on display in a book that intersperses collages of aliens with advice on composting.
Most Star Power: Linda Evangelista Photographed by Steven Meisel
Those who pored over Vogue's September issue featuring four of the original supermodels will also lap up this compendium of Steven Meisel's photographs. Come for the cheekbones, stay for a rumination on the relationship between artist and muse.
Most Air: Fly: The Big Book of Basketball Fashion
The Pulitzer Prize winner Mitchell S. Jackson examines the oversize suits, chains, sneakers and T-shirts that helped basketball style take off. Sneakerheads may also appreciate "A History of Basketball in Fifteen Sneakers" by Russ Bengtson.
Most Monochromatic: Thom Browne: The 20th Anniversary Book
Thom Browne's first book, which celebrates the subversive suiting for which he is known, would pair well with a shorts suit and a Hector bag.
Most Overdue: Ann Lowe: American Couturier
Elizabeth Way has compiled an appreciation of Ann Lowe, the Black designer who made Jackie Kennedy's wedding dress and many other gowns for New York's upper crust.
Most Encyclopedic: Shoes A-Z: The Collection of the Museum at FIT
This collection of more than 400 pairs of shoes -- Manolos, Louboutins -- can be enjoyed without giving up an inch of one's shoe rack.
Most Bling: Pharrell: Carbon, Pressure & Time: A Book of Jewels
Before he was the creative director for men's wear at Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams decked out hip-hop stars (including himself) with jewelry. This book may be as close as you will get to trying any of it on.
Most Creative Use of WFH: Carolina Herrera: Colormania: Color and Fashion
Wes Gordon, who is the designer of Carolina Herrera, and Elizaveta Porodina, a photographer, began work in 2020 on this series, which includes images captured over Zoom.
Most Metallic: Yves Saint Laurent: Gold
"It's the color of the sun," said Yves Saint Laurent, whose preoccupation with the precious metal was the subject of an exhibition in Paris last year and, now, a book. Those looking for more specific prescriptions from the designer might also consider "The World According to Yves Saint Laurent," a book of maxims being published this fall.
Most Musical: Fashion Killa: How Hip-Hop Revolutionized High Fashion
To coincide with the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, Sowmya Krishnamurthy examines the hip-hop tastemakers who fought their way into an exclusionary luxury industry.
Most Front-Row Access: Givenchy: The Complete Collections
This collection of catwalk images from Givenchy shows is certain to appeal to the friend who just bought out the Uniqlo Clare Waight Keller collection (Ms. Keller was a former designer of Givenchy). It also includes designs by John Galliano, Matthew M. Williams and Alexander McQueen.
Doing the Most: More Rick Owens
In a continuation of his first volume of photographs, the designer Rick Owens teams up with the photographer Danielle Levitt to delight in provocation. Prepare for louche poses and leather, daring silhouettes and spikes.

A Grown-Up Slumber Party: [Style Desk]

Full text: To mark the opening of her latest hospitality project, Estelle Manor, Eiesha Bharti Pasricha hosted a celebration of female friendship and ingenuity.
For Eiesha Bharti Pasricha, the artistic director of the London members' club Maison Estelle, entertaining is sacrosanct. Growing up in an Indian family in New Delhi -- her father is the businessman Sunil Bharti Mittal -- she understood early on that hospitality was not just a nicety but a cultural value to be upheld. "Hosting is the way we express our care," says Bharti Pasricha, 39, who is known among her friends for organizing frequent dinners at her home in London's Notting Hill neighborhood. "My grandmother always used to say, 'Your guest is God."'
Bharti Pasricha's commitment to that ethos is, in part, why her husband, Sharan Pasricha, 42 -- the co-chief executive officer and founder of the hospitality firm Ennismore, which is behind hotels including Gleneagles in Scotland and those of the Hoxton chain -- brought her on as a collaborator for two of his company's recent projects. In addition to co-founding Maison Estelle, a luxurious but unstuffy hideaway in a Georgian townhouse, Bharti Pasricha oversaw every detail in the creation of its rural counterpart, Estelle Manor, a 108-room, four-restaurant hotel in Oxfordshire that opened in May.
Though the property's main building, a limestone neo-Jacobean mansion set on 60 acres of park and woodland, is undeniably grand, the couple have infused it with warmth. The interiors, conceived in part by the design studio Roman and Williams, are colorful and inviting, layered with verdure tapestries and antique furniture upholstered in offbeat jewel-toned textiles. And though some spaces on the property are reserved for members, you don't need to be one to book a room.
A similar spirit of welcome was in evidence on a warm evening in September when Bharti Pasricha assembled a group of female friends for dinner and a night at the hotel, to celebrate the culmination of the project, which had been more than five years in the making. For the special meal, her first time hosting at the estate, she chose a wild-card format, asking each of her initial 20 guests to bring along a woman who inspires them. The result was an exuberant gathering of 40-plus childhood friends, family members and creative collaborators that felt something like a very grown-up sleepover.
After meeting for Champagne on the hotel's south terrace, overlooking the property's swimming pool -- which is surrounded by Italian Riviera-style striped umbrellas -- the group made its way to the walled garden, where dinner was served at a long table in the greenhouse, surrounded by aloe, senecio and yucca plants. The mood was jubilant; the singer Lulu, 74, took selfies with her fellow partygoers and women sent cocktails to one another across the table. After midnight, the guests were taken by golf cart back to the main house, now lit up dramatically against the night sky, where drinks were served in the members-only bar until the gathering eventually disbanded around 2 a.m. "Do you know how many friendships were made last night?" asked Bharti Pasricha, smiling, at breakfast the next day. "There were connections sparking all over the place."
The attendees: Bharti Pasricha, whose guest of honor was her mother, Nyna Mittal, 63, invited 20 friends and their plus ones. Among the group were the Serbian-born, London-based fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic, 48, who arrived with her friend the Slovenian designer Lara Bohinc, 51; the French designer Julie de Libran, 51, who was joined by her sister and business partner, Fanélie Phillips, 54; the Italian hotelier Marie-Louise Sciò, 46, who was seated beside the British photographer Mary McCartney, 54, whose work "Gently Holding Frog" (1995) hangs in the hotel's members-only study; and the British musician Anoushka Shankar, 42, who invited the British television presenter Anita Rani, 45.
The table: For the décor, Bharti Pasricha took cues from the green hues of the surrounding countryside and from the event's kitchen garden-inspired menu, dressing the table with pale pistachio green linens and inviting the florist Katie Smyth, 37, of the East London-based studio Worm, to layer it with vegetables and flowers from the property's walled garden. She arranged hydrangeas, cosmos, Japanese anemones, sweet peas and dahlias among piles of artichokes, cabbages, plums and brussels sprouts to create a centerpiece that brought to mind one of the 16th-century Italian artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo's food-filled paintings.
The food: Prepared by the hotel's in-house chef, Ambra Papa, the meal began with seasonal crudités, including purple and white heritage carrots, sugar snap peas and cherry tomatoes, served with red pepper hummus. Next came sourdough bread with pickles and fennel pollen butter, and giant Orkney scallops cooked in their shells with basil and coriander gathered from the nearby potting shed. For the main course, roast chicken with cauliflower dressed in lemon and tahini was accompanied by a succession of sharing plates, which included green beans with olives and tomatoes, charred hispi cabbage with rose petal harissa and a staple of the hotel's Glasshouse restaurant -- cracked potatoes, made by steaming, crushing and frying potatoes with garlic, chiles, paprika and salt. Dessert was Bharti Pasricha's favorite: Eton mess, made with wild strawberries and basil syrup.
The drinks: After sipping Billecart-Salmon Champagne on the terrace, guests were served French wines -- Dominique Lafon Bourgogne Blanc 2020, Domaine des Mapliers rosé and Domaine Ghislaine Barthod Bourgogne Rouge 2020 -- with dinner. Later, in the members' bar, margaritas, made at Estelle Manor with Casamigos Blanco tequila, were passed around on silver trays.
The music: Early in the evening, two members of the Legends, a London-based quintet of Cuban musicians, played an acoustic set featuring Latin American standards such as "Candela" by the Buena Vista Social Club and Marc Anthony's "Vivir Mi Vida." "I wanted it to feel convivial and fun," says Bharti Pasricha.
The conversation: "There were no false pleasantries," says Bharti Pasricha of the table talk, which ranged from the guests' summer travels to maternity nurses to the international rise of women's soccer. During the evening, de Libran discovered that Shankar was familiar with the same corner of San Diego that she grew up in -- and that Shankar was a regular at her father's bakery, Champagne French, in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
A table-arranging tip: When choosing the color palette for a table, Bharti Pasricha always starts with a single shade that riffs on the food and builds from there. For this meal, she began with a soft green, adding golden tones and blue notes for depth. To hosts in search of very particular hues, she recommends the hand-dipped candles from the Danish company Ester and Erik, which come in more than 93 shades.

Charles F. Feeney, 92, Who Made a Fortune And Gave It Away, Dies: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After piling up billions in business, he pledged to donate almost all of his money to causes before he died. He succeeded, and then lived a more modest life.
Charles F. Feeney, a pioneer of duty-free shops and a shrewd investor in technology start-ups who gave away nearly all of his $ 8 billion fortune to charity, much of it as quietly as he had made it, died on Monday in San Francisco. He was 92.
His death was announced by the Atlantic Philanthropies, a group of foundations he had started and funded since the early 1980s. He lived in a modest rented apartment in San Francisco.
In December 2016, with his donation of $ 7 million to his alma mater, Cornell University, for student community-service work, Mr. Feeney officially emptied the Atlantic Philanthropies' accounts. It also fulfilled his pledge to give away virtually all of his wealth before he died, a rarity in the philanthropic world.
With what he called decent but unextravagant provisions made for his five adult children, Mr. Feeney said he retained about $ 2 million for himself, a small fraction of the billions he had amassed over six decades in business and given away over 35 years while often going to great lengths to conceal his identity, wealth and philanthropies.
"Chuck Feeney is a remarkable role model, and the ultimate example of giving while living," his fellow billionaire Bill Gates told Forbes in 2012. Another of the world's richest people, Warren Buffett, presented a Forbes 400 Lifetime Achievement Award to Mr. Feeney in 2014, calling him "my hero and Bill Gates's hero -- he should be everybody's hero."
Unlike philanthropists whose names are publicized, celebrated at banquets and emblazoned on building facades and museum wings, Mr. Feeney gave anonymously to universities, medical institutions, scientific endeavors, human rights groups, peace initiatives and scores of causes intended to improve lives in the United States, Vietnam, South Africa, Australia, Israel, Jordan and other lands.
An Irish American, he was far more open about his giving in Northern Ireland, which he visited frequently. His aid to Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political arm, and the Ulster Defense Association, the Protestant loyalist paramilitary group, helped secure the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 after decades of sectarian violence. In 2007, Mr. Feeney was invited to join leaders of the United States, Britain and Ireland at the birth of a power-sharing government in Belfast.
But his name appeared on none of the 1,000 buildings on five continents that he gave $ 2.7 billion to fund. Grants to institutions and individuals were paid by cashier's checks to conceal the source. Beneficiaries were told that the money came from a generous "client" who wished to remain anonymous. Those who learned his identity were told not to reveal his involvement.
His philanthropic organizations were incorporated in Bermuda to avoid United States disclosure requirements, although the arrangements disallowed United States tax deductions for his donations.
Mr. Feeney's was a life of remarkable contrasts. Raised in New Jersey by Roman Catholic working-class parents who struggled during the Depression, he served in the Air Force, studied hotel management in college and got into the duty-free shopping business by selling liquor, cigarettes and perfume to homeward-bound American servicemen in Europe in the 1950s.
The business went global. Profits were enormous. By the early 1980s he was plowing tax-free annual dividends of $ 35 million into hotels, land deals, retail shops and clothing companies. He later invested in tech start-ups and multiplied his income exponentially. By age 50, he had palatial homes in New York, London, Paris, Honolulu, San Francisco and Aspen, Colo., and on the French Riviera.
But he was troubled by an opulent life of black-tie dinners, grand yachts and values far from those of his family and friends in New Jersey.
"He was beginning to have doubts about his right to have so much money," Conor O'Clery wrote in a biography of Mr. Feeney, "The Billionaire Who Wasn't" (2007). "When asked many years later if he was rich at this point in his life, he replied: 'How much is rich? Beyond all expectations. Beyond all deserving, so to speak. I just reached the conclusion with myself that money, buying boats and all the trimmings didn't appeal to me."'
Mr. Feeney reversed his extravagant lifestyle, quitting wealthy social groups, flying economy class, buying his clothing off the rack and giving up fancy restaurants. He sold his limousines and took subways or cabs. He also resolved to give his money away anonymously, a course followed by only 1 percent of American givers, experts say.
"All Feeney's instincts, instilled in him by the example of his parents, by the sharing culture of his blue-collar upbringing in New Jersey, by his desire not to distance himself from his boyhood neighbors and friends, and by his own innate kindness and concern for others, undoubtedly shaped his decision," Mr. O'Clery wrote.
It was in 1982 that Mr. Feeney established in Bermuda the foundation that would become Atlantic Philanthropies. In 1984, he transferred to the foundation his 38.75 percent stake in the company he had co-founded, Duty Free Shoppers. Since there was no sale, the company's value was speculative, but some estimates said it may have exceeded $ 500 million.
Over the ensuing decades, as his other enterprises and profits also went to the foundation, Mr. Feeney funded public-health facilities in Vietnam; the University of Limerick and Trinity College in Ireland; AIDS clinics in South Africa; Operation Smile's free surgeries for children with cleft lips and palates; a medical campus for the University of California at San Francisco; and earthquake relief in Haiti. He gave $ 1 billion to Cornell, including $ 350 million for an affiliated technology institute in New York City.
His secret identity as a humanitarian benefactor was disclosed in 1997 after he and a partner sold their interest in Duty Free Shoppers to Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy. Legal filings put the value of his share at $ 1.6 billion and said it belonged not to Mr. Feeney but to his philanthropic entity in Bermuda, which had been making huge anonymous donations for 15 years.
Charles Francis Feeney was born in Elizabeth, N.J., on April 23, 1931, to Leo and Madaline Feeney. His father was an insurance underwriter who attended Mass daily. His mother was a nurse who discreetly helped others; each day, she gave a neighbor with Lou Gehrig's disease a ride to a bus stop, pretending it was on her way to work. Charles and his sisters, Arlene and Ursula, grew up in a household that struggled to pay a $ 32 monthly mortgage.
Charles had a Catholic education, attending St. Genevieve's Grammar School in Elizabeth and, on a scholarship, Regis High School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Unhappy there, he cheated on an exam, was expelled in his second year and switched to St. Mary of the Assumption High School in Elizabeth, graduating in 1948. He served four years in the Air Force, mostly with American occupation forces in Japan.
He graduated from Cornell's School of Hotel Administration in 1956 and moved to Europe. In Barcelona, Spain, he met a fellow Cornell alumnus, Robert Miller, and formed a partnership to sell duty-free luxuries to American servicemen on their way back to the states.
As postwar international tourism burgeoned, the demand for duty-free goods, including cars, exploded. Duty Free Shoppers grew into a global enterprise, with shops in airports and major cities across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Mr. Feeney became a multibillionaire.
In 1959, he married Danielle Morali-Daninos, a French citizen, in Paris. After producing five children, the marriage ended in divorce in the 1990s. Mr. Feeney gave all seven of his homes and a large financial settlement to his wife. He later married his longtime assistant, Helga Flaiz.
She survives him, along with his children from his first marriage -- his daughters Juliette Feeney-Timsit, Caroleen Feeney, Leslie Feeney Baily and Diane Feeney and his son, Patrick -- as well as 16 grandchildren.
In his last decades Mr. Feeney did not own a home or a car, wore a $ 10 wristwatch, preferred buses to taxis and, until he was 75, flew coach. He and his second wife lived in a two-bedroom rented apartment in San Francisco.
In 2010, Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett founded the Giving Pledge, whose signatories, including Mr. Feeney, promised to give most of their wealth to charity, though not necessarily in their lifetimes.
With virtually all of his fortune gone, Mr. Feeney officially shut down Atlantic Philanthropies in 2020.
Forbes said that no one of such riches had ever given away a fortune so completely while still alive. But as Mr. Feeney said as he signed on to the pledge: "I cannot think of a more personally rewarding and appropriate use of wealth than to give while one is living, to personally devote oneself to meaningful efforts to improve the human condition."

Under Her Considerable Influence: [Style Desk]

Full text: How Miuccia Prada -- and Miu Miu -- became the muse of the season. Plus a detour through Chanel and Louis Vuitton.
Want to know what you will wear next?
Quite possibly a rah-rah skirt so short it shows your rear end or (if you are of a mind-set that eschews rah-rah skirts) a pencil skirt or pair of trousers or even pair of men's swim trunks that sit so low on the hips they flirt with bumster-dom. They'll probably be cinched with a wide leather belt or at the very least expose the elastic logo waistband of your underwear.
With them, a schoolboy striped Oxford shirt, navy V-neck sweater and navy blazer. Or maybe you'll forget the pants and skirts entirely -- too much to think about! -- and just toss a jeweled flapper wrap dress or a gold brocade opera coat over your shirt. Then you might stuff an extra pair of shoes, the kind that gave you blisters so you had to put Band-Aids on your heels but you love them so you'll take them anyway, into your handbag before sprinting out the door.
Or that's what you may wear next if what appeared on the Miu Miu catwalk at the close of Paris Fashion Week is any indication.
But why, you say, scratching your head, would Miu Miu have anything to do with it?
Not just because the show was fantastic -- one that seemed to be channeling Simone de Beauvoir or Natalia Ginzburg en route to the flower market after a late night of pub quizzes and philosophical debate.
But because ever since Miuccia Prada enlisted Raf Simons as co-creative director at Prada in Milan, freeing herself up to pay more attention to what had always been seen as Prada's little sister line, the Miu Miu brand -- not to mention Mrs. Prada's whole aesthetic -- has quietly become one of the most influential in fashion.
If in doubt, simply consider the number of audience members who arrived at the show in hot pants and tights (not since the age of Mary Quant have so many upper thighs been so visible). Or consider how much Mrs. Prada's work has shaped what has appeared on other catwalks since this fashion month began.
Indeed, it would not be overstating things to say Mrs. Prada has been the muse of the season.
The Mrs. Prada Effect
It started during New York Fashion Week, when Joseph Altuzarra offered up what was essentially an ode to early Prada in cocooning uniform coats, sheer pencil skirts and frumpy knits -- a theme that was repeated three weeks later in Paris at Matthew M. Williams's show for Givenchy, which featured similar Prada-isms in pastel shades speckled among his lithe black dresses (elegant, but generic).
In Milan, short shorts -- the kind that looked an awful lot like the hot pants Mrs. Prada showed for Miu Miu last season, which were an evolution of the truncated skirts she showed the season before -- became the trend of the week at Gucci, Bally and Etro. Versace embraced the concept of the shorts set, which came in the wake of the Miu Miu set renaissance of early 2022.
Hot pants -- dotted with costume jewels even -- popped up again at Stella McCartney, paired with ruffled tuxedo shirts and cool suiting, amid the backdrop of the designer's sustainability market showcasing various material technologies, and a host of her own greatest hits. Even Victoria Beckham, who seems to be struggling to find a new fashion identity, threw some bodysuits, with undies peeking out around the edges, under cardigans into her mix of tailoring and transparency.
It's not that anyone is overtly referencing Mrs. Prada (or it's not like most of them are). But she has become so masterful at cozying up to the clichés of gender, burrowing down and recontextualizing them, so good at using clothes to wrestle with the desire to be pretty and frivolous and serious and stressed all at the same time that her work has started to shape the culture it reflects. In the real world of the street, and the digital world of influencers.
At which point it gets regurgitated back through the maw of other designers, amplifying the ideas. It's not trickle down or trickle up as much as trickle out.
A Detour to Vuitton and Chanel
The Miu Miu effect marks a pretty big shift in the biorhythms of fashion month. After all, years ago, when Mrs. Prada moved her Miu Miu show to Paris to create some breathing room between it and the Prada show in Milan, it was a sort of an addendum, or coda, to the week, after the mega brands of Chanel and Louis Vuitton had brought the season to an end. Lately, however, those shows seem increasingly niche; not smaller physically, but speaking mostly to an echo chamber of their own (paid) celebrities and acolytes.
Vuitton, for example, was held in the brand's new building on the Champs-Élysées, a former Art Deco palace hotel, now a construction site for what the brand would only describe as "a new project."
The soaring ground floor interior had been shrink-wrapped in orange plastic (100 percent recycled and 100 percent recyclable said the show notes) to resemble the interior of a hot-air balloon because, you know, travel (and the brand's birth as a trunk maker). And because the clothes from the designer Nicolas Ghesquière -- layers of striped and plaid mousseline belted at the hip, with leather jackets, candy-cane clown pants and elaborately beaded tweeds -- had their own floaty fussiness to match.
They were complicated-looking, no matter how light the construction, which paradoxically gave them a very French air. You don't want to wear them, but they are compelling all the same. Even if they also seem like a very acquired taste that might take too much effort to acquire, like sweetbreads.
At Chanel, meanwhile, Virginie Viard was riffing on the Villa de Noailles, the 1920s artistic salon in the South of France and the creative milieu Coco shared, with bouclés and seaside stripes, long-line bathing suits and flirty cover-ups, logos and flowers and pearls galore. The problem is, for every great piece -- a pleated black and white halter neck gown, for example, or a kind of ironically fun tweed caftan -- there's another that has all the subtlety of boardwalk souvenir shop Chanel without any of the irony.
"Whatever"
It's Mrs. Prada's self-awareness and ability to both love fashion and recognize the issues with it, to embrace the inherent tensions and related absurdity of even worrying about such tensions, that makes it possible for so many to recognize themselves (or their many selves) in her work.
"Fashion comes when you want a distraction, when you are not too serious," she said after the Miu Miu show. "But then you need to think about the rest, so you need clothes you can live with, and clothes that you can think with."
During the show, a piece of video art titled "Gravity & Grace" from the Qatari-American artist Sophia Al-Maria played on screens set up around the venue, featuring a stuntwoman, Ayesha Hussain, in those Prada hot pants, gas station jackets and knee-high boots, going through different exercises with a sword and a cross bow, and twirling around like a jewel-box ballerina. It didn't have much to do with what was on the runway, other than evincing, the show notes said, "a congruent intellectual viewpoint."
At the finale, after Cailee Spaeny -- the actor who plays Priscilla Presley in Sofia Coppola's coming biopic "Priscilla" -- had walked out in a plain black coat, the video flashed a close-up of a gum-chewing face and the word "whatever."
It was the perfect ending.

Nearly 99, Carter Savors Life, And Peanut Butter Ice Cream: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Carter was already the longest-living president in American history, but his staying power even in hospice has captured the imagination of admirers around the world.
Maybe it's the peanut butter ice cream he still enjoys. Or the fact that his first-place Atlanta Braves are cruising toward the playoffs and he wants to see another World Series. Or as many of his loved ones and former advisers suggest, maybe he is just too stubborn to follow anyone else's timetable.
Whatever the reason, seven months after entering hospice care, Jimmy Carter is still hanging on, thank you very much, and is in fact heading toward his 99th birthday in just over a week. While nearly everyone, including his family, assumed that the end was imminent when he gave up full-scale medical care last winter, the farmer-turned-president has once again defied expectations.
"We thought at the beginning of this process that it was going to be in five or so days," Jason Carter, his grandson, said in an interview, recalling the former president's decision to check out of the hospital and go into hospice care at his home in Plains, Ga., last February. "I was down there with him in the hospital and then said goodbye. And then we thought it was going to be in that week that it was coming to the end. And it's just now been seven months."
Mr. Carter was already the longest-living president in American history, but his staying power even in hospice has captured the imagination of many admirers around the world. It has generated an extended farewell, one that was unplanned yet remarkably affectionate for a president who was turned out of power by voters after a single term yet transformed his legacy with decades of service that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.
In the months since he returned to his small-town home to meet his final fate, the outpouring of remembrances has been heartening to his family and friends. Instead of a memorial service he could not attend, Mr. Carter has experienced a living eulogy, soaking up tributes from around the globe. Relatives and advisers say he is aware of what has been written and said, and is deeply grateful.
"He's got so much joy in seeing his presidency and post-presidency revisited," said Paige Alexander, the chief executive of the Carter Center, the nonprofit institution that served as the base for his philanthropic work over the last four decades. "In many ways, that keeps him going -- along with peanut butter ice cream."
Mr. Carter has withdrawn from the active life he led until not that long ago. The regular calls with Ms. Alexander are no longer so regular. What animated him for so long were not the ins and outs of the daily news but the projects he devoted his life to, like eradicating certain diseases from developing countries.
"He wasn't asking about politics or the economy," Ms. Alexander recalled. "He just wanted to know what the Guinea worm count was."
While Mr. Carter has good days and bad days, he has not lost his perspicacity or his sometimes curmudgeonly sense of humor. Ms. Alexander recalled a telephone conversation over the summer when she mentioned his upcoming big day.
"If I don't talk to you before your birthday, happy birthday," she recalled telling him.
"I'm going to be 99," he replied. "I'm not sure what's so happy about that."
Nonetheless, the Carter family, both those who are blood relations and those who are part of his longtime circle, are planning various celebrations to mark his century-minus-one milestone on Oct. 1.
The Carter Center is asking supporters to send pictures or videos that will be arranged in a digital mosaic. It collected 6,000 in the first three days, from celebrities like Martin Sheen and Jeff Daniels as well as everyday people from Africa and around the world. Peter Gabriel led an audience in a round of "Happy Birthday, Jimmy" at Madison Square Garden on Monday night.
The next night, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation presented its lifetime achievement award to Mr. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, with Ms. Alexander collecting on their behalf. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum will hold a naturalization swearing-in ceremony for new American citizens on his birthday. David Osborne, known as the "pianist to the presidents," will perform at Mr. Carter's Maranatha Baptist Church.
Mr. Carter was not suffering any particular ailment that prompted him to enter hospice care last February, according to people close to him, but was tired of being in and out of the hospital and wanted to spend his final days at home with Mrs. Carter. Hospice is defined as care for terminally ill patients when the priority is not to provide further treatment but to reduce pain and discomfort toward the end of life. It is meant for patients not expected to live more than six months.
Perhaps it should have been no surprise that Mr. Carter would ignore that time frame. He has been defying death longer than anyone who ever served in the Oval Office. In 2015, he beat cancer that had spread to his brain. In 2019, he bounced back from several falls, including one that broke a hip. "He's been faced with what he thought was the end multiple times," Jason Carter said.
He spends his days now in the house where he and Mrs. Carter have lived since 1961, a two-bedroom, one-story rambler so plain that The Washington Post once calculated that it was worth less than the Secret Service vehicles parked out front. His children and grandchildren take turns visiting with them, and he has a crew of caregivers but has not seen a doctor in more than six months. President Biden calls from time to time to check in.
"It's a day-to-day thing," said Kim Fuller, his niece. The children sometimes read him news articles, and he catches Braves games on television. "They holler at the TV and do everything you do normally when you're watching baseball," Ms. Fuller said.
Mr. Carter can no longer teach Sunday school at Maranatha as he did for so many years -- the church's website says almost optimistically that he will not be teaching "until further notice" -- so Ms. Fuller has taken over.
Her uncle watches her every Sunday on a live Facebook feed. At first, he would offer critiques. "He would let me know if I had said something that wasn't quite the way it should be," she said. "He doesn't anymore. I kind of miss that. I would like for him to."
Mrs. Carter, the genteel former first lady who made promoting mental health a cause while in the White House, announced in May that she had dementia, and the two of them spend days together quietly, recently celebrating their 77th anniversary. "She's very happy," Jason Carter said. "She's reminiscing and remembering some of the great times she's had." As Ms. Alexander put it, "They continue to offer us lessons in dignity and grace."
For Mrs. Carter's 96th birthday last month, Ms. Fuller said she organized a butterfly release at the house. Ms. Fuller said her uncle was aware of his own upcoming birthday.
"He wants to reach 99, I know that," she said. "The last month has been different for him," she added, but "I am just praying every day that he makes it to 99."
"It's a bittersweet one," she added. "We've all been on pins and needles since February. Every day's a celebration." But as her uncle has demonstrated time and again for nearly a century, no one will dictate to him. "He's going to do exactly what he wants to do when he wants to do it."
For Mr. Carter, any birthday celebration will be marked at home, surrounded by family.
"He's really significantly limited physically and he is coming to the end, there's no doubt about that," Jason Carter said. "He is, I think, frustrated by that. But he is at home. He's together with his wife. They're in love. They're at peace and you don't get more from that. You certainly don't get more than they got from this life. And the end is exactly how you would hope for it to be."

Bird-Watching With a Purpose: [Climate]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Thousands of people from around the world responded to the invitation, sharing their sightings with scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
One Saturday morning in June, Amy Simmons spotted some sparrows flitting around a coastal marsh in Maine. She and her two companions, all dedicated bird-watchers, quickly identified one of the foraging birds as a Nelson's sparrow, a small, round bird with a yellow stripe over its eye. Then, overhead, they spotted something slightly different. The stripe over this sparrow's eye had a more saturated, orange tint, and its breast was speckled with black and white.
It was a saltmarsh sparrow, a species threatened by sea level rise. Without significant conservation action, climate change could render the species extinct by the middle of this century, some scientists predict.
"It's a beautiful bird," said Ms. Simmons, who works in fund-raising at the National Audubon Society. "It's exciting to see it. But then it kind of breaks your heart at the same time. Because it is so threatened right now."
Ms. Simmons snapped some photos and logged the observation in eBird, a website and app that allows scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to collect observations from bird-watchers worldwide. The data has already helped scientists keep tabs on bird populations, many of which are in steep decline, and track how their behaviors and lives are shifting with a changing climate.
But the data has gaps; eBird generally receives fewer submissions in the summer than it does during the spring and fall migratory seasons, and much of the data comes from popular bird-watching locations, like parks and nature preserves. So this summer, The New York Times collaborated with the lab on a citizen science project, inviting readers to make birding part of their daily routines and to share their observations with researchers. Participants were encouraged to continue birding throughout the slow season and to venture beyond their favorite bird-watching haunts.
A video summarizing the project will be shown during The New York Times Climate Forward event on Thursday, where leaders in business, science and public policy will be discussing climate change and efforts to deal with it.
"People took that call to action to heart," said Jenna Curtis, who is a project leader for eBird at the Cornell lab.
Roughly 25,000 people, including Ms. Simmons, signed up to participate; 46 percent said that they were new to birding. Though it's unclear how many of them actually followed through, more than 2,000 people submitted eBird checklists using the designated #NYT hashtag; together, these eBird users submitted more than 95,000 checklists between mid-May and the end of August. Readers also submitted their drawings of birds and reported joining others for bird-watching outings.
Data provided by Cornell -- and interviews with participants -- also suggests that the project prompted existing eBird users to remain more engaged through the slow summer season and to submit data from a greater assortment of locations.
Karla Simpson, a relatively new birder in Indiana, said the project expanded her understanding of where she might find interesting birds. When she attended her niece's wedding in Michigan, she logged 20 species -- including wood ducks, northern flickers and red-bellied woodpeckers -- at a pond behind her hotel, a Fairfield Inn & Suites in a busy business district. "As long as there was habitat, there were birds," she said.
Ms. Simmons was not alone in logging a sighting of the saltmarsh sparrow; more than 100 people who used the #NYT hashtag reported seeing one, providing more data that experts might be able to use to better target conservation efforts, Dr. Curtis said. "It's super valuable information," she said. "They're seeing a bird that's on the brink, that their children or grandchildren might not see if we don't do something."
Many participants also reported seeing birds outside their typical ranges -- a red-bellied woodpecker outside Montreal, a Carolina wren in Vermont -- a sign that species are being pushed north by a warming climate. In Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Emily Clark spotted an anhinga, a long-necked water bird often found in Florida. "It's cool to see an anhinga in New York," Ms. Clark said. "But it's not necessarily a good thing, especially if they're being forced up here."
Climate change, and the extreme weather that comes with it, can also make life hard for birders; participants in this summer's project had to deal with extreme heat and unusual plumes of wildfire smoke.
Even with the not-always-favorable weather conditions, Ms. Clark said that the project motivated her to get back into birding after having a baby this spring, and that she hopes to share her love of birds with her new son. Bird-watching, she said, has brought her closer to her own father, a lifelong birder who gave her the middle name Wren. Ms. Clark passed the name on to her newborn, and when her father came into town to meet the baby, they bonded over the strange tropical bird that had landed in Brooklyn.
"On his first visit down to meet his new grandson," Ms. Clark said, "he hung out with the baby for a few hours and then he said, 'Is it all right if we make a quick trip to Prospect Park to see the anhinga?"'

At the Top of an Empire Built on 'Desirability': [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One afternoon in July, not long after being named the wealthiest man on the planet by Forbes, Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods empire, took his place on a stage with a view of the Eiffel Tower before a packed crowd of French dignitaries and reporters.
In the front row sat four of his five adult children -- the fifth was watching from New York, where he is an executive at Tiffany & Company. Their father had raised all of them since they could walk to one day run the LVMH conglomerate.
The occasion was Mr. Arnault's announcement that LVMH would provide 150 million euros (about $ 161 million) to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics. LVMH companies will play a starring role. Chaumet, a Paris jeweler whose clients once included Napoleon's wife Joséphine, will design the Olympic medals, and Moët Hennessy wines will flow in hospitality suites.
"The partnership will help promote France throughout the world," Mr. Arnault declared. As television cameras zoomed in, his eldest son, Antoine, the head of communications and image for LVMH, uttered what could be a tagline for this huge company his father has built: "For a dream, there is no price."
It was a moment of public triumph for Mr. Arnault, a sign of how embedded in the fabric of France LVMH has become. Over more than 30 years, he has forged LVMH into the world's largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France, with a presence in 81 countries. His brands -- 75 of them -- are the stars of the luxury world, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom Pérignon Champagne. It has given him entree to prime ministers and presidents, and allowed him to amass a museum-worthy art collection.
But his success has brought challenges. In France, Mr. Arnault has become a lightning rod for anger over growing economic inequality. In April, 10 days after Forbes put him atop its annual list of richest people, protesters stormed his office in Paris during nationwide strikes over raising the retirement age. His effigy was burned as a symbol of capitalist evil.
Mr. Arnault's five children were taught in France's best schools and raised to take leadership posts in the business, but his dream of keeping LVMH in the family may force him to elevate one above the rest.
And in recent months LVMH's stock has taken a beating, down 19 percent since hitting a high in April. The company reported a dip in U.S. sales in the second quarter, and the Chinese economy, a big source of LVMH's revenue, is faltering.
The falling shares mean that Mr. Arnault (now worth about $ 195 billion, Forbes says) dropped to the second-richest person in the world in June, eclipsed by Elon Musk. This month, LVMH was replaced as Europe's most valuable company by Denmark's Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, the hugely popular drugs being used for weight loss.
At 74, Mr. Arnault has been working to make sure his company -- created by gobbling up many European luxury houses that had been weakened by bickering family owners -- will stay firmly in his family's hands, safe from corporate raiders like himself. Last year, he persuaded the board to raise the mandatory retirement age for the chief executive and chairman to 80, from 75, and created a corporate structure that ensures the family's control of LVMH, locking in his children -- each of whom has been named to highly visible positions within the company -- as the chief decision makers.
Mr. Arnault has broadened LVMH beyond extravagant playthings into the world of experiences, acquiring over 50 grand hotels and resorts. And with the Olympics deal, he has extended his tentacles more deeply into the world of sports.
Mr. Arnault's changes mean he doesn't have to retire next year as originally expected. That hasn't stopped speculation about whether he can ensure that his heirs -- who dress in almost identical Dior navy suits (save for Delphine, his one daughter, who often wears Dior skirts) -- avoid a "Succession"-like drama.
The French media is full of headlines comparing the Arnaults to the Roys, the fictional family in the HBO series. There are TikTok videos explaining why the Arnaults are "the real 'Succession' family." The family hates this talk, and takes pains to play down parallels to the show.
A Family Affair
The eldest sibling is Delphine, 48, chairman and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture and a member of the LVMH executive committee and its board. Antoine, 46, is not only in charge of the group's image and sustainability efforts but chief executive of its men's wear brand Berluti, chairman of the Italian luxury house Loro Piana, chief executive of Christian Dior S.E. and a member of the LVMH board. Both are from Mr. Arnault's first marriage, to Anne Dewavrin. The youngest three are from Mr. Arnault's second marriage, to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist: Alexandre, 31, is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany; Frédéric, 28, is chief executive of Tag Heuer; and Jean, 24, is Louis Vuitton's watch director.
In a rare interview in LVMH's discreetly lavish headquarters in Paris -- this article is the first for which Mr. Arnault and his children have agreed to talk on the record to an international newspaper -- Mr. Arnault brushed off any comparison to television's Roys with a wave of his hand.
"It's not an obligation, nor inevitable, that a kid is my successor," he said, leaning back in a buttery leather chair at a round table in his private conference room. On one wall was a Picasso; on two others, Warhols. His son Antoine, in his role as image gatekeeper, sat across the table.
Mr. Arnault was wearing a white shirt, a blue tie, a navy jacket and black slacks, though these days he's usually without a tie, Antoine said, part of a more casual uniform that has accompanied new efforts to engage with the outside world. The children have been instrumental in pushing their father to be more open about the conglomerate.
"The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor," Mr. Arnault continued. "But it's not something that I hope is a duel for the near future."
Still, legacy is clearly on Mr. Arnault's mind. He grew up in Roubaix, once a booming textile center in northern France, and watched family industrial dynasties collapse as children or grandchildren took their eyes off the business or squandered inheritances.
"After one or two generations, it broke down because they had it too easy," he said. It was a mistake he vowed not to make with his own children. "I didn't want them to start going to big parties," Mr. Arnault said. "I made them work."
Business at the Dining Table
Every month, the five siblings meet with their father over lunch on the top floor of LVMH's headquarters.
For an hour and a half, they discuss business, including finances, the curve of the bracelet on a new €50,000 Vuitton watch, upcoming product introductions and the social media payoff of over-the-top events. For example, a Vuitton men's wear show by the brand's new designer, Pharrell Williams, shut down Paris's Pont Neuf and attracted such names as Kim Kardashian and LeBron James, resulting in over 16 million YouTube hits.
"Make no mistake," Jean said. "We discuss things, but at the end, it's he who decides."
Amid the bonhomie, the siblings say, Mr. Arnault is gauging how each of his children is measuring up.
A graduate of France's elite École Polytechnique, Mr. Arnault honed his children's math skills nearly every night before dinnertime. Antoine recalled that getting anything less than a perfect grade on important exams "wasn't acceptable."
Jean jokes about having "24 years of experience, because every lunch and dinner was always about work."
Ian Rogers, a former chief digital officer at LVMH, said Alexandre had told him, "My business education started when I was 9, at the breakfast table."
By age 10, Delphine was accompanying her father to Dior stores. He has made weekend inspections of LVMH properties in Paris with his children a routine for more than three decades. Alexandre said: "I remember, age 7, thinking, 'Why is he doing this, and why is he asking the same question to the same salesperson, every Saturday of the year?"'
The father paired each of his children with a mentor as they entered the business, to teach them the brands and monitor their performance. Delphine and Antoine started in novice positions (Delphine sold Dior perfume at age 17) before ascending to the C-suite. The three youngest moved more quickly into senior roles, "probably because he feels time is running out and he needs to speed up the process of learning," said Pierre-Yves Roussel, a former chief of the LVMH fashion group and the current chief executive of Tory Burch.
All of them understand that the family itself is now as much a brand as the brands they own, and have wasted no time making their presence known.
In less than two years at Tiffany, Alexandre helped seal a deal with Beyoncé and Jay-Z, creating a social media sensation. (In 2016, Alexandre persuaded his father to acquire Rimowa, a German maker of aluminum suitcases, which was founded in 1898. He immediately set about making the utilitarian luggage company cool.) Delphine created the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, a high-profile talent competition. And Antoine has thrown wide the previously closed doors of many LVMH companies with a series of "open days" that invite the public inside factories and workshops.
Their father never forced them to join LVMH, the children said. Even so, Frédéric said, "he found a way to make me want to give my life to the family business like he did." (Children from both marriages grew up vacationing together, and were raised to play tennis and piano -- their father's favorite pastimes.)
The clan has gotten bigger after two glamorous marriages: Antoine to the model and philanthropist Natalia Vodianova, and Alexandre to Géraldine Guyot, who has an accessories brand, Destree, that is independent of LVMH. Delphine's partner is a digital entrepreneur and billionaire, Xavier Niel.
When Alexandre wed Geraldine in Venice in 2021, guests included Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Roger Federer (who frequently plays tennis with Mr. Arnault). His three brothers were groomsmen. They share a family group chat, in which they swap baby pictures.
"I know it's disappointing for a lot of people," Antoine said, "but we actually get on well."
The iPhone vs. Dom Pérignon
Mr. Arnault was born into a construction company run by his father and founded by his grandfather, who took him to building sites when he was 7.
When Mr. Arnault was 28, his father handed him the keys to the business. He refocused it on real estate, and soon after moved to New Rochelle, N.Y., to expand in an environment friendlier to entrepreneurs than socialist France.
It was the era of the corporate raider, and Mr. Arnault soaked in the more aggressive approach to mergers and acquisitions. When he returned to Paris at 35, after a rather unsuccessful run developing condominiums in Palm Beach, Fla., he came back as a barbarian at the gate -- and with a new idea: A New York cabdriver had told him that he didn't know the name of France's president, "but I know Dior!"
As it happened, the French government wanted to unload a bankrupt textile conglomerate that included Dior. Mr. Arnault bought it for 1 franc, fired 9,000 people and discarded everything except Dior, which he then used to help finance a brutal takeover of LVMH, a group recently formed from the luggage maker Louis Vuitton and the Moët Hennessy Champagne and cognac house.
The battle for LVMH made his reputation. Enlisted by Henry Racamier, one of LVMH's founders, to buy shares and prevent another group from gaining control, Mr. Arnault did as he was asked, but didn't stop. He ultimately turned the tables, seized control of LVMH and forced out Mr. Racamier, who said at the time, "We would like to find a modus vivendi, but it's hard with a person like that."
His style sent shock waves through the clubby world of French business, where he became known as "the Wolf in Cashmere." It was the beginning of a three-decade spree of empire building. He pursued family-owned brands known for craftsmanship and style: Pucci, Fendi, Celine, Loro Piana. Some were happy to be bought out; some were not. Losses were rare: Gucci and Hermès slipped through his fingers after ugly public battles.
During Mr. Arnault's takeover of Tiffany in 2020, as the pandemic hurt earnings, he was accused of enlisting the French government's help to delay the deal's closing, and in the end won a discount on the negotiated price. (At $ 16 billion, it remains the luxury sector's biggest deal.)
He has expanded LVMH into luxury hospitality in recent years. LVMH's holdings include the Cipriani hotel in Venice, the Orient Express train and the "21" Club in New York. There are restaurants in flagship stores for Tiffany and Dior, and a new four-story Moët cocktail bar in Paris.
Mr. Arnault's bets have usually paid off. Luxury, in all its forms, has been one of the most resilient investments on Wall Street in the last decade.
"He was always saying, 'The iPhone is great, but who knows if we will be using an iPhone in 10 years?"' Mr. Rogers, the former chief digital officer, said. "'Whereas I know people will continue to drink Dom Pérignon."'
Mr. Arnault has steered clear of picking sides when dealing with polarizing world leaders, whether cutting the ribbon on a new Vuitton factory in Texas alongside Donald J. Trump, who was president at the time, or meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to seal a loan of art to his museum in Paris, the Fondation Louis Vuitton.
"We are like Henry Kissinger," Mr. Arnault said. "We are not there to agree or disagree on the political aspect of the country in which we are doing business."
'They Need to Find a Type of Enemy'
Mr. Arnault insisted repeatedly during the interview that his main goal was not profits. "It's desirability," he said, "and we must make sure that in 50 years we are still at the top."
"Desirability," said Mr. Roussel, the former LVMH executive, is the most popular word at the company. But it highlights a potential problem, he said: "A consumer waking up and saying, 'You know, I'm buying this product, but there's someone making so much money out of it."'
"Is it desirable that you're buying a product from someone who is the richest man in the world?"
That sentiment was not evident this summer when Mr. Arnault visited China, one of LVMH's most lucrative markets. The "richest man" headlines from months earlier earned him a rock star's welcome. In Shanghai and Chengdu, crowds followed him and vied for selfies. Mothers asked him to bless their babies.
"Like the pope. Can you believe that?" he said. He was called, he said with a laugh, "the God of Fortune."
But back home, where passion about social and financial inequality stretches back to the French Revolution, Mr. Arnault is a divisive figure: hailed by the business and political worlds for building France's biggest corporate titan, and reviled by others for his almost unimaginable wealth.
For a family that tries to keep its fortune discreet, the "richest man" ranking this year still brings an unwelcome spotlight.
"The attention that you get when you're on the top of that list," Antoine said, "you can't really prepare for that."
In April, as France's raucous nationwide protests gathered steam over President Emmanuel Macron's bid to raise the retirement age two years to 64, demonstrators broke into the LVMH headquarters, lighting smoke bombs and denouncing Mr. Arnault as the embodiment of the ultrarich.
"He is a symbol of what is wrong in this society!" one shouted. Others carried signs showing Mr. Arnault as Mr. Monopoly in a top hat, with accusations that he evaded taxes, exploited workers and laid off thousands to build power and wealth.
This month, when Mr. Arnault announced that the Arnault family would donate €10 million to Restos du Coeur, a food bank, critics said it was a drop in the bucket.
"They need to find a type of enemy," Mr. Arnault said. "France is not a country which is motivated by business success, unlike the United States."
When his friend Warren Buffett walks around Manhattan, Mr. Arnault added, "he's like a Beatle." But when Mr. Arnault visits his stores in France, "I have to be careful," he said. "I don't like this, but I need bodyguards."
Antoine has advised his father to push back, and these days Mr. Arnault stresses the company's economic contributions: hundreds of thousands of jobs created worldwide, €5.5 billion paid annually in French taxes, and vast sums for art and culture, energy sustainability, scientific research, sports and youths.
Who's Next?
What no one debates is that Mr. Arnault understood, before almost anyone else, luxury's potential as a generator of profit -- that creating beautiful things is about aspiration and belonging.
The question now is who can keep desirability at the heart of LVMH in an age of protests and global economic uncertainty.
Last year, Mr. Arnault tinkered with the corporate structure of his empire, concentrating decision-making with his five children. Each has a 20 percent stake, and they cannot sell their shares for 30 years without unanimous board approval.
His heirs "have been schooled by the best player in the world: All of them know the business," said Sidney Toledano, head of the LVMH fashion group and one of Mr. Arnault's longest-serving executives. "Are they going to be the pilots? Maybe."
If the next chief executive is not named Arnault, the children say they are OK with that. After all, Alexandre said, "there's the risk that none of us is able to run the business as well as he has."
The siblings are beginning to discuss how they can raise their own children with the same sense of duty that was instilled in them, Delphine said. Mr. Arnault has begun taking her elementary-school-age daughter on his weekend rounds of stores.
But Alexandre added: "By the time they reach ages where they can have responsibilities, my father will still probably be C.E.O. of LVMH. He'll be 110 years old."

PARIS — One afternoon in July, not long after being named the wealthiest man on the planet by Forbes, Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods empire, took his place on a stage before a crowd of French dignitaries and reporters.
In the front row sat four of his five adult children — the fifth was watching from New York, where he is an executive at Tiffany & Co. Their father had raised all of them to one day run the LVMH conglomerate.
The occasion was Arnault’s announcement that LVMH would provide 150 million euros (about $161 million) to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics. LVMH companies will play a starring role. Chaumet, a Paris jeweler, will design the Olympic medals, and Moët Hennessy wines will flow in hospitality suites.
“The partnership will help promote France throughout the world,” Arnault declared. As television cameras zoomed in, his eldest son, Antoine, the head of communications and image for LVMH, uttered what could be a tagline for this huge company his father has built: “For a dream, there is no price.”
It was a moment of public triumph for Arnault, a sign of how embedded in the fabric of France LVMH has become. Over more than 30 years, he has forged LVMH into the world’s largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France, with a presence in 81 countries. His brands — 75 of them — are the stars of the luxury world, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom Pérignon Champagne.
But his success has brought challenges. In France, Arnault has become a lightning rod for anger over growing economic inequality. In April, 10 days after Forbes put him atop its annual list of richest people, protesters stormed his office in Paris during nationwide strikes over raising the retirement age.
And in recent months LVMH’s stock has taken a beating, down 19% since hitting a high in April. The company reported a dip in U.S. sales in the second quarter, and the Chinese economy, a big source of LVMH’s revenue, is faltering.
At 74, Arnault has been working to make sure his company — created by gobbling up many European luxury houses that had been weakened by bickering family owners — will stay firmly in his family’s hands. Last year, he persuaded the board to raise the mandatory retirement age for the CEO and chair to 80, from 75, and created a corporate structure that ensures the family’s control of LVMH, locking in his children — each of whom has been named to highly visible positions within the company — as the chief decision-makers.
Arnault’s changes mean he doesn’t have to retire next year as originally expected. That hasn’t stopped speculation about whether he can ensure that his heirs avoid a “Succession”-like drama. (The French media is full of headlines comparing the Arnaults with the Roys, the fictional family in the HBO series. The family hates this talk, and takes pains to play down parallels to the show.)
The eldest sibling is Delphine, 48, chair and CEO of Christian Dior Couture and a member of the LVMH executive committee and its board. Antoine, 46, is not only in charge of the group’s image and sustainability efforts but CEO of its menswear brand Berluti, chair of the Italian luxury house Loro Piana, CEO of Christian Dior SE and a member of the LVMH board. Both are from Arnault’s first marriage, to Anne Dewavrin. The youngest three are from Arnault’s second marriage, to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist: Alexandre, 31, is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany; Frédéric, 28, is CEO of Tag Heuer; and Jean, 24, is Louis Vuitton’s watch director.
In a rare interview in LVMH’s headquarters in Paris, Arnault brushed off any comparison with television’s Roys.
“It’s not an obligation, nor inevitable, that a kid is my successor,” he said. “The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor. But it’s not something that I hope is a duel for the near future.”
Every month, the five siblings meet with their father over lunch on the top floor of LVMH’s headquarters.
For an hour and a half, they discuss business, including finances, upcoming product introductions and the social media payoff of over-the-top events. For example, a Vuitton menswear show by the brand’s new designer Pharrell Williams attracted such names as Kim Kardashian and LeBron James, resulting in over 16 million YouTube hits.
“Make no mistake,” Jean said. “We discuss things, but at the end, it’s he who decides.”
Amid the bonhomie, the siblings say, Arnault is gauging how each of his children is measuring up.
A graduate of France’s elite École Polytechnique, Arnault honed his children’s math skills nearly every night before dinnertime. Antoine recalled that getting anything less than a perfect grade on important exams “wasn’t acceptable.”
Ian Rogers, a former chief digital officer at LVMH, said Alexandre had told him, “My business education started when I was 9, at the breakfast table.”
By age 10, Delphine was accompanying her father to Dior stores. He has made weekend inspections of LVMH properties in Paris with his children a routine for more than three decades.
The father paired each of his children with a mentor as they entered the business, to teach them the brands and monitor their performance. Delphine and Antoine started in novice positions before ascending to the C-suite. The three youngest moved more quickly into senior roles, “probably because he feels time is running out and he needs to speed up the process of learning,” said Pierre-Yves Roussel, a former chief of the LVMH fashion group and the current CEO of Tory Burch.
All of them understand that the family itself is now as much a brand as the brands they own, and have wasted no time making their presence known.
In less than two years at Tiffany, Alexandre helped seal a deal with Beyoncé and Jay-Z, creating a social media sensation. (In 2016, Alexandre persuaded his father to acquire Rimowa, a German maker of aluminum suitcases, which was founded in 1898. He immediately set about making the utilitarian luggage company cool.) Delphine created the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, a high-profile talent competition. And Antoine has thrown wide the previously closed doors of many LVMH companies with a series of “open days” that invite the public inside factories and workshops.
Arnault insisted repeatedly during the interview that his main goal was not profits. “It’s desirability,” he said, “and we must make sure that in 50 years we are still at the top.”
“Desirability,” said Roussel, is the most popular word at the company. But it highlights a potential problem, he said: “A consumer waking up and saying, ‘You know, I’m buying this product, but there’s someone making so much money out of it.’
“Is it desirable that you’re buying a product from someone who is the richest man in the world?”
In France, Arnault is a divisive figure: hailed by the business and political worlds for building the country’s biggest corporate titan, and reviled by others for his almost unimaginable wealth.
In April, as France’s nationwide protests gathered steam over President Emmanuel Macron’s bid to raise the retirement age two years to 64, demonstrators broke into the LVMH headquarters, denouncing Arnault as the embodiment of the ultrarich. “He is a symbol of what is wrong in this society!” one shouted.

North Korean Dynasts' Mystery Train: [Correction]

Full text: Heading to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin, the North Korean leader chose to travel by rail, on a train with some unusual features.
When outside intelligence officials seek evidence of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, leaving on a trip abroad -- like his journey to Russia this week to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin -- they always look for the whereabouts of a train painted a drab green.
One such train was spotted on Monday heading north, near where the borders of North Korea, Russia and China meet. It was moving in the direction of Vladivostok, where Mr. Putin is attending an economic forum. On Tuesday, North Korean state media confirmed that Mr. Kim had indeed left Pyongyang, the North's capital, for Russia by train. South Korean officials said soon afterward that he had crossed the border.
The green train that officials look for is the special bulletproof one that Mr. Kim -- and his father and grandfather, who ruled North Korea before him -- has used to visit China, Russia or the former Soviet Union. Family members were said to lack confidence that they could make a safe long-distance trip using one of their country's decrepit fleet of old Soviet-era passenger jets.
While much about Mr. Kim's latest journey remains a mystery, here is what we know about the train:
More powerful than a speeding bullet, but much slower
Much of what is known about the train comes from intelligence reports, recollections of officials permitted to travel on board in previous eras and rare state news media footage.
There are believed to be at least 90 high-security carriages at the leader's disposal, according to a 2009 South Korea news report that relied on classified information. According to the report, written during the era of Mr. Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, three trains operate each time the leader travels: an advance security train, the leader's train and a third carrying additional bodyguards and supplies.
Each of the carriages is bulletproof, making them thousands of pounds heavier than average. That additional weight translates to a slow ride. The trains are estimated to reach a maximum speed of just 37 miles per hour.
In Kim Jong-il's time, according to the 2009 report, 100 security officers traveled in the advance train, searching stations for bombs and other threats and testing the safety of the track. Additionally, military helicopters and airplanes would fly overhead to provide more security.
Twenty train stations have been built across North Korea just for the leader's personal use, according to the report.
All the comforts of home
North Korea's state news media occasionally covered the leaders from inside the train, offering a rare glimpse at some of the many specialized cars.
When Kim Jong-un made his first state visit to China in 2018, he met a senior Chinese official who boarded his train in a carriage lined with thick pink sofas.
In 2015, Kim Jong-un was seen seated at a long white table in what appeared to be a conference room. In a similar video from 2011, his father, Kim Jong-il, is seen holding court in the same compartment. In the older video, a flat-screen television is clearly visible, and in the more recent one, a laptop computer can be seen.
The former leader's office car, including a desk and computer, is preserved as a museum exhibit at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, Kim Jong-il's mausoleum in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
Lobster, wine and 'lady conductors'
Kim Jong-il was rumored to have had a fear of flying and preferred to travel on his train, which was outfitted with modern communications technology and a large staff that catered to his whims.
"It was possible to order any dish of Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and French cuisine," wrote Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian official who traveled with the former leader during a 2011 trip through Russia.
Mr. Kim insisted that live lobster and other fresh delicacies be delivered to the train as it crossed Siberia on trips to Russia. Cases of Bordeaux and Burgundy wines were flown in from Paris, Mr. Pulikovsky recounted in his memoir of the trip, "Orient Express."
When bored, Mr. Kim relied on a group of female entertainers known as lady conductors to serenade him in Korean and Russian.
It is unknown what his son, Kim Jong-un, does for nourishment and entertainment while on board, but the younger Mr. Kim's appetite is known to rival his father's. He reportedly prefers Swiss cheese, Cristal Champagne and Hennessy cognac.
Tragedies on the tracks
The train has been at the center of several tragic events in modern North Korean history.
More than 160 people were killed in Ryongchon, near the Chinese border, in April 2004, when trains laden with combustible material exploded because of a collision or an electrical malfunction.
There were initial rumors that the explosion was part of an attempt on Kim Jong-il's life because the leader's train had passed through the town hours earlier.
According to the state news media, he would later die aboard his train after a heart attack in December 2011.
After he became leader, Kim Jong-un visited China four times and Vietnam once -- all by train, except for a 2018 flight to the Chinese city of Dalian. He also visited Russia by train and met Mr. Putin in 2019.

Full text: Whether it's a "yurt village" in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains or a riverside mansion in Cognac country in France, here are places where food and nature enthusiasts can mark the season's end.
It's late summer, when farm stands are bursting with color, piled with fruits and vegetables in the weeks before the season draws to a close. And where better to enjoy a summer harvest -- or to try your hand at activities like beekeeping, foraging, even the art of ax-throwing -- than at a farm or vineyard hotel?
Whether you want to escape to a working farm just outside of Nashville; a farm and vineyard with an inn and "yurt village" in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia; or a restored distillery and boutique hotel on a river in Cognac, France, these getaways for epicures and country-lovers await with fresh eggs, jams and food for the soul.
Bristol, Va.
Nicewonder Farm & Vineyards
Wander this 450-acre farm and vineyard amid the Blue Ridge Mountains (its viognier, chardonnay and merlot have been winners of the Virginia Governor's Cup competition) and you'll find cattle, chickens, vegetable gardens -- and a new 28 room-and-suite inn. Or you can stay in the "yurt village": nine yurts made of cedar, making them feel more like cabins, situated between the inn and the winery's tasting room. Book a yurt and you'll have your own kitchenette and rainfall shower, as well as a porch and back deck from which to breathe in the mountain air. Each yurt can sleep two to six people; pets are welcome, too (for a fee).
As you might expect, meals at Nicewonder are farm-to-table affairs. Hickory, on the ground floor of the inn, serves seasonal, Appalachian-inspired dishes -- like whipped Spam with house pickles, nori, yuzu hot sauce and fried saltines -- and overlooks a lake and the vineyard. There's also a bar and, of course, a wine cellar. And you can shop for flowers, vegetables, jams and jellies at the property's produce market. In fact, you could spend an entire weekend just eating and imbibing. Yet there are miles of trails to tackle, leading you past trees, over hills and near a creek. You can go for a swim in the infinity pool and, come September, work out in a new "fitness yurt" with spin bikes and exercise equipment, or unwind with a spa treatment in the forthcoming "spa yurt village." Prices from $ 335 a night in August and September, including breakfast.
Los Olivos, Calif.
The Inn at Mattei's Tavern, Auberge Resorts Collection
A former stagecoach stop, this property, situated near the vineyards and farms of the Santa Ynez Valley, has been receiving guests since the late 1880s. Shuttered in 2018, it reopened this year after a renovation that included new buildings and a new name. You can choose from 67 rooms, four of which are restored cottages dating to the early 1900s. There are new guest rooms, each with a patio, terrace or sun porch, situated in structures called Guest Houses. Also new is the two-bedroom Courtyard cottage with a living room and private outdoor space where you can end the day beside an outdoor fireplace or in a hot tub. The Homestead cottage has two bedrooms and private outdoor space as well.
Beyond your sleeping quarters is the Tavern restaurant, where many of the ingredients come from an on-site garden and the menu focuses on grilled proteins and vegetables, served indoors or outside beneath a trellis. For dishes inspired by Chinese cuisine -- think duck won tons, soy-braised Chinese eggplant, crispy pork belly, spicy peanuts, grilled shiitakes and shrimp toast -- pop into Gin's Tap Bar, named for the property's former chef, Gin Lung Gin. Need a caffeine fix? Try Felix Feed & Coffee, where you can also order fresh baked goods and breakfast. For a cocktail or a glass of wine, head to the Bar. Or put on a bathing suit and visit the Shed, a poolside bar with casual Mediterranean-inspired fare. After a bite and a dip, hop on a bicycle and go for a ride past vineyards -- or stay put and learn how to infuse your own olive oil with herbs from the garden. Prices from $ 950 a night.
Cognac, France
La Nauve Hôtel et Jardin
While France is known for major wine regions like Bordeaux and Champagne, this restored distillery and boutique hotel aims to lure you to Cognac country in southwest France, home to leading producers such as Hennessy, Martell and Rémy Martin. The hotel opened in June in a belle epoque mansion by the Charente River and is part of the Almae Collection of hotels as well as a member of the hotel network Relais & Chateaux. Its 12 suites are set amid 12 acres of gardens rife with fruit trees, rose bushes and vegetables. Crack open a favorite novel, ease into the swimming pool, or follow the gardens toward the river. There, private canoes await. Or you can board the hotel's boat and visit the town of Cognac. E-bikes are also available.
Meals can be had at Notes, a fine-dining restaurant with a four-course or seven-course tasting menu that makes use of herbs and vegetables from the property's gardens, as well as ingredients from Cognac distilleries and local farms. Alternatively, head over to the old distillery building, which is now Brasserie des Flâneurs, where the French brasserie menu highlights seasonal produce like ceviche with citrus fruit from the property's greenhouse. There's also the Bar and Tea Room, connected to a terrace where you can have a pastry (or two) with your tea or coffee. Should you prefer something a bit stronger, you can order a cocktail, wine or -- what else?-- Cognac. Prices from 450 euros, or about $ 490, a night, including breakfast.
Amenia, N. Y.
Troutbeck
This storied Hudson Valley country estate about two hours north of Manhattan has attracted a long list of writers and thinkers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and W.E.B. Du Bois. In the early 1900s the property was bought from its original owners, the Benton family, by Amy and Joel E. Spingarn, one of the founders of the publisher Harcourt, Brace & Co. and a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. (he was the originator of the Spingarn Medal, awarded annually by the N.A.A.C.P.). Today the 250-acre property is a member of Design Hotels and has 37 rooms and suites. Recently, it opened Benton House along Webutuck Creek, where you'll find 13 guest rooms, each with private outdoor space amid grasses and wildflowers. All look to nature for inspiration, with grass cloth wallpaper and beds by the Connecticut-based furniture maker Ian Ingersoll.
Head to the barns -- which are covered in timber reclaimed from the old Tappan Zee Bridge Hudson River crossing -- for a fitness or yoga class, or to use the gym and sauna. Outside you can play tennis, swim in the pool, stroll through a walled garden built in 1916, or take a private falconry session. You can hike and bike on the property, too. Or venture a little farther for a fly-fishing excursion, or a trip to nearby Maitri Farm, where you can browse produce and flowers (private tours are also available). Birders may want to check out the Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy. Other guests, in the tradition of Troutbeck, may simply want to sit back and converse over a meal. Settle into a booth in the Dining Room for seasonal dishes with local ingredients, like spelt ricotta cavatelli with chanterelles and garlic scapes. For bites on the go and late-night snacks, the Pantry offers temptations like salted chocolate chip cookies, coffee cake, brownies and blondies made in-house and available 24 hours. Prices from $ 400 a night.
Franklin, Tenn.
Southall Farm & Inn
Just 25 miles south of Nashville's buzzing music scene, this nascent farm and inn offers a buzz of a different sort with seven apiaries that house millions of honeybees, along with some 1,300 apple trees, greenhouses (including an orangerie), formal kitchen gardens, crops and plenty of land for foraging fungi and berries. While the property calls to mind a historic farm, it has the comforts of a modern escape. You can choose from 62 rooms and suites, 16 cottages and many places to savor the land's bounty. For casual meals, try Sojourner, where you can begin each day with pastries and eggs (lunch and dinner are also available). Even the cocktails are made with freshly harvested herbs and juices. Stop by the Farm Stand for produce, picnic baskets and preserves. And later this year, be on the lookout for January, a restaurant with a dining room and outdoor patio that plans to offer multicourse menus with ingredients grown at Southall.
If the pastoral views are not enough to shed your stress, head over to the 15,000-square-foot spa to decompress with treatments that use botanicals and ingredients, some from the farm. You can work out at the fitness center, float in the 104-degree mineral pool (there's an outdoor pool, too), strike a pose at the property's hilltop meditation and yoga spot, or challenge yourself on the ropes-and-obstacle course. Runners and hikers can take advantage of more than five miles of trails. And there's no shortage of additional outdoor activities (some for a fee), including falconry, fishing, bee keeping, archery and ax-throwing. Prices from $ 559 a night in August, and from $ 839 beginning in September.

2 Big Names In Fashion Are Merging: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The two fashion conglomerates, Tapestry and Capri Holdings, generate about $ 12 billion in combined revenue.
Tapestry, the fashion company that owns Coach and Kate Spade, said on Thursday that it had acquired Capri Holdings, the parent of Versace and Michael Kors, for about $ 8.5 billion in cash, as consolidation in the luxury market gathers pace.
The deal between two large American companies with familiar luxury brands comes as high-end retailers look for growth amid signs that U.S. consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending. It also comes as the most dominant luxury players jostle to snap up brands and broaden their portfolios.
Combined, the two groups would generate about $ 12 billion in revenue, bringing brands like Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman together with Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors. Once the transaction is completed, they will operate under the name Tapestry.
The move is the boldest effort yet by American fashion executives to build a collective that might be able to compete with the might of European giants like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, which owns brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent.
The chief executives of Tapestry and Capri stressed that the combination would bring their handbags, shoes and apparel to a broader consumer base and allow them to tap more resources. The acquisition will help expand Tapestry's reach in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while Capri's brands will gain more exposure in Asia.
The companies said the merger also presented an opportunity to increase their direct-to-consumer businesses and save $ 200 million in operating and supply-chain costs within three years.
"It represents a very compelling financial opportunity," Joanne Crevoiserat, the chief executive of Tapestry, said in an interview. "We're finding with this combination an opportunity to deepen our engagement with luxury customers on the high end."
On a call with investors on Thursday, analysts focused their questions on how the two companies would integrate and the timeline for the cost savings that would result. Executives emphasized that pooling resources would allow their brands to share digital and marketing abilities, transportation and supply chains, a strategy that is often referred to as synergies.
"Synergies are always easier said than done, so this will clearly bear monitoring," Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. "But if there were ever two companies to enjoy synergies, Tapestry and Capri align."
Executives expressed confidence at being able to integrate their brands.
"By joining with Tapestry, we will have greater resources and capabilities to accelerate the expansion of our global reach while preserving the unique DNA of our brands," John D. Idol, Capri's chief executive, said in a statement.
Tapestry said it would pour money into marketing and branding as it tied the two conglomerates together.
"The consumers should see and feel the brand as they always have, perhaps feeling a little bit more innovative and relevant as we put them on a digital platform so that they communicate," Ms. Crevoiserat said. "But they should not feel the brand differently in terms of the brand DNA."
Tapestry's stock fell nearly 16 percent on Thursday. Capri's shares soared almost 56 percent.
The deal will be financed through debt, which Tapestry could "rapidly pay down," the company's chief financial officer said in a statement. In its most recent quarter, Tapestry's net sales increased 13 percent, while Capri's revenue in its most recent quarter fell 10.5 percent.
"The potential deal comes at a time when luxury is facing something of a slowdown, especially in the North American market," noted Neil Saunders, the managing director at GlobalData, a retail consulting firm. "This has put pressure on Tapestry and Capri, both of which are now looking to international markets to bolster growth. There is more security in embarking on bold international plans as a larger entity."
The deal also gives Tapestry more cachet in the luxury market, analysts said.
"Tapestry has long eyed becoming a bona fide 'house of luxury"' similar to Kering and LVMH, said Craig Johnson, the president of the consultancy Customer Growth Partners. "But its current brands are near-luxe rather than true luxe. Capri gives Tapestry a toehold in the true luxe world, which even though Kors is by far Capri's largest brand, over time Versace may well be the real 'jewel in the crown."'
The deal was the latest in the global luxury industry in recent months. This week, the upmarket Australian fashion house Zimmerman was bought by the private equity firm Advent in a deal worth $ 1 billion. Last month, Kering said it would buy a stake in Valentino, bringing another large fashion label under its tent.
And speculation continues to swirl around a possible sale of Bergdorf Goodman to LVMH, the world's largest luxury group by sales. Bergdorf's department store on Fifth Avenue in New York is across the street from the glittering flagship boutique of Tiffany & Company, the jewelry house that LVMH bought for $ 15.8 billion in 2021.

Opera Singer And Husband Plead Guilty In Sex Crime: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The countertenor and his husband, Scott Walters, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a young singer in Houston in 2010, in a deal that will spare them jail time.
The opera star David Daniels, one of the world's leading countertenors, pleaded guilty on Friday in Houston to sexually assaulting a young singer who had attended one of his performances there in 2010.
The plea deal was announced just as the trial of Mr. Daniels, 57, and his husband, Scott Walters, 40, was about to begin.
Mr. Daniels pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual assault of an adult, a second-degree felony. He will face eight years of probation, a lifetime requirement to register as a sex offender and an order that he refrain from contact with the singer he assaulted, Samuel Schultz. He avoided a more serious charge of aggravated sexual assault, a first-degree felony, which carries harsher penalties. Mr. Walters, who was facing the same charges, pleaded guilty under similar terms. The case will be transferred to Georgia, where the couple lives.
The jury was assembled in Harris County District Court in Houston on Friday morning, and all signs indicated that the trial would soon begin, when Matt Hennessy, a lawyer representing Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters, told Judge Reagan Clark that there was a new offer that he needed to discuss with his clients.
An agreement was reached, and a little over an hour later the defendants were back in the courtroom.
Mr. Daniels initially attempted to plead no contest, but Judge Clark refused.
"It's guilty or not guilty in my courtroom," the judge said. "If you're going to plead no contest, then we are going to start hearing evidence."
Mr. Daniels, who wore a blue suit, said, "Guilty, your honor."
Soon after that Mr. Daniels exited the courtroom with Mr. Walters and moved briskly down the hall, saying he had no comment. Mr. Hennessy also declined to comment.
Mr. Daniels, who appeared on some of the world's leading stages, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York and the Royal Opera in London, is one of the most prominent classical stars to face criminal charges during the national #MeToo reckoning. His performing career has suffered since his arrest in 2019, and he was fired from his position as a tenured professor of voice at the University of Michigan in 2020.
After Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters pleaded guilty, Mr. Schultz read a victim impact statement before the court, though the news media was barred from hearing it. In a statement to The New York Times on Friday morning, he said he was pleased by the outcome.
"I am glad that the defendants have acknowledged by their guilty pleas the truth of my traumatic experience, and that this portion of my nightmarish ordeal has finally concluded," he said.
Mr. Schultz, a baritone who is now 36, was a 23-year-old graduate student at Rice University, in Houston, at the time of the encounter with Mr. Daniels. He went public with an accusation of rape in 2018 amid the #MeToo movement -- first anonymously, in an online post, and then naming Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters as his attackers in an interview with The New York Daily News.
Mr. Schultz had accused the two men of assaulting him in May 2010 after he went to hear Mr. Daniels in Handel's "Xerxes" at Houston Grand Opera. Mr. Schultz said he was introduced to Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters by a friend. After attending the performance and cast party, Mr. Schultz has said he was invited to Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters's apartment. There, he said, he was given a drink that caused him to lose consciousness. He has said that he awoke alone, naked and bleeding from the rectum.
Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters were arrested and charged with sexual assault in connection to the incident. They had previously denied the accusations, saying they had consensual sex with Mr. Schultz.
Mr. Daniels rose to fame as a countertenor, singing high parts that were once sung by castratos or mezzo-sopranos. His success helped open doors for other countertenors.

Chief Executive of Gucci Is Out Amid Declining Sales and a Shake-Up of Leadership at Kering: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fashion label's owner, the Kering group, unveiled a new roster of executives as it tries to begin a new chapter and leave the shadow of its rival, LVMH.
For years, Marco Bizzarri was one of the most well-known and respected executives in the global luxury business. Bald and boldly suited, he was the architect behind the meteoric success of Gucci, the largest fashion brand in the stable owned by the French group Kering, which also includes Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent.
But on Tuesday, after a bruising year of declining sales and the abrupt exit of Gucci's longtime creative director, Alessandro Michele, Mr. Bizzarri's departure from the fashion house after eight years as its leader was announced quietly by its parent group. The news was buried in the third paragraph of a memo Kering released that outlined a major organizational shake-up as François-Henri Pinault, the chairman and chief executive, tries to write a new chapter for the fortunes of Gucci and the conglomerate.
In the same announcement, Kering said Francesca Bellettini, the chief executive of Yves Saint Laurent, would become the conglomerate's deputy chief executive for brand development, a promotion that will require all Kering brand chief executives to report to her and make her one of the most powerful women in the luxury industry. Jean-Marc Duplaix, Kering's chief financial officer, will also become a deputy chief executive, overseeing operations and finance.
"We are building a more robust organization to fully capture the growth of the global luxury market," Mr. Pinault said in the memo. "I am confident that the changes we are announcing today will set Kering on a path to success and profitable growth over the long term."
The management reshuffle follows the group's recent purchase of the beauty brand Creed, the first big acquisition after its decision in February to create a separate beauty division -- yet another signal of Kering's plans for reinvention.
And it comes in the wake of multiple reports that Mr. Pinault is in advanced negotiations to buy a majority stake in the Hollywood talent agency CAA under the aegis of Artémis, his family investment company, which is the main shareholder in Kering. A spokesman for Mr. Pinault and Artémis declined to comment about those reports.
With Kering's buzzy labels and outsize cultural influence, a dominant industry narrative has arisen casting the conglomerate as an archrival to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the largest group in the luxury industry. But LVMH, with more than 75 luxury brands, dwarfs Kering's 14 labels in both sales revenue and market capitalization.
Lately, Kering has stumbled. Its stock performance has lagged that of key rivals like Hermes and LVMH, while several scandals and controversies inside some of the biggest Kering fashion houses have roiled the group.
Balenciaga, once the hottest brand on the fashion calendar, had a spectacular fall from grace last autumn after it was accused of promoting pedophilia in its advertising campaigns; it is still trying to regain momentum. Then there were the continuing headaches at Gucci, which generated two-thirds of Kering profits in 2021 and which, under Mr. Michele, was widely lauded for inaugurating a new era of magpie inclusivity and emotion in fashion.
However, Mr. Michele -- largely unknown in fashion until he was handpicked by Mr. Bizzarri to lead the brand -- left in November after disagreeing with management about Gucci's direction. He was replaced by Sabato De Sarno, who will show his debut collection during Milan Fashion Week in September.
The public line -- until now -- was that Mr. Bizzarri, who oversaw the growth of Gucci revenues to more than 10 billion euros from €3.89 billion, would stay on to steer the house into its next era.
Instead, he will be replaced in September by Jean-François Palus, the managing director of the Kering group, who will fill the role until a successor is found.
In an investment note, Citibank called the moves "well-thought and logical, reinforcing decision-making, governance and succession while showing further determination to transform Gucci."

America Could Learn From This Sports Talk Show: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a self-conscious recusant from the so-called prestige TV revolution, I take a certain knowing delight in telling people that the only show -- broadcast or streaming -- that I watch is "Skip and Shannon: Undisputed," a daily morning talk program on FS1, Fox's national sports channel.
"Undisputed" is not a name to conjure in the world of middlebrow television criticism. But for the 200,000 or so Americans who tune in each morning at 9:30 (6:30 in the Los Angeles studio where it is recorded), watching Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe debate sports -- and, occasionally, with a candor rarely found in other forums, politics -- is almost as important as drinking coffee.
While no official announcement has been made about the show's long-term future, Mr. Sharpe, one of the show's two main hosts along with its current moderator, Jennifer Hale, announced that he was leaving the program on last Tuesday's episode. The end of the current pairing on "Undisputed" will mean the end of my morning routine as I know it, but I would be only half-joking if I said that it will also be a loss for American culture.
Among the many charms of "Undisputed" was its reminder of what television once was, an essentially ephemeral medium with a reassuring throwaway quality. But another part of the show's appeal, I suspect, is that, intentionally or otherwise, it has become a kind of fossil record of American politics during the last seven years.
It was almost certainly the only program on television where you could watch a man wearing a goat mask and his navy-blazer-wearing debate partner screaming about whether LeBron James or Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player ever, get up during a commercial break and return to find a thoughtful discussion of the history of racism in the N.F.L.
"Undisputed" began in 2016. It pitted Mr. Bayless, a journalist who helped popularize the daytime sports-talk format on ESPN with a show called "First Take," against Mr. Sharpe, a Hall of Fame tight end who won two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos and one with the Baltimore Ravens. (The audience for the show, like that for late-night talk shows nowadays, is much larger than its ratings suggest: Millions of viewers who never watch live enjoy whole segments uploaded to YouTube or shorter clips posted on social media, and there is a podcast version.) The lyrics of its theme song, performed by Lil Wayne, a fan of Mr. Bayless who has appeared frequently as a guest, provide an apt summary of the proceedings: "No mercy, no mercy, no mercy / And I won't back down."
Many sports shows are built around the concept of two hosts with divergent views. What set "Undisputed" apart is that the hosts were a true odd couple -- a white cantankerous journalist and a Black superstar athlete -- who nonetheless found a way to discuss everything from the longevity of the Lakers dynasty and the follies of the Cleveland Browns to the #MeToo movement, Covid lockdowns, illegal drugs, the rise of legal sports gambling and the protests and riots that followed the murder of George Floyd. It worked as television because the two men were willing to discuss these issues with an almost reckless lack of restraint, seemingly in ignorance of the self-censorship that pervades so much polite discourse.
In an early episode of the show in 2016, Lil Wayne appeared to discuss the national anthem protests led by Colin Kaepernick and other N.F.L. players. Citing his popularity among white teenagers, the rapper said that he had "never dealt with racism" and that he considered it a phenomenon that belonged to America's past. This is not a perspective that has much cultural purchase on NPR or CNN, but it is shared by millions of Americans. Even for those who find it absurd, it has a kind of dialectical value: It is the beginning rather than the end of a conversation. That is the spirit in which Mr. Sharpe responded to it, saying that while his own experience as an African American growing up in rural Georgia had been very different, he was glad that Lil Wayne was being honest about his experiences.
Throughout their exchange, Mr. Bayless asked occasional questions but seemed mostly content to listen. A self-described "God and country guy," Mr. Bayless is often considered a mouthpiece for older, tradition-minded sports fans, but his own views are somewhat less predictable. (In an interview he once referred to himself jokingly as a communist.) In a later segment of the show devoted to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's opposition to Mr. Kaepernick's protest (which the justice had called "dumb and disrespectful"), Mr. Bayless admitted that, like Justice Ginsburg, he was uncomfortable with kneeling during the anthem -- but said that he had changed his mind after hearing the players' reasoning.
A similar open-mindedness characterized the show's handling of the George Floyd protests. In 2020, Drew Brees, then the quarterback of the New Orleans Saints, responded to the news of Mr. Floyd's death by saying that he opposed protesting police brutality if doing so involved "disrespecting the flag" by kneeling during the national anthem. Mr. Sharpe suggested on air that Mr. Brees should retire from football, arguing that anyone so blithely insensitive could not be an effective leader in a locker room in which the majority of players were African American.
Mr. Brees responded by contacting Mr. Sharpe, and the two had a wide-ranging phone conversation about race and American history whose contents Mr. Sharpe later shared on air. This included Mr. Sharpe's comment to Mr. Brees that given Mr. Brees's charitable work in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, "no white quarterback in the history of the N.F.L. has had Black support like you got it," which, in Mr. Sharpe's view, had made Mr. Brees's comments especially painful. Mr. Brees later made a public apology and even took a knee during the national anthem with his teammates. (Months later, when Mr. Brees announced his actual retirement, no reference was made on "Undisputed" to his earlier comments, and both hosts showered him with superlatives. It is difficult to imagine such graciousness in other media settings.)
Unlike popular podcasts such as "Pardon My Take," which is essentially sports comedy, or TV shows such as "The Herd" on FS1, whose host Colin Cowherd aspires to disinterested analysis of sports, "Undisputed" was premised explicitly upon antagonism, in this case between its hosts. Even their ongoing bets, wagering cases of Diet Mountain Dew, and their elaborate visual jokes -- Mr. Sharpe bringing a bottle of Hennessy and Black and Mild cigars to celebrate the Eagles beating the Patriots in Super Bowl LII and Mr. Bayless affectionately nuzzling a Cowboys jersey -- were attempts at one-upmanship calculated to annoy each other.
This high-spirited raillery was very much a part of the appeal of "Undisputed" (there is a whole genre of YouTube video compilations of Mr. Sharpe's agonized cries of "Skiiiiiiiiiiiip!"), but during the show's long run it also led to occasional displays of genuine animosity. On one episode last year, for instance, Mr. Bayless accused his partner of envying Tom Brady's longevity in the N.F.L. and made light of Mr. Sharpe's own achievements as a player. Mr. Sharpe, who seemed astonished at the ad hominem nature of the argument, removed his glasses with a look of genuine woundedness. In another episode, a disagreement about the N.F.L.'s decision to postpone the conclusion of a Buffalo Bills game after a player collapsed on the field led to a similar altercation, in which Mr. Sharpe suggested his partner should remove a tweet he considered offensive and Mr. Bayless said that he would not do so because he had not changed his opinion. Such incidents were inevitable. Candor has its price.
When I first read reports earlier this month of Mr. Sharpe's impending departure from the show, I felt dejected, as if a beloved relation had announced that he was going into exile abroad. While it is hard at present to say what motivated "Unc" (as fans have styled him) to leave, I, for one, hope that it is not resentment of his longtime debate partner, as some commentators have speculated. In the final segment of Tuesday's episode Mr. Sharpe thanked Mr. Bayless -- along with dozens of makeup artists, front desk staff members, schedulers and security personnel -- with tears in his eyes.
I too am grateful. In addition to showing me that the debate about whether Bill Belichick or Tom Brady contributed more to the Patriots' six Super Bowl victories can never be settled, Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Bayless have taught me a great many other things in their heedless, unsophisticated way that I could not have learned from watching "Succession" or "The White Lotus": that a stray remark, however churlish, need not mean a permanent asterisk next to a name, that forthright conversation begun from opposing premises can, in fact, lead to increased understanding, and that old-fashioned virtues such as forgiveness and liberality still have a place, alongside shouting and friendly wagers, in American life.

Airman Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges in Leaks Case: [Correction]

Full text: The judge rejected a request to reconsider his earlier decision to hold Jack Teixeira without bail indefinitely.
Jack Teixeira, the 21-year-old Air National Guardsman accused of posting a trove of secret documents to an online chat group, pleaded not guilty to six counts of federal criminal charges on Wednesday, two months after his arrest.
Airman Teixeira, appearing in an orange prison uniform and fresh buzz cut, sat quietly as a federal magistrate judge read him his rights before standing to say, "Not guilty, your honor," during a 10-minute hearing in Worcester, Mass., attended by his family and dozens of media outlets.
His lawyer asked the judge, David H. Hennessy, to reconsider an earlier decision to hold Airman Teixeira without bail indefinitely. But the judge rejected the request, saying that the circumstances have not changed since the Justice Department successfully argued that the airman's history of violent threats and leaking made freeing him an unacceptable risk.
His next court date, a conference to discuss the status of the case, was scheduled for early August. The next important legal benchmark will be the selection of a trial judge, who will set a trial timetable -- if the two sides do not reach a plea agreement first, as has often happened in recent cases involving the illegal disclosure of government documents.
Last week, a federal grand jury indicted Airman Teixeira, who was given a top security clearance while assigned to an intelligence unit at an Air Force base on Cape Cod, on six counts of retaining and transmitting classified national defense information. If convicted, he could face up to 60 years in prison and $ 1.5 million in fines.
The indictment said Airman Teixeira mishandled documents including a report on the hacking of an unnamed U.S. company's accounts by "a foreign adversary," information about the provision and delivery of military equipment to Ukraine and a highly sensitive report on Russian and Ukrainian troop movements that might have compromised "classified sources and methods."
Other documents included details of a foreign plot to target U.S. troops abroad that described "where and how" an assault might take place, the indictment said.
Some of the materials that Airman Teixeira is accused of posting online bore the most highly restricted classification markings, including "sensitive compartmented information" that could be stored and reviewed only in a protected facility.
The case involves references to numerous classified documents and procedures, which has already led to delays, as both the prosecution and defense teams secure the proper security clearances needed to review evidence, or even to interview Airman Teixeira.
On Wednesday, the prosecution said it was working to resolve issues related to releasing discovery material to Michael Bachrach, a lawyer for Airman Teixeira based in New York, as quickly as possible.
Airman Teixeira's lawyers have argued in court that their client naïvely believed that the material he shared with fellow users on Discord, a social media platform popular with gamers, would not be further disseminated, even though some of his online friends lived in foreign countries.
He smiled and greeted family members seated together in the corner of the courtroom.
"We remain as committed as ever and our entire family continues to share complete and unwavering support of Jack as he faces this matter," Jen Reed, a representative of Airman Teixeira and his family, said in an emailed statement. "We realize there is a long road ahead."
Airman Teixeira's lawyers did not respond to reporters' questions as they left the fifth-floor courtroom.

Ivan Menezes, 63, Chief Executive Who Made Fusty Johnnie Walker Cool: [Biography]

Full text: As chief executive of Diageo for a decade, he presented alcohol as an attainable luxury and helped brands like Smirnoff and Guinness grow.
Ivan Menezes, who as chief executive of the spirits corporation Diageo used his canny understanding of the drinking public to help the company grow into a global colossus, died on June 7 in London. He was 63.
The cause was complications of emergency surgery for a stomach ulcer, a Diageo spokesman said.
Diageo is omnipresent in the world of alcohol, selling more than 200 brands in more than 180 countries, including Smirnoff vodka, Tanqueray gin, Johnnie Walker Scotch, Captain Morgan rum and Guinness beer. In some spirit categories it has the largest global net sales.
Mr. Menezes (pronounced muh-NAY-zess) was trained in marketing and closely studied consumer sentiment. To him, spirits provided what he called "accessible luxury" to customers -- a dram of the good life even in an unstable economy.
"The example I like to use is, if you are an average New Yorker, it may be tough to spend a night at the Four Seasons," Mr. Menezes said in an interview with The New York Times in 2005, "but you could walk into the Four Seasons bar and enjoy a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue Label on the rocks."
Mr. Menezes, who became chief executive in 2013, was at Diageo from its inception. He was Guinness's strategy director in 1997 when the company merged with Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., which owned Burger King and Pillsbury, creating a conglomerate reportedly worth $ 33 billion.
After the merger, he became global marketing director for the company's beverage division in 1998.
One of his first challenges was making Johnnie Walker appeal to a new generation. It was not so much that young imbibers disliked the taste of blended Scotch, but rather that the drink's traditional tartan image felt fusty, Diageo's market research found.
"We are losing older drinkers by the bucketful, but only gaining new ones by the thimbleful," Mr. Menezes was quoted as saying in 1999 in the Scottish newspaper The Scotsman. "We will all benefit from everyone focusing on building brands and making their brands relevant to younger consumers."
That year Mr. Menezes spent 100 million pounds (about $ 224 million in today's dollars) to revamp Johnnie Walker's image with an international advertising campaign developed by the agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty.
The campaign introduced the slogan "Keep walking" and featured three television advertisements, including one in which the actor Harvey Keitel walked into a coliseum filled with lions as he talked about overcoming stage fright; another showed the French funambulist Ramon Kelvink walking a tightrope between buildings.
"With this campaign, we hope to build an emotional bond with the consumer through the universal territory of inspiring personal progress," Mr. Menezes told Campaign magazine.
A quarter-century later, Johnnie Walker, one of the most popular Scotch brands on the planet, still uses the "Keep walking" tagline. Diageo said that Johnnie Walker's retail sales value had increased from about $ 5.1 billion in 2012 to more than $ 8 billion in 2022.
Under Mr. Menezes, Diageo expanded its tequila offerings, trading its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand to Casa Cuervo in 2014 in exchange for complete control of its Don Julio tequila brand and $ 408 million in cash. The company also bought Casamigos, the tequila brand created by George Clooney and two friends, Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman, in a deal in 2017 worth up to $ 1 billion. Tequila is now the company's second-largest seller, after Scotch.
As chief executive Mr. Menezes removed a layer of regional management, facilitating communication between the global company and country-based businesses and shrinking its employee base from about 36,000 to nearly 28,000. He was credited with reducing Diageo's carbon emissions and pushing for greater work force diversity by adding more women at top levels. He had planned to retire this year; the new chief executive is Debra Crew.
She takes the helm as the company faces a recent lawsuit filed by Sean Combs, the rapper known as Diddy, who has accused the company of racial bias for neglecting the vodka and tequila brands they co-own. Diageo denied Mr. Combs's allegations, saying in a statement that "we are confident the facts will show that he has been treated fairly."
Ivan Manuel Menezes was born on July 10, 1959, in Pune, India, to Nina and Manuel Menezes. His mother taught music and French; his father was chairman of the Indian Railway Board.
After graduating from St. Mary's High School in Mount Abu, India, Mr. Menezes earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1979 from St. Stephen's College, the University of Delhi.
He then studied business policy and marketing at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and took a job with Nestlé in New Delhi in 1981.
He moved to the United States to study business administration at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, completing his master's degree in 1985. He then took a job as a business and management consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton, based in Chicago and London.
Mr. Menezes was vice president of group marketing for Whirlpool in northern Italy from 1992 until he left for Guinness in 1997.
He held several other positions at Diageo, including chief operating officer and president of the company's North American operations, before succeeding Paul S. Walsh as chief executive.
He is survived by his wife, Shibani, with whom he lived in London; two brothers, Victor, the former chairman and chief executive of Citibank, and Michael; a sister, Marisa; a daughter, Rohini Menezes; and a son, Nikhil.
Mr. Menezes, who was a British and American citizen as well as an overseas citizen of India, was knighted by King Charles III in January for his services to business and equality.
When it came to his own taste in beverages, Mr. Menezes preferred classics like a Johnnie Walker Black and soda, or a pint of Guinness, though, as he said during an appearance on CNBC on St. Patrick's Day in 2007, sometimes one was not enough.
"What I will say about Guinness," he said, "my favorite pint is always my next pint."

Places to Go Whole Hog (or Fish or Fowl): [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Looking for nonalcoholic drinks beyond seltzer? You're in luck.
Unofficial summer is officially underway. I'm looking forward to eating outdoors as much as humanly possible before it gets unbearably hot. (I'm a summer agnostic.) That said, it's reader question time and, as usual, my inbox was full of thoughtful and fun requests, including where to go for large-format dining, where to find carciofi alla giudia (Jewish-style artichokes) and where to have great nonalcoholic drinks.
As always, please email your questions to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see them answered in a future newsletter.
Duck, Pig or Sea Bass?
One of our favorite things to do with friends is to go out to eat where fixed-menu, family-style dining is offered. We recently ate at Momofuku Ssam Bar for the pork shoulder dinner. Can you recommend some other restaurants that offer this type of experience? -- Joy W.
Francie, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has a whole roast duck for $ 135 that's presented with various flora before it's carved up. It's definitely worth ordering if you can afford it, especially for the soppressata jam that, I agree with Pete Wells, is good enough to lick off "a stack of junk mail." Peasant, in NoLIta, will serve you a family-style whole pig roast with antipasti, sides and dessert for $ 125 per person, given at least four days' notice and provided there are six or more people in your party. And Monsieur Vo, in the East Village, has a few big-format dishes, including a whole sea bass that's market-price, and the Monsieur Platter ( $ 48), which includes four types of meat skewers with the option to add more, as well as sides like vermicelli and roasted peanuts that you then assemble into your own bites. We call that fun with food.
Finding Carciofi alla Giudia
Just spent a week in Rome where I fell in love with Roman artichokes, Jewish-style. Ate them several times that week. Where can I find them in N.Y.C.? -- Lisa S.
I ate this exact type of deep-fried artichoke spritzed with lemon juice and dressed with mint and red chile flakes at Bottino, in Chelsea, a few weeks ago. The occasion? My sister's wedding! Talk about kismet. They're also on the menu at Macosa Trattoria, a small-but-mighty Italian restaurant in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that I mentioned a few months ago.
Not-Boring Nonalcoholic Beverages
As I have recently had to stop drinking alcohol for health reasons, I was hoping you can send me to the restaurants with the most creative nonalcoholic beverage programs. I can drink only so much sparkling water! -- Ira L.
I wasn't quite sure if you were looking for nonalcoholic drinks that were mimicking cocktails, or just very creative nonalcoholic drinks. So, I have recommendations for both. I see the phony Negroni from the Brooklyn distiller St. Agrestis on a ton of menus and, as a Negroni obsessive, I endorse it as an alterative. El Quijote has a version of the restaurant's famous sangria that's cheekily called Santa Sangre, as well as a G + T without the G. And the eternally excellent Gramercy Tavern has nonalcoholic red wine and a nonalcoholic cocktail list that's four options deep, including two seasonal spritzes (strawberry-rhubarb and green apple-fennel at the moment).
In the category of creative drinks, there's abcV, Jean-Georges's health-leaning restaurant in the Flatiron district. Between bites of your mushroom-walnut Bolognese, you can sip on any number of "juices, tonics and vibrations." I'd choose Root Reboot because lemon and ginger are my life, though a pollen shake might be the best way to toast the dustiest spring ever. Or if you'd really prefer to have some pork al pastor, Atla, in NoHo, has six agua frescas that range from the traditional hibiscus to a more experimental yuzu avocado.
In Other News ...
The dream of top-tier Peking duck is alive and well at Juqi, the Beijing-based chain with a new location in Flushing, Queens. In his review, Pete Wells writes that the restaurant pulls off "all the fine points of roasting, carving and serving -- so consistently and satisfyingly."
Openings: The Migrant Kitchen, known for its eclectic mix of cuisines, will start serving lamb torta and esquites hot dogs at Ballfields Café in Central Park; the Golden Swan has taken over the space that once housed the Spotted Pig, in the West Village; and Hand Hospitality is back at it again with Moono, a more casual project from the chef behind the Michelin-starred restaurant Jua.
Kim Severson delivered a deep dive on what restaurant hospitality looks like after the pandemic and labor shortages devastated the industry.
Should you find yourself in southern New Mexico any time soon, consider stopping by Chope's Town Bar & Cafe, the family-run restaurant with a beloved (and closely guarded) recipe for chile con queso, Maggie Hennessy reports.
Here is how Zouheir Louhaichy, the head maître d' at Balthazar, spends his Sundays.
Nicholas Gray, the founder of the popular hot-dog stand Gray's Papaya, died May 19 at the age of 86.

For a Chile Con Queso Like No Other: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: At Chope's Town Bar & Cafe, one family has closely guarded a recipe that makes the most of the region's beloved chiles.
The chile con queso you know best may be a jar of tomato- and chile-flecked processed cheese. But it can also be a thing of unparalleled beauty, a deliciously messy, fiery, thin salsa capped with molten cheese meant to be pinched with fresh tortillas.
You may not learn about this version until you visit southern New Mexico -- home to the famous, long green Hatch chiles -- and start asking around about where to eat.
"Have you been to Chope's?" the locals say. "You gotta try their chile con queso."
Recipe: Chile con Queso
Located in the small farming community of La Mesa, N.M., about 20 miles south of Las Cruces, the state's second-largest city, Chope's Town Bar & Cafe comprises two buildings on a gravel lot along Highway 28: a 19th-century adobe home turned restaurant, which opened in 1909, and a whitewashed bar that opened 40 years later.
Inside the bar, families, farmers and leather-clad bikers chat over the jukebox, which plays a mix of '80s rock and thumping reggaeton. The chile con queso is deceptively monochromatic, a white bowl filled with melted white Cheddar and served alongside warm, foil-wrapped flour tortillas. Customers tear off bits of tortilla and plunge them through the thick cheese layer to unearth diced roasted chiles simmered in their own tangy, spicy liquor.
"That's the traditional Mexican preparation style," said Josefina Garcilazo, Chope's head chef, in Spanish. She represents just a handful of people who have been entrusted with this 80-year-old recipe, which dates to the family's forebears in Copper Canyon, Mexico.
"Queso Velveeta is," she said, "gringo."
Ms. Garcilazo works from a small galley kitchen inside the restaurant, ‌ the former home of its founders, Longina and Margarito Benavides. They named Chope's after their son, José ‌Benavides, nicknamed Chope for his uniform of overalls, or chopos. Chope Benavides and his wife, Lupe, the originator of the chile con queso recipe, took over in the 1940s. Their daughters, Margarita Martinez, Amelia Rivas and Cecilia Yañez, now own the restaurant.
D.J. Martinez, Ms. Martinez's son and a fourth-generation manager with his brother Michael Martinez, said he feels as duty bound to safeguard his grandmother's recipe, as he does Chope's thick-battered chiles rellenos and sturdy enchiladas.
To him, they're more than just recipes.
"Do you know what sazón means?" Mr. Martinez said. "Sazón means, like, the culture, the tradition, and the style of cooking all come together and create the flavor. That's kind of what it means; that's why it tastes so good."
An El Paso native, the chef John Lewis grew up eating at Chope's, a straight shot up Interstate 10, every other Saturday. And every meal began with queso. "Chope's version exactly translates to how it's read: It's chiles with cheese." He has tinkered with the simple dish for years and now serves a version at his New Mexican restaurant, Rancho Lewis, in Charleston, S.C.
Chope's chile con queso starts with meaty, Anaheim-esque Joe E. Parker green chiles, which are grown and roasted in Las Cruces and Hatch -- the center of chile production in New Mexico. Mariana Amaya, an assistant cook who has worked at Chope's for 35 years, peels and dices them before simmering them -- perhaps with chicken stock or onions?
Ms. Amaya makes all of Chope's salsas, including three five-gallon containers per day of the base for its chile con queso and chili con carne. She is the caretaker of an industrial grater that's also been here for 35 years, on which she grinds 50-pound blocks of white Cheddar daily before heaping a towering pile atop each bowl of salsa, the same way she has for decades.
"The cook is what makes the chile con queso special," Ms. Amaya said, in Spanish. "I love my job."

Full text: As the newest Staten Island ferry grumbled across New York Harbor the other day, you could easily imagine the woman for whom it is named in contemplation by a window. Her dress plain, her white hair in a braided crown, her eyes seeking the divine in the green-gray waters.
THE Dorothy Day, for angular woman and massive vessel both.
The city ferries that provide free passage between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan are often christened after Staten Islanders of note: a high school football coach, a long-serving politician, a soldier killed in war. But no single descriptive fully captures Day, who died at 83 in 1980.
Journalist, reformer, anarchist, peace activist, Roman Catholic convert, co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement -- and, perhaps, saint; the Vatican has declared her a "servant of God," an initial step toward canonization. She is buried on Staten Island, where her religious conversion had taken root during solitary walks along its southern shores.
But solitude was not possible for last month's celebration of the Dorothy Day ferry's inaugural run. The large gathering at St. George Terminal in Staten Island included city officials and Catholic clerics, blue-uniformed officers and gray-haired pacifists, those sworn to uphold the law and those familiar with breaking it, at least in the name of civil disobedience.
Among them was Martha Hennessy, 67, whose long white hair and long history of peace activism evoked her grandmother, Dorothy Day. Ms. Hennessy served nearly a year in prison for trespassing onto a submarine base in Georgia to participate in a symbolic, nonviolent protest against nuclear weapons.
"I'm a convicted felon," said Ms. Hennessy, who had made a batch of chocolate-chip cookies for the day's half-hour journey.
Through the mix of brochures handed out before the ceremony -- this one about city ferries, that one about Day's potential canonization -- the secular and the sacred met. Combined, they provided a glimpse of Day's life.
How she settled in a Staten Island cottage in 1924 and two years later gave birth to a daughter, Tamar. How her embrace of Catholicism helped to end her common-law marriage to a biologist who rejected religion. How she and the social activist Peter Maurin founded the Catholic Worker, the radical lay movement committed to mercy, justice and providing hospitality to all in need.
How she remained a steadfast pacifist, protested against nuclear armament and was repeatedly jailed, the last time after picketing with striking farm workers in California, when she was 75. How she struggled with her flaws, doubts and depression, but kept a charted course.
"We have all known the long loneliness, and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes in community," she once wrote.
The ceremony included those obligatory forms of a municipal blessing -- speeches -- including one by the city's transportation commissioner, Ydanis Rodriguez. He emphasized that Day's call to treat every human being with "dignity and respect" included immigrants and workers.
"This is about more than riding a ferry," Mr. Rodriguez, who was born in the Dominican Republic, said. "It's to continue fighting for justice."
Soon the Filthy Rotten System band was leading choruses of "If I Had a Hammer," to the slight consternation of transportation officials worried about ferry schedules. But eventually the gates opened and the Dorothy Day, bedecked with red-white-and-blue bunting, received passengers for its first voyage to Manhattan.
The vessel shuddered, as if shaking off the shackles of land, and pulled away.
It will remain once of the eternal mysteries what Day might have made of an $ 85 million, 4,500-passenger ferry named after her.
Would she have given that withering "look" of hers, suggesting she had no time for such nonsense? Would she have repeated the famous admonition often attributed to her? ("Don't call me a saint. I don't want to be dismissed that easily.")
Or would she have welcomed the moment as an opportunity to promote peace, nuclear disarmament and the message to love one another?
Now, several afternoons after its inaugural run, the Dorothy Day was taking its turn as just another one of the orange-and-blue behemoths that depart from St. George Terminal nearly 60 times a day. Gone was all the bunting, and the brackish waters had begun to streak the new windows.
The gate at the stern rose up and the 320-foot-long Dorothy Day groaned free from its wood-slatted berth. It rumbled into the harbor, where buoys bobbed, freighters glided and the impossible Manhattan skyline defined the horizon.
On the upper and middle decks, dozens of tourists had secured positions for the best views of the Statue of Liberty, still only a copper-green smudge in the distance. But on the lower deck, regulars seemed to have taken their places on benches. Some nodded off, some studied their cellphones and some lost themselves in the mesmerizing waters, just as Day once did.
For more than a half-century, she had lived intermittently on Staten Island, where she found space to decompress from the demands of editing The Catholic Worker newspaper and living in the Catholic Worker community on the Lower East Side -- there are many dozen communities around the world -- where she helped to provide food, housing and other services.
In the winter of 1927, for example, Day boarded the ferry to Staten Island and, as Paul Elie recounted in his book "The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage," sat on the deck and wrote in her journal. The waters were restless, the air foggy, her mind troubled.
"A most consuming restlessness was upon me so that I walked around and around the deck of the ferry, almost groaning in anguish of spirit," she later wrote. "Perhaps the devil was on the boat."
Two days later, Day went to a Catholic church in Staten Island's Tottenville section and was baptized.
As Elie wrote, the ferry ride for Day could be "at once a retreat and a pilgrimage." She breathed in the salt-scented air, imagined the far-off destinations of passing ships, felt the anxieties of urban life wash away. The ferry induced meditation.
On another ferry ride, in 1950, Day jotted down her thoughts: "The trip is so beautiful. The sky and water is so lovely in all its moods that I often find myself just thinking, and thinking 'to the point' on what has been going on down below the surface of my mind."
Now, on this ferry gliding across New York's Upper Bay, you could almost see Dorothy Day by the window, apart from and a part of the waterborne crowd, taking in the awesome ordinary.
That harried man hurriedly eating a sloppy sandwich. Those sea gulls dodging and darting in the ferry's wake. That mother chasing after her toddling toddler. Those two boys speaking in Spanish about their video game. The hum of the engines felt in the feet. The dance of the churning-white waters.
Unreal Manhattan became real as the Dorothy Day eased into its berth at Whitehall Terminal. Bells sounded, gates lowered and we made our way to solid ground, saints and sinners all.

Full text: The apparent leak by the airman, Jack Teixeira, was "a profound breach" of his vow to protect sensitive information when he received his security clearance, a federal magistrate judge said.
Jack Teixeira, the 21-year-old Air Force National Guardsman accused of posting a trove of secret documents online, will remain in prison pending his trial because he poses a continuing threat to national security and public safety, a federal magistrate judge ruled on Friday.
The judge, David H. Hennessy, cited Airman Teixeira's history of seeking out and posting classified intelligence materials in defiance of his superiors at an Air Force base on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, in denying his request to be released on bond into the custody of his father.
Airman Teixeira's actions were "a profound breach" of his vow to protect sensitive information when he received his security clearance, Judge Hennessy said during a 45-minute hearing at the federal courthouse in Worcester, Mass. His ruling came after the government said the airman continued to have access to sensitive intelligence months after his superiors noted his suspicious behavior.
"Who did he put at risk?" Judge Hennessy said, after the defense team played down the possibility he would leak new information. "I mean, you could make a list as long as a phone book."
Airman Teixeira, wearing an orange prison uniform and sporting a buzz cut, seemed to be in an upbeat mood when he entered the courtroom, smiling and greeting his family. But his demeanor appeared to darken after the magistrate made his ruling, and he left the hearing with a somber, glassy-eyed expression.
The decision was a victory for the government, which is seeking to send the strongest possible message to potential leakers after a humiliating disclosure of national security secrets that appears to have been pulled off by a boastful young man trying to impress his online friends.
The government had also argued that it was too dangerous to release Airman Teixeira into his community outside Boston, presenting evidence that he had made racist and violent threats. A review of thousands of posts on the social media platform Discord this month by The New York Times revealed that the airman had expressed fascination with mass shootings, conspiracy theories and weapons.
The judge said he believed the airman, who was found with a small arsenal of handguns and semiautomatic rifles near his bed at his home, had an "unhealthy fascination" with firearms, as expressed in his writings and posts.
"The danger he poses to the community is a grave one," Judge Hennessy added.
Airman Teixeira's two court-appointed lawyers, who had argued unsuccessfully that he posed a minimal risk if released, did not respond to questions from reporters.
Airman Teixeira's family expressed disappointment with the ruling. "Jack's well-being and safety is our priority right now," the family wrote in an email sent by a spokeswoman. "As a family, we are as committed as ever and remain steadfast and determined in our complete support of Jack as we continue to wade through this process."
The judge expressed disgust at Airman Teixeira's disclosure of national security secrets, and said it was plausible that he might divulge additional intelligence to foreign governments in the future. But he also displayed sympathy, even admiration, for Airman Teixeira's parents for standing by their son and offering to leverage their financial future to pay for his release.
"His family ties, in my sense, are remarkable," Judge Hennessy added.
Federal prosecutors disclosed late Wednesday that the airman's superiors had missed opportunities to limit his access to the secrets about the Ukraine war he brazenly shared with people from around the world who subscribed to three chat groups on Discord.
Air Force officials caught Airman Teixeira taking notes and conducting deep-dive searches for classified material months before he was charged with leaking a vast trove of government secrets, but did not remove him from his job, according to a court filing.
On two occasions in September and October 2022, Airman Teixeira's superiors in the Massachusetts Air National Guard admonished him after reports that he had taken "concerning actions" while handling classified information.
Those included stuffing a note into his pocket after reviewing secret information inside his unit, according to the court filing.
The airman's superiors also ordered him to "cease and desist on any deep dives into classified intelligence information," although it is not clear how, or if, they enforced that directive.
In a third incident earlier this year, one of his superiors urged him "to focus on his own career duties and not to seek out intelligence products."
Two of Airman Teixeira's superiors at the 102nd Intelligence Wing on Cape Cod have been suspended pending completion of an internal investigation by the Air Force inspector general, said a spokeswoman for the service, Ann Stefanek. Their access to classified information has been temporarily blocked, she added.
Now that Airman Teixeira has been ordered detained, his case will most likely be assigned to a different federal judge, in Boston. There remains a remote possibility that lawyers with the Justice Department's national security division will request the case be moved to a court in Northern Virginia, which includes the Pentagon, but that is increasingly unlikely, people with knowledge of the situation said.
The next major step is likely to be the filing of a grand jury indictment, which would include a much more detailed narrative of the allegations against Airman Teixeira, including an accounting of the charges he will face. Prosecutors have already suggested the charges could result in a prison sentence of at least 25 years.

How About the Best Two Out of Three?: [Review]

Full text: Even the trash talk in a remake of the 1992 street ball comedy has no spark, despite the best efforts of Sinqua Walls and Jack Harlow.
The 1992 sports comedy "White Men Can't Jump," written and directed by Ron Shelton, was a cheeky, provocative film that took a raucously skewed view of race relations and street ball. It's a well-liked film, but not so immortal that the prospect of a remake would inspire thoughts of sacrilege.
So this film, directed by Calmatic from a script by Kenya Barris and Doug Hall, feels less like a desecration than a missed opportunity. And as missed opportunities go, it's pretty serious.
The pickup basketball partners here are the rapper Jack Harlow as Jeremy, who is white, and the actor Sinqua Walls as Kamal, who is Black. Kamal was a promising high-school player whose downfall is revealed through gradual flashbacks. Jeremy has two blown-out knees, a painkiller addiction and a burgeoning reputation as a con artist. Both have the standard-issue "strong women" in their lives, and both are constant disappointments to these women.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the 1992 picture, lead actors Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes were animated enough to make you believe they could leap right out of the frame. Their female foil was played by Rosie Perez, and her subplot -- involving her becoming a contestant on the TV quiz show "Jeopardy!" -- was one of the film's many quirky delights.
This version has little quirk and less spark. While Harlow is a game and capable comedic performer up to a point -- he demonstrated as much when he hosted "Saturday Night Live" last year -- he doesn't have Harrelson's near-anarchic unpredictability. And Walls, while appealing, can't get within striking distance of Snipes' intensity.
The script by Barris and Hall, both veterans of the television sitcom "black-ish," does the actors no favors. A scene in which Jeremy brings a bottle of Hennessy brandy to Kamal's kid's birthday party, hoping to show off his "authenticity" with respect to Black tastes in booze, is meant to be funny. One could see how it might be; but it falls awkwardly flat. And try this on for exposition: "My girl's a crazy talented choreographer who's wasting her time teaching classes at a dance studio because my income's so shaky right now." Thanks for the update, Jeremy.
Near the end of the movie, Kamal's father, Benji, played by the spectacularly talented Lance Reddick, has to deliver this stilted line to his son from a hospital bed: "My biggest regret is not giving you the tools to work through your problems."
The supposed trash talk that Kamal and Jeremy exchange throughout, sometimes good-naturedly and sometimes in earnest, is similarly uninspired. By the time we get to the second half of the narrative, the movie has abandoned the sometimes near-screwball comedy of the Shelton film and pivoted to triumph-over-adversity drama, complete with big-money games the duo can't resist, despite the odds against them. The basketball action is similar to the script, that is, indifferently staged and shot. This movie not only doesn't jump, it barely gets off the couch.
White Men Can't Jump

Airman Accused of Leak Has a 'Troubling' History: [National Desk]

Full text: Prosecutors accused Jack Teixeira of trying to cover up his actions and described a possible propensity toward violence.
WASHINGTON -- Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of posting classified documents online, repeatedly tried to obstruct federal investigators and has a "troubling" history of making racist and violent remarks, Justice Department lawyers said in a court filing late Wednesday.
In an 18-page memo, released before a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday in a Massachusetts federal court, the department's lawyers argued that Airman Teixeira needed to be detained indefinitely because he posed a "serious flight risk" and might still have information that would be of "tremendous value to hostile nation states."
Airman Teixeira tapped into vast reservoirs of sensitive information, an amount that "far exceeds what has been publicly disclosed" so far, they wrote.
Prosecutors pointedly questioned Airman Teixeira's overall state of mind, disclosing that he was suspended from high school in 2018 for alarming comments about the use of Molotov cocktails and other weapons, and trawled the internet for information about mass shootings. He engaged in "regular discussions about violence and murder" on the same social media platform, Discord, that he used to post classified information, the filing said, and he surrounded his bed at his parents' house with firearms and tactical gear.
Airman Teixeira was also prone to making "racial threats," prosecutors said.
This behavior -- so disturbing it was flagged by local police when he applied for a firearms identification card -- is certain to raise new questions about how Airman Teixeira obtained a top-secret security clearance that gave him access to some of the country's most sensitive intelligence reports.
Mr. Teixeira's court-appointed lawyers dismissed the claim that he would be in a flight risk, and proposed that he be released on a $ 20,000 bond to his family's custody, in a response filed several hours before the hearing.
The episode in high school took place during his sophomore year and was never repeated, they said. The lawyers also played down the idea that he would have an opportunity to turn information over to the United States' enemies.
The government provided "little more than speculation that a foreign adversary will seduce Mr. Teixeira and orchestrate his clandestine escape from the United States," they wrote.
His legal team also offered a fleeting first glimpse at possible defense arguments, claiming that the government has not offered proof Mr. Teixeira ever intended for the information posted to a private social media server "to be widely disseminated."
Mr. Teixeira's lawyers described him as compliant -- and said he sat on the porch reading a Bible as he waited to be arrested -- but the government painted a starkly different picture.
In arguing for his confinement, prosecutors described a panicked effort by Airman Teixeira to cover up his actions as law enforcement closed in, including telling a member of a chat group to "delete all messages," and instructing a user to stonewall investigators.
He also tried to destroy evidence, prosecutors said. The filing includes a series of photos of electronic equipment, including a tablet and an Xbox console, that he hurriedly smashed, then tossed in a dumpster near his home in North Dighton, Mass., before his arrest this month. A witness told the government that he threw his phone out the window of his truck as he was driving.
"These efforts appeared calculated to delay or prevent the government from gaining a full understanding of the seriousness and scale of his conduct," the department wrote. "Any promise by the defendant to stay home or to refrain from compounding the harm that he has already caused is worth no more than his broken promises to protect classified national defense information."
Airman Teixeira was arrested on April 13, and charged with two separate counts related to the unauthorized handling of classified materials. The government has yet to seek an indictment before a grand jury, although prosecutors said in their filing on Wednesday that he could face 25 years -- "and potentially far more" -- in prison if convicted.
In a preliminary complaint unsealed after he was taken into custody, Airman Teixeira was accused of abusing his top secret clearance with an intelligence unit on Cape Cod to post documents bearing restrictive classification markings to a 50-member chat group on Discord.
Shortly before signing off in March, Airman Teixeira told a member of the small group he "was very happy" to share intelligence very few people get to see and solicited requests for information they wanted him to post, prosecutors said late Wednesday.
The material, some obtained through keyword searches of government files, was eventually distributed more widely. The trove of documents made public revealed the access Western intelligence agencies have to internal Kremlin deliberations, while baring concerns of the strained U.S.-led alliance trying to contain Russian aggression without prompting a wider conflict.
Last week, The New York Times reported that Airman Teixeira, who worked as a computer network specialist, had been sharing sensitive information far earlier than previously known and to a much larger group. According to online posts reviewed by The Times, he had begun doing so in February 2022, within 48 hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to a chat group of about 600 members.
The filing provided little insight into what prompted Airman Teixeira to leak internal U.S. intelligence assessments, but it cast his actions, which had previously been seen as mainly motivated by his desire to show off to younger friends online, in a somewhat darker light.
Investigators found a small arsenal in his bedroom at the house he shared with his mother and stepfather. Inside a gun locker two feet from his bed, law enforcement officials found multiple weapons, including handguns, bolt-action rifles, shotguns, an AK-style high-capacity weapon and a gas mask. F.B.I. special agents also found ammunition, tactical pouches and what appeared to be a silencer-style accessory in his desk drawer.
Mr. Teixeira's lawyers said his love of the military, and its hardware, impelled him to join the Air Force.
Prosecutors also made public a series of social media posts from 2022 and 2023 in which Airman Teixeira expressed his desire to kill a "ton of people" and cull the "weak minded," and described what he called an "assassination van" that would cruise around killing people in a "crowded urban or suburban environment."
How Airman Teixeira obtained the documents that he is accused of posting online has been a critical question for investigators. They believe he used administrator privileges connected to his role as an information technology specialist to retrieve the documents. In his posts, Airman Teixeira said his job gave him access to material that others could not see. "The job I have lets me get privilege's above most intel guys," he wrote.
Airman Teixeira had been scheduled for a detention hearing in federal court in Boston earlier this month. But his lawyer, Brendan Kelley, requested more time to address the government's arguments, and the magistrate judge, David H. Hennessy, quickly agreed.
The next major step is likely to be the filing of a grand jury indictment, which would include a much more detailed narrative of the allegations against Airman Teixeira, including a more specific accounting of the charges he will face.
Worcester, a city 50 miles west of Boston, is where Judge Hennessy's courtroom is based. But the case will eventually be assigned to a federal judge in Boston, assuming it is not moved out of Massachusetts entirely, which remains a possibility, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Officials at the Justice Department have considered asking that the case be moved to the Eastern District of Virginia, because its jurisdiction includes the Pentagon, and its lawyers have extensive experience in investigating such cases.
But it is not clear that the federal judges in Massachusetts, where Airman Teixeira lived and worked, will be willing to do so, and the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Rachael S. Rollins, a Biden appointee, believes her office is capable of handling the matter, people familiar with the situation said.

WASHINGTON — Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of leaking classified documents, tried to obstruct federal investigators and has a “troubling” history of racist and violent remarks, according to a Justice Department filing that offered the clearest picture to date of his motives.
In an 18-page filing released before a hearing Thursday in a Massachusetts federal court, the department’s lawyers argued that Teixeira needed to be detained indefinitely because he posed a “serious flight risk” and might still have information that would be of “tremendous value to hostile nation states.”
He tapped into vast reservoirs of sensitive information, an amount that “far exceeds what has been publicly disclosed” so far, they added.
On Thursday, a judge ruled that Teixeira would remain in custody while he considered evidence that raised serious questions about the military’s decision to grant him a high-level security clearance — and a request by Teixeira’s court-appointed lawyers that he be released immediately to the custody of his parents on $20,000 bond.
The new details presented by prosecutors, including photos and previously undisclosed direct messages, went beyond procedural issues to the unanswered questions at the heart of the case: Why would a young man jeopardize his future to share intelligence with online friends? And why did the military grant him wide access to its secrets?
The government’s filing offered some clues about his state of mind.
Prosecutors disclosed that he was suspended from high school in 2018 after making alarming comments about the use of Molotov cocktails and other weapons, and trawled the internet for information about mass shootings. He engaged in “regular discussions about violence and murder” on the same social media platform, Discord, that he used to post classified information, the filing said, and he surrounded his bed at his parents’ house with firearms and tactical gear.
Teixeira was also prone to making “racial threats,” prosecutors said.
This behavior — so disturbing it was flagged by local police when he applied for a firearms identification card — raised new questions about how Teixeira obtained a top-secret security clearance. And on Wednesday, the Air Force confirmed it had suspended two of the airman’s superiors, pending an investigation into their supervision of him.
Teixeira’s lawyers dismissed the government’s claim that their client represented a threat to the country, or his community.
His reference to bomb making in high school, which rattled some of his classmates, took place during his sophomore year and was never repeated, they said. In the 90-minute hearing at the federal courthouse in Worcester, Massachusetts, his lawyers also played down the idea that he would have an opportunity to turn information over to the United States’ enemies.
The government provided “little more than speculation that a foreign adversary will seduce Teixeira and orchestrate his clandestine escape from the United States,” his lawyers wrote in response to the department’s memo.
His legal team also offered a fleeting first glimpse at possible defense arguments, claiming that the government has not offered proof Teixeira ever intended for the information posted to a private social media server “to be widely disseminated.”
That did not go over well with the magistrate in the case, David Hennessy, who said he found it “a little incredible the defendant did not foresee that possibility.”
In arguing for his confinement, prosecutors described a panicked effort by Teixeira to cover up his actions as law enforcement closed in, including telling a member of a chat group to “delete all messages,” and instructing a user to stonewall investigators.
He also tried to destroy evidence, prosecutors said. Their filing included a series of photos of electronic equipment, including a tablet and an Xbox console, that he hurriedly smashed then tossed in a dumpster near his home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, before his arrest this month. A witness told the government that he threw his phone out the window of his truck as he was driving.
“These efforts appeared calculated to delay or prevent the government from gaining a full understanding of the seriousness and scale of his conduct,” the department wrote. “Any promise by the defendant to stay home or to refrain from compounding the harm that he has already caused is worth no more than his broken promises to protect classified national defense information.”
Teixeira was arrested April 13 and charged with two separate counts related to the unauthorized handling of classified materials. The government has yet to seek an indictment before a grand jury, although prosecutors said in their filing that he could face 25 years — “and potentially far more” — in prison if convicted.
In a preliminary complaint unsealed after he was taken into custody, Teixeira was accused of abusing his top secret clearance with an intelligence unit on Cape Cod to post documents bearing restrictive classification markings to a 50-member chat group on Discord.
Shortly before signing off in March, Teixeira told a member of the small group he “was very happy” to share intelligence very few people get to see and solicited requests for information they wanted him to post, prosecutors said in their filing before the hearing.
The material, some obtained through keyword searches of government files, was eventually distributed more widely. The trove of documents made public revealed the access Western intelligence agencies have to internal Kremlin deliberations, while baring concerns of the strained U.S.-led alliance trying to contain Russian aggression without prompting a wider conflict.
Last week, The New York Times reported that Teixeira, who worked as a computer network specialist, had been sharing sensitive information far earlier than previously known and to a much larger group. According to online posts reviewed by the Times, he had begun doing so in February 2022, within 48 hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to a chat group of about 600 members.
The filing provided little insight into what prompted Teixeira to leak internal U.S. intelligence assessments, but it cast his actions, which had previously been seen as mainly motivated by his desire to show off to younger friends online, in a somewhat darker light.
Investigators found a small arsenal in his bedroom at the house he shared with his mother and stepfather. Inside a gun locker two feet from his bed, law enforcement officials found multiple weapons, including handguns, bolt-action rifles, shotguns, an AK-style high-capacity weapon and a gas mask. FBI special agents also found ammunition, tactical pouches and what appeared to be a silencer-style accessory in his desk drawer.
Teixeira’s lawyers said his love of the military, and its hardware, impelled him to join the Air Force.
Prosecutors also made public a series of social media posts from 2022 and 2023 in which Teixeira expressed his desire to kill a “ton of people” and cull the “weak minded,” and described what he called an “assassination van” that would cruise around killing people in a “crowded urban or suburban environment.”
How Teixeira obtained the documents that he is accused of posting online has been a critical question for investigators. They believe he used administrator privileges connected to his role as an information technology specialist to retrieve the documents. In his posts, Teixeira said his job gave him access to material that others could not see. “The job I have lets me get privilege’s above most intel guys,” he wrote.
The next major step is likely to be the filing of a grand jury indictment, which would include a much more detailed narrative of the allegations against Teixeira, including a more specific accounting of the charges he will face.
Worcester, a city 50 miles west of Boston, is where Hennessy’s courtroom is based. But the case will eventually be assigned to a federal judge in Boston, assuming it is not moved out of Massachusetts, which remains a possibility, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

Not Just a D.J., Chief of Goldman Sachs Also Dabbles in Luxury Real Estate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: David Solomon is an adviser to and part owner of a private real estate company that Goldman Sachs has sought to do business with.
On Feb. 28, top executives at Goldman Sachs staged an "investor day" to reassure shareholders that the bank would rebound after a disappointing 2022. Barely an hour after the event ended, Goldman's chief executive, David Solomon, boarded one of the company's Gulfstream jets en route to the Bahamas.
His destination was the exclusive Baker's Bay resort, which features a world-famous golf course and a deepwater port large enough to accommodate residents' superyachts. More than a decade earlier, Mr. Solomon had purchased a multimillion-dollar beachfront home from the Discovery Land Company, which built and managed Baker's Bay.
Mr. Solomon is not just a Discovery customer. He's also a part owner of the private company and for years has informally advised its founder -- even as Goldman Sachs vied for work with Discovery.
Many corporate chief executives, of course, sit on other companies' boards of directors, but such external commitments are much less common in the heavily regulated banking industry. Regulatory filings by most of Mr. Solomon's counterparts on Wall Street do not reveal similar outside business activities.
Mr. Solomon's relationship with Discovery raises questions about the potential for conflicts of interest and distractions from his day job running an elite Wall Street bank.
Tracy Yue Wang, the chairman of the finance department at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, said a conflict could arise if Mr. Solomon ever had to choose between advancing Goldman's business and nurturing his personal investment in Discovery.
"It's definitely not good corporate governance practice," she said.
Stephen Lubben, an expert in corporate governance and business ethics at Seton Hall Law School, said Goldman's regulators and shareholders might worry about Mr. Solomon becoming distracted. "Running a major financial institution is very much a full-time job," he said.
Over the past two years, Mr. Solomon has used Goldman's corporate jet more than 20 times to fly to Discovery properties, including those where he doesn't own homes, according to flight records reviewed by The New York Times and people familiar with Mr. Solomon's travels.
In a regulatory filing, Mr. Solomon said he spends "less than eight hours per year" as a "passive board observer" for Discovery.
Tony Fratto, a Goldman spokesman, said Mr. Solomon's investment in Discovery was in the "single-digit millions." He said Mr. Solomon has no fiduciary responsibilities toward Discovery and "is not involved in the business operations" of the company.
Mr. Fratto said there was "no conflict whatsoever" between Mr. Solomon's job at Goldman and his relationship with and investment in Discovery. "It's absurd to think he'd guide his decision-making here for such a small personal investment," he said. Mr. Fratto said Mr. Solomon reimburses Goldman when he uses its jet for personal reasons.
Jill Basinger, Discovery's chief legal officer, said that Mr. Solomon was only a small investor in the company and that it had never done business with Goldman.
This is not the first time questions have surfaced about how Mr. Solomon's outside interests affect his work at Goldman, for which he has received more than $ 150 million in compensation since he became chief executive in 2018.
Some bank employees have privately grumbled that his hobby performing as an electronic dance music D.J. is a distraction, especially with Goldman in the financial doldrums and laying off thousands of employees. On occasion, Goldman employees have helped manage Mr. Solomon's D.J. performance schedule, The Times previously reported.
Mr. Fratto said the D.J. work was separate from Mr. Solomon's day job. "I think The New York Times is trying to make this a pattern," Mr. Fratto said.
Mr. Solomon has long been friends with Michael Meldman, the ultrawealthy co-founder (along with the actor George Clooney and Rande Gerber, a former model) of the tequila brand Casamigos.
Discovery, which Mr. Meldman founded in 1994, builds small complexes of mansions, generally alongside a golf course and outdoor recreation area. They serve as something akin to summer camp for the rich and famous. They are staffed with sports trainers to help members learn activities like kite boarding. Members can golf barefoot or in bathing suits and visit "comfort stations" -- miniature candy stores or replicas of New York delis -- between holes.
Mr. Solomon bought a Baker's Bay mansion in 2011. Over the years, he and Mr. Meldman became close. Mr. Solomon has been a D.J. at Mr. Meldman's birthday party, at Baker's Bay New Year's Eve celebrations and at the opening of Discovery's private beach club, Dune Deck, in the Hamptons.
The more time they spent together, the more ideas Mr. Solomon expressed about how Mr. Meldman should run the business, according to three people familiar with their relationship. "He advises Mike when Mike asks him questions," Mr. Fratto said. "Is that unusual? Not at all."
Mr. Meldman in 2018 invited Mr. Solomon to an event at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York with Danilo Medina, then the president of the Dominican Republic. One of the goals of the dinner was to persuade Mr. Medina to build a new airport on the island that would be used exclusively by Discovery and its members, according to two people familiar with the dinner.
Mr. Fratto said Mr. Solomon attended the dinner but did not push for the airport, which was never built. (A representative of Mr. Medina did not respond to a request for comment.)
In 2017, Bryan Slotkin, a managing director at Goldman who regarded Mr. Solomon as a mentor, left the bank to join Discovery. Once there, he introduced a team of real estate lenders in Goldman's asset management division to Discovery employees who were managing a resort and housing development in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, according to people familiar with the discussions.
While the resort, called Chileno Bay, was run by Discovery, it was owned by a group of outside developers. Those developers had previously taken out a $ 40 million loan from another lender.
Following Mr. Slotkin's introduction, Goldman bought and then expanded the loan. A Discovery employee and a representative of the owners soon negotiated with Goldman bankers to refinance it.
The Discovery employee reported to colleagues, including Mr. Meldman, that Goldman had "accepted some meaningful terms the Borrower requested," according to an email reviewed by The Times. Describing the progress as "very exciting," the employee said Goldman was offering relatively low fees. Refinancing with Goldman instead of finding a new lender would be cheaper, according to "every broker or lender we have spoken with in the marketplace," the employee wrote. The deal went through in 2020.
Mr. Solomon was not involved in the refinancing, Mr. Fratto said. The Goldman employees in charge of the division that made the loan knew of Mr. Solomon's friendship with Mr. Meldman, according to a former Goldman executive.
Another team of Goldman bankers, meanwhile, met with Discovery executives to pitch them on other services. Discovery was hoping to raise money by selling shares of itself to a select group of outside investors. It marked an important milestone for the private company, which until then had not offered equity to outsiders.
To prepare for the pitch, Goldman's team pored over Discovery's finances to determine how much the company was worth. They estimated that its value was substantially below $ 1 billion.
That was less than Mr. Meldman had hoped. Mr. Solomon personally delivered the disappointing news to his friend, according to two people familiar with the discussion. Goldman did not win the assignment.
Mr. Fratto said the lower-than-expected valuation showed that Goldman was not giving special treatment to a company with ties to Mr. Solomon.
In early 2021, Discovery completed the private fund-raising, without the help of a bank. The company sold $ 300 million of shares to investors including Mr. Solomon. Now he was more than a Discovery adviser -- he was also a part-owner.
Mr. Fratto said Mr. Solomon's investment was approved by Goldman's compliance department. He said Mr. Solomon would have to recuse himself from any future decisions involving Discovery.
Shortly after the fund-raising, Discovery created an advisory board. Mr. Solomon was granted "observer" status, meaning he could attend meetings.
Last September, the group gathered in Beverly Hills, where Discovery has offices. Mr. Fratto said that was the only meeting Mr. Solomon attended.
Flight records show that, since his investment in Discovery, a Gulfstream jet that is almost exclusively used by Mr. Solomon has flown roughly once a quarter to locations like the Hamptons, the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Ga., and Baker's Bay. Mr. Meldman's Gulfstream was at those locations at the same time.
In January, Mr. Solomon spent a weekend at Discovery's resort in Cabo San Lucas. That Monday, he flew to Los Angeles and watched the college football championship game from a private box alongside several Discovery executives and investors, including Mr. Meldman. Kelley James, a musician who often performs at Discovery properties, posted a photo of the group on Instagram.
Mr. Fratto said the trip and the game had nothing to do with Discovery.
"This guy spends all his time on Goldman Sachs work," he said. "He's obsessed with Goldman Sachs."

Tech Pioneer Sees Way for U.S. to Lead on Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It has been six decades since Ivan Sutherland created Sketchpad, a software system that foretold the future of interactive and graphical computing. In the 1970s, he played a role in rallying the computer industry to build a new type of microchip with hundreds of thousands of circuits that would become the foundation of today's semiconductor industry.
Now Dr. Sutherland, who is 84, believes the United States is failing at a crucial time to consider alternative chip-making technologies that would allow the country to reclaim the lead in building the most advanced computers.
By relying on supercooled electronic circuits that switch without electrical resistance and as a consequence generate no excess heat at higher speeds, computer designers will be able to circumvent the greatest technological barrier to faster machines, he claims.
"The nation that best seizes the superconducting digital circuit opportunity will enjoy computing superiority for decades to come," he and a colleague recently wrote in an essay that circulated among technologists and government officials.
Dr. Sutherland's insights are significant partly because decades ago he was instrumental in helping to create today's dominant approach to making computer chips.
In the 1970s, Dr. Sutherland, who was chairman of the computer science department at the California Institute of Technology, and his brother Bert Sutherland, then a research manager at a division of Xerox called the Palo Alto Research Center, introduced the computer scientist Lynn Conway to the physicist Carver Mead.
They pioneered a design based on a type of transistor, known as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, which was invented in the United States. It made it possible to manufacture the microchips used by personal computers, video games and the vast array of business, consumer and military products.
Now Dr. Sutherland is arguing that an alternative technology that predates CMOS, and has had many false starts, should be given another look. Superconducting electronics was pioneered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s and then pursued by IBM in the 1970s before being largely abandoned. At one point, it even made an odd international detour before returning to the United States.
In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, read an article in the Russian newspaper Pravda describing an astounding advance in low-temperature computing made by Fujitsu, the Japanese microelectronics giant.
Mr. Gorbachev was intrigued. Wasn't this an area, he wanted to know, where the Soviet Union could excel? The task of giving a five-minute briefing to the Soviet Politburo eventually fell to Konstantin Likharev, a young associate professor of physics at Moscow State University.
When he read the article, however, Dr. Likharev realized that the Pravda reporter had misread the news release and claimed the Fujitsu superconducting memory chip was five orders of magnitude faster than it was.
Dr. Likharev explained the error, but he noted that the field still held promise.
That set off a chain of events through which Dr. Likharev's tiny lab was granted several million dollars in research support, making it possible for him to build a small team of researchers and, eventually, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, relocate to the United States. Dr. Likharev took a physics position at Stony Brook University in New York and helped start Hypres, a digital superconductor company that still exists.
The story might have ended there. But it appears that the elusive technology may be gaining momentum once more because the costs of modern chip making have become immense. A new semiconductor factory costs $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion and takes up to five years to complete.
Dr. Sutherland argues that rather than pushing on more expensive technology that is yielding diminishing efficiencies, the United States should consider training a generation of young engineers capable of thinking outside the box.
Superconductor-based computing systems, where electrical resistance in the switches and wires falls to zero, might solve the cooling challenge that increasingly bedevils the world's data centers.
CMOS chip making is dominated by Taiwanese and South Korean companies. The United States is now planning to spend almost one-third of a trillion dollars of private and public money in an effort to rebuild the nation's chip industry and regain its global dominance.
Dr. Sutherland is joined by others in the industry who believe that CMOS manufacturing is hitting fundamental limits that will make the cost of progress intolerable.
"I think we can say with some assurance that we're going to have to radically change the way we design computers because we really are approaching the limits of what is possible with our current technology based on silicon," said Jonathan Koomey, a specialist in large-scale computing energy requirements.
As it has shrunk the size of transistors to the size of just hundreds or thousands of atoms, the semiconductor industry has been increasingly bedeviled with a variety of technical challenges.
Modern microprocessor chips also suffer from what engineers describe as "dark silicon." If all the billions of transistors on a modern microprocessor chip are used simultaneously, the heat they create will melt the chip. Consequently, entire sections of modern chips are shut down and only some of the transistors are working at any time -- making them far less efficient.
Dr. Sutherland said the United States should consider alternative technologies for national security reasons. The advantages of a superconducting computing technology might first be useful in the highly competitive market for cellular base stations, the specialized computers inside cellphone towers that process wireless signals, he suggested. China has become a dominant force in the market for the current 5G technology, but next-generation 6G chips would benefit from both the extreme speed and significantly lower power requirement of superconducting processors, he said.
Other industry executives agree. "Ivan is right that the power problem is the big issue," said John L. Hennessy, an electrical engineer who is the chairman of Alphabet and a former president of Stanford. He said there were only two ways to solve the problem -- either by gaining efficiency with new design, which is unlikely for general purpose computers, or by creating a new technology that is not bound by existing rules.
One such opportunity might be to fashion new computer designs that mimic the human brain, which is a marvel of low-power computing efficiency. Artificial intelligence research in a field known as neuromorphic computing has previously used conventional silicon manufacturing.
"There is really the potential of creating the equivalent of the human brain using superconducting technology," said Elie Track, chief technology officer of Hypres, the superconducting company. Compared with quantum computing technology, which is still in early experimental stages, "this is something that can be done now, but regrettably the funding agencies haven't paid attention to it," he said.
The time for superconducting computing may not yet have arrived, partly because every time that the CMOS world seems about to hit a final obstacle, clever engineering has surmounted it.
In 2019, a team of researchers at M.I.T. led by Max Shulaker announced that it had built a microprocessor from carbon nanotubes that promised 10 times the energy efficiency of today's silicon chips. Dr. Shulaker is working with Analog Devices, a semiconductor maker in Wilmington, Mass., to commercialize a hybrid version of the technology.
"More and more, I believe you cannot beat silicon," he said. "It's a moving target, and it's really good at what it does."
But as silicon is nearing atomic limits, alternative approaches once again appear promising. Mark Horowitz, a Stanford computer scientist who has helped start several Silicon Valley companies, said he was unwilling to discount Dr. Sutherland's passion for superconducting electronics.
"People who've changed the course of history are always slightly crazy, you know, but sometimes they're crazy right," he said.

It made it possible to manufacture the microchips used by personal computers, video games and the vast array of business, consumer and military products.
Now Sutherland is arguing that an alternative technology that predates CMOS, and has had many false starts, should be given another look. Superconducting electronics was pioneered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s and then pursued by IBM in the 1970s before being largely abandoned. At one point, it even made an odd international detour before returning to the United States.
In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, read an article in the Russian newspaper Pravda describing an astounding advance in low-temperature computing made by Fujitsu, the Japanese microelectronics giant.
Gorbachev was intrigued. Wasn’t this an area, he wanted to know, where the Soviet Union could excel? The task of giving a five-minute briefing to the Soviet Politburo eventually fell to Konstantin Likharev, a young associate professor of physics at Moscow State University.
When he read the article, however, Likharev realized that the Pravda reporter had misread the news release and claimed the Fujitsu superconducting memory chip was five orders of magnitude faster than it was.
Likharev explained the error, but he noted that the field still held promise.
That set off a chain of events through which Likharev’s tiny lab was granted several million dollars in research support, making it possible for him to build a small team of researchers and, eventually, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, relocate to the United States. Likharev took a physics position at Stony Brook University in New York and helped start Hypres, a digital superconductor company that still exists.
The story might have ended there. But it appears that the elusive technology may be gaining momentum once more because the costs of modern chipmaking have become immense. A new semiconductor factory costs $10 billion to $20 billion and takes up to five years to complete.
Sutherland argues that rather than pushing on more expensive technology that is yielding diminishing efficiencies, the United States should consider training a generation of young engineers capable of thinking outside the box.
Superconductor-based computing systems, where electrical resistance in the switches and wires falls to zero, might solve the cooling challenge that increasingly bedevils the world’s data centers.
CMOS chipmaking is dominated by Taiwanese and South Korean companies. The United States is now planning to spend almost one-third of a trillion dollars of private and public money in an effort to rebuild the nation’s chip industry and regain its global dominance.
Sutherland is joined by others in the industry who believe that CMOS manufacturing is hitting fundamental limits that will make the cost of progress intolerable.
“I think we can say with some assurance that we’re going to have to radically change the way we design computers because we really are approaching the limits of what is possible with our current technology based on silicon,” said Jonathan Koomey, a specialist in large-scale computing energy requirements.
As it has shrunk the size of transistors to the size of just hundreds or thousands of atoms, the semiconductor industry has been increasingly bedeviled with a variety of technical challenges.
Modern microprocessor chips also suffer from what engineers describe as “dark silicon.” If all the billions of transistors on a modern microprocessor chip are used simultaneously, the heat they create will melt the chip. Consequently, entire sections of modern chips are shut down and only some of the transistors are working at any time — making them far less efficient.
Sutherland said the United States should consider alternative technologies for national security reasons. The advantages of a superconducting computing technology might first be useful in the highly competitive market for cellular base stations, the specialized computers inside cellphone towers that process wireless signals, he suggested. China has become a dominant force in the market for the current 5G technology, but next-generation 6G chips would benefit from both the extreme speed and significantly lower power requirement of superconducting processors, he said.
Other industry executives agree. “Ivan is right that the power problem is the big issue,” said John L. Hennessy, an electrical engineer who is chairman of Alphabet and a former president of Stanford University. He said there were only two ways to solve the problem — either by gaining efficiency with new design, which is unlikely for general purpose computers, or by creating a new technology that is not bound by existing rules.
One such opportunity might be to fashion new computer designs that mimic the human brain, which is a marvel of low-power computing efficiency. Artificial intelligence research in a field known as neuromorphic computing has previously used conventional silicon manufacturing.
“There is really the potential of creating the equivalent of the human brain using superconducting technology,” said Elie Track, chief technology officer of Hypres, a superconducting company. Compared with quantum computing technology, which is still in early experimental stages, “this is something that can be done now, but regrettably the funding agencies haven’t paid attention to it,” he said.
The time for superconducting computing may not yet have arrived, partly because every time that the CMOS world seems about to hit a final obstacle, clever engineering has surmounted it.
In 2019, a team of researchers at MIT led by Max Shulaker announced that it had built a microprocessor from carbon nanotubes that promised 10 times the energy efficiency of today’s silicon chips. Shulaker is working with Analog Devices, a semiconductor maker in Wilmington, Massachusetts, to commercialize a hybrid version of the technology.
“More and more, I believe you cannot beat silicon,” he said. “It’s a moving target, and it’s really good at what it does.”
But as silicon is nearing atomic limits, alternative approaches once again appear promising. Mark Horowitz, a Stanford computer scientist who has helped start several Silicon Valley companies, said he was unwilling to discount Sutherland’s passion for superconducting electronics.
“People who’ve changed the course of history are always slightly crazy, you know, but sometimes they’re crazy right,” he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For nearly four years, the Tiffany & Company flagship store on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 57th Street was shrouded in scaffolding while it underwent a full-bore renovation. In the days before the reopening, set for April 28, a Tiffany executive vice president, Alexandre Arnault, and the company's chief executive, Anthony Ledru, monitored final preparations as they whispered to each other in French.
Display cases glittered with Tiffany pieces -- heart tag bracelets, Elsa Peretti Bone cuffs and Paloma Picasso necklaces. Digital screens encircling the room showed an animation of a diamond-encrusted bird fluttering across the New York City skyline.
"We asked ourselves lots of questions going into this," Mr. Ledru, 50, said. "Are we going to change the feel? Do we respect tradition? We decided to do both."
He gestured toward the digitized bird, noting that it was based on a design by the noted Tiffany jewelry artist Jean Schlumberger.
"There's that tension: modernity and heritage," he said.
A lot has changed at Tiffany since the makeover began. Namely, the company's ownership. In 2021, after fraught negotiations, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired Tiffany for about $ 16 billion. The sale was one of the largest deals ever in the luxury world, as well as LVMH's most significant American brand acquisition to date.
In effect, the jewelry emporium became the property of Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old founder, chairman and largest shareholder of LVMH, who recently dethroned Elon Musk as the world's richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Over three decades, he has built a kingdom of more than 75 brands, including Dior, Celine, TAG Heuer, Bulgari, Fendi, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.
As construction workers toiled away on the ground floor last week, one of Mr. Arnault's five children, Alexandre Arnault, 30, stood near the spot where "Equals Pi," a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, would go. The painting, which features a shade of blue similar to Tiffany's signature color, appeared prominently in Tiffany's 2021 "About Love" ad campaign starring Jay-Z and Beyoncé.
"When people enter from Fifth Avenue, they will see the Basquiat," said Alexandre Arnault, who wore a Dior suit and Loro Piana sneakers. "It's an important part of the Tiffany brand now."
Tall and lanky, Mr. Arnault, who is responsible for much of Tiffany's creative vision, was one of the architects of the "About Love" campaign. The use of the Basquiat spurred a bit of controversy when a former Basquiat assistant insisted that the artist hadn't intended any homage to the brand.
But that didn't matter much from a marketing perspective: The Tiffany name was in the news for days, signaling that it no longer belonged solely to the era when Holly Golightly (portrayed by Audrey Hepburn) admired the vitrines of its flagship in the 1961 film "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The new Tiffany, the LVMH Tiffany, was showing itself as a brand that could also be disruptive and viral.
Amid speculation about which of the Arnault children will succeed the LVMH founder, Alexandre Arnault was tasked with the job of overseeing the renovation of the Tiffany store, which the company calls the Landmark. Before moving from Paris to New York two years ago to immerse himself in the project, he reinvigorated the luggage company Rimowa, another LVMH brand, through collaborations with Virgil Abloh and Supreme.
Mr. Ledru, the Tiffany chief executive, who was born in the Brittany area of France and raised in Lille, is a luxury industry veteran who has worked for Louis Vuitton, Harry Winston and Cartier. When a droplet of blood appeared on his chin that afternoon, the result of a shaving cut, a publicist hurried to fetch him a napkin.
"This is not just another flagship," Mr. Ledru said. "For us, the Landmark is now the lighthouse of the brand."
The reboot left the building's facade untouched, and the Atlas statue clock still sits above its entrance, but it spared little else. The Landmark unabashedly represents LVMH's desire to imprint its DNA onto the company founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young.
The Tiffany flagship opened on Fifth Avenue in 1940. When the gut renovation began in 2019, the store moved into the former Niketown site next door. The Landmark was designed by the architect Peter Marino, and its 10 floors are replete with works by artists like Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Richard Prince and Rashid Johnson. Flashy accouterments include a Daniel Boulud restaurant, the Blue Box Cafe, which serves a "Breakfast at Tiffany" meal, and an Audrey Hepburn experience room that features a replica of her black Givenchy dress from the movie's opening scene. (LVMH acquired Givenchy in 1988.)
"People relate a lot to her when it comes to Tiffany," Mr. Arnault said. "So we wanted to make a homage to her."
While giving a tour of the building to a reporter, the two executives walked up an undulating mirror-lined staircase inspired by Ms. Peretti's designs. The third floor specialized in wedding and engagement rings, the fourth in gold and diamonds, the fifth in silver and the sixth in home goods and accessories. The seventh floor included a Patek Philippe department and a jewelry workshop.
Mr. Ledru described the nuances that went into designing each floor, while Mr. Arnault strayed from the press tour, inspecting side rooms and taking photos with his phone.
Earlier, the two executives had sat for a more formal interview on a green couch in a book-lined room. Conservative and tight-lipped in its approach to public relations, LVMH would not disclose the Landmark's construction cost. A publicist, who sat in on the interview, said beforehand that inquiries about the LVMH succession were off-limits. Nonetheless, Mr. Arnault and Mr. Ledru fielded a few hot-seat questions.
At age 30, was Mr. Arnault feeling any heat to deliver on his mission for the family?
"Am I sweating?" he said. "No. Because I'm surrounded by the best professionals we could have."
On the eve of the Landmark's opening, were they concerned about talk that a recession may be on its way?
"There's ups and downs, but the one thing about the U.S. is that it comes back strong," Mr. Ledru said. "New York is much stronger now than it was last year and the year before. I don't want to be overly confident, but we're happy to finally open our doors.
Mr. Arnault added: "We're releasing our Q1 numbers for LVMH tomorrow. I encourage you to have a look."
(The day after the interview, LVMH reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter sales, surpassing analyst expectations. In response, French workers protesting against pension changes stormed LVMH's Paris headquarters, calling for the rich to contribute more financing to the state pension.)
If they weren't nervous about the economy, were they worried about anything else?
"I'm anxious for the first holiday season," Mr. Arnault said. "It's such an important part of American culture. This is the first one back at the original Tiffany's corner."
"We were a lot more anxious a year ago, when we were receiving phone calls from Mr. Arnault asking, 'When do you open?"' Mr. Ledru said.
After the two men finished their tour of the Landmark, they stepped onto the building's eighth floor deck. They stood in the fresh spring breeze as they took in the view of Fifth Avenue.
"Pas mal, non?" Mr. Ledru said. ("Not bad, no?")
While construction workers hammered away behind them, hurrying to add the final touches on a glass-walled event space, Mr. Arnault took note of several other LVMH properties within his sight: There was Louis Vuitton just across the street, Bulgari opposite it and Dior down the way.
He smiled.
"I can spy on them," Mr. Arnault said. "I can make sure they're working from here."

When Celebrities Sling Mud, It's Fertile Soil for Drama: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A dramatization of the trial between the wives of two soccer stars is returning to the West End in London, joining TV shows, podcasts and documentaries about the high-profile spat.
With its stage transformed into a green soccer pitch, "Vardy v. Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial" at Wyndham's Theater in London last November promised its nearly sold-out audience a game, and the two women onstage were both trying to score a goal.
But as two pundits ooh'ed and aah'ed from the sidelines, the actresses sparring were not playing soccer stars but the women married to them, caught at the center of an Instagram feud turned high-profile libel case that captured the British public's attention last May and peeled back the curtain hiding the machinations of British celebrity and the glitzy world of English soccer.
"I see it as a comedy of manners," said Liv Hennessy, the writer of the play, which returns to the West End on Thursday at the Ambassadors Theater. "It's a theatrical way for us to look at the way people behave in our current society."
The play is just one recent retelling of the real-life case that became known as the "Wagatha Christie" trial, in which Rebekah Vardy, the wife of the Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, sued Coleen Rooney, the wife of the former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, for defamation. The catalyst: Rooney's accusation, on Twitter, that Vardy had leaked her personal information to the British press.
The wives and girlfriends of soccer players -- commonly known in Britain by the acronym WAGs -- have long been followed by tabloids, but Rooney's post caused an online furor. Its escalation into the legal realm led to breathless coverage, drawing in powerhouse lawyers and unearthing revelations about both women's personal lives.
The legal side of the long-running saga came to an end last July, with the High Court ruling against Vardy, saying that the reputational damage from the scandal was not libel and ordering Vardy to pay almost all of Rooney's legal costs, which amounted to about £1.7 million, or $ 1.9 million.
But the case's power as a story has lived on, with production companies, documentary makers, podcasters and journalists finding the unfolding trial and its cast of characters just too irresistible not to dissect, all helped by the availability of the weeklong case's court transcripts.
"It's the old adage of: You can't write this," said Thomas Popay, the creative director of Chalkboard TV, which produced a two-part dramatization, "Vardy v. Rooney: A Courtroom Drama," that aired on Channel 4 in Britain last December. "We literally didn't. We took the transcripts and recreated them."
Alongside the West End play and Channel 4 show, offerings for followers of the feud include a BBC podcast called "It's ... Wagatha Christie" and the Discovery+ documentary "Vardy vs Rooney: The Wagatha Trial." Rooney has signed a Disney+ deal for a three-part documentary looking at the events leading up to the trial, and the saga is reportedly being considered for a retelling as part of the series "A Very British Scandal."
"All of us can relate to the idea of being betrayed -- especially betrayed by someone who we trusted," Popay said. "And on Vardy's side -- we can all relate to not being believed."
In her 2019 social media post, Rooney described how she concocted a sting operation to reveal the betrayer by posting false stories that were visible to a single account -- Vardy's -- to test if they would turn up in The Sun, a London tabloid.
The popularity of the post led to Rooney being nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" -- a portmanteau of WAG and Agatha Christie, the mystery writer -- for her detective work. Vardy quickly denied she was the leaker and sued Rooney for defaming her.
"We are absolutely interested in people's misfortunes and what goes on in celebrity lives," said Adrian Bingham, a professor of modern British history at the University of Sheffield who has studied media and gender issues. The women's involvement with the soccer world gave their dispute resonance with a wider audience, he added, while the legal case gave the non-tabloid media a legitimate reason to cover it. Producers of the adaptations say they have asked their own lawyers to look over scripts, lest they find themselves accused of defamation.
The court transcript itself had moments and revelations that many say were ripe for re-enactment: a phone with key evidence in the form of WhatsApp messages, apparently lost to the bottom of the North Sea; lawyers in wigs formally reading out text messages from the women, some containing profanities; Vardy's tears on the witness stand after cross-examination by David Sherborne, Rooney's lawyer.
"It was positively Shakespearean in terms of how it went down," said Popay. "We decided the best thing to do and the most accurate thing to do was to completely recreate the trial by using the court transcripts verbatim." His company's show, which was commissioned in May during the trial and aired in December, drew 1.5 million viewers.
Hennessy, the writer of the West End play, also relied heavily on the court transcripts, but took liberties by leaning into the soccer world, structuring the play like a game itself. Reading the transcripts, she said she was struck by the humanity of the two women, who have both been criticized (Vardy has said that people made abusive threats toward her and her unborn baby following that fateful post, while the trial laid bare tensions in Rooney's marriage and her experience growing up with fame).
"It does ask how complicit we are in creating public figures, and tearing them down when they don't meet our standards," Hennessy said.
Even at a rehearsal in late March, before the play's official return, it was clear the trial continued to intrigue and perplex even the cast members. During a pivotal scene in which Rooney is grilled by Vardy's lawyer on precisely why she made the fateful decision to share the feud with the world, the actors broke character to pose their own burning questions: Was that decision one of a calculating woman, or a woman at a breaking point? Why had she not privately confronted Vardy? And what did it feel like to live, as they imagined Rooney did, in a world where one's image could become a public commodity?
Though celebrity gossip can be easy to dismiss as frivolous, the two opponents in the trial were both women from working-class backgrounds who laid out one aspirational pathway for others like them, said Rebecca Twomey, an entertainment correspondent who has covered both women closely.
"We like to put people on pedestals -- and bring them down," she said, adding that many people enjoyed a modern-day pantomime. "You might think they're airhead WAGs, but these are two sharp, intelligent women."
Still, the enduring appeal of the high drama of "Wagatha Christie" is also simple, Professor Bingham said.
"The reason people are telling it is not because it's insightful," he added. "It's because it's a great story -- with great lines."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One sunny Saturday in the middle of the island of Barbados, in the eastern Caribbean, among former sugar cane plantations, I found myself eating fried sea cat in the yard of a rum shop called De Thirsty Lizard in the village of Bridgefield.
Remixed versions of Rihanna songs and reggae bounced across the gravel courtyard as locals streamed in wearing stylish, spend-the-whole-Saturday-out outfits, with brightly patterned shirts and dresses, tilted fedoras and mirrored sunglasses. Denise Alleyne, 39, and Racquel Jordan, 45, two locals who had brought me to the Lizard, encouraged me to try the sea cat -- the Barbadian word for octopus -- which was served in a basket like French fries and amazingly tender.
As the yard filled up and some people started dancing, waitresses hauled ice buckets to the wobbly hightops full of young people, who grabbed the ice cubes with tongs and plunked them into glasses half-full of Barbadian Mount Gay rum. "When people come to Barbados and they ask what's the best thing to do, this is the best thing to do," said Ms. Alleyne.
You could say there are two ways to visit Barbados, the easternmost island in the Caribbean. One is by booking a resort on the west coast of the island, hiring a car to drop you off at reception, settling into a chaise longue in the sand and fading away into vacation mode. This method, should you choose it, can be fantastic. The beaches are almost invariably beautiful, with the leaning palms you see in screen savers curving up and out over cerulean waters. Everyone speaks English, the currency is pegged two-to-one to the U.S. dollar, the sunshine is pretty much constant, and the rum punch-fish sandwich-sunset combination would please just about anyone.
So it's no surprise that tourism arrivals on the island have returned to prepandemic levels this winter, with 60,000 visitors arriving in December.
But independent travelers may feel that they miss something visiting Barbados in this way. For one, you're yoked to this part of the island's painful traffic, a crawling stream of cars inching north-south along too tight a road for too many resorts, frustrating even a quick dash to the supermarket and making roadside walking a hairy proposition.
You also end up with a peculiar view of the island: The majority of the people you're likely to see will be white (often British) tourists, being waited on by Black locals. Most of all you miss the experience of sitting at a hightop table in the backyard of a rum shop with friendly Barbadians (who refer to themselves as Bajans), discussing culture, politics and change, and noshing on octopus. You miss exploring Barbados's soul.
"The prepackaged Barbados is part of Barbados too, but it's not the way most local people experience the country," said Kristina Hinds, a professor who heads the department of government, sociology, social work and psychology at the Barbados campus of the University of the West Indies. "Get out of the hotel, take the bus, go to the rum shops, go to the fish market. That's how you get a real feel for Barbados."
Now is a particularly fascinating time to visit Barbados. For one, there's the Rihanna affect: The country's most famous homegrown star, who revealed her second pregnancy while ascending to the heights of Phoenix's State Farm Stadium during the Super Bowl half time show this year, has given Barbados new visibility and cachet.
And on Nov. 30, 2021, at the same event where Rihanna was formally named a national hero of the country, Barbados declared itself a republic. The act removed the British monarch as the head of state of Barbados -- even though it was a ceremonial role.
"It doesn't effect how the country has been governed, but some people think of removing that ceremonial position as the last step in the independence project," Ms. Hinds said.
She added that it was no coincidence that the move finally occurred amid the Black Lives Matter movement and under the watch of the country's first female prime minister, Mia Mottley, who is Black.
And so today, after three centuries of British rule, change is afoot in Barbados, and the fresh energy is palpable, even to tourists like me.
Road trip to the heart
The best way to dive into the heart of Barbados is to get up early on a Saturday and head to the interior.
During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Barbados had a plantation economy driven largely by sugar. During that time white landowners became extraordinarily rich, thanks to the labor of enslaved people brought over from Africa.
Today, driving the roads of the Barbadian countryside, signs of that past are everywhere. The ruins of old sugar mills dot the horizon like the water towers of small-town America, identifying the former ownership of the surrounding area. Much of the countryside is still devoted to sugar cane: six-foot-tall green and yellow stalks planted so tightly along the sides of the road that they whip the car's passenger-side rearview mirror as you drive, like the floppy ribbons of a carwash.
The roads are still scattershot in their organization, because they are largely defined not by topological features like rivers or hills but by old property lines. They intersect and then fork, curve and then abruptly end, making driving perhaps the greatest safety challenge a visitor will face on the island. GPS is a very good friend to have in Barbados.
Setting out just after sunrise on Saturday, you can drive out to the center of the island, about a half-hour from the coasts, where the Brighton Farmer's Market unfolds on a bluff overlooking the green fields of a former plantation, starting at 6:30 a.m. This is the place where locals come to sell their wares. You'll find fresh coffee and breakfast pastries to fuel you as you peruse the dozens of tents selling jewelry, woodwork, textiles and even the omnipresent rum punch.
Nothing is cheap: Barbados is relatively expensive, thanks to a deep dependence on imports and the supply-chain disruptions of the pandemic, so you'll want to bring more cash than you think you might need. The market is a great opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with a local, as most are open and friendly and ready to chat. Within moments of our meeting, Jean Date, who was born in Britain, but moved to Barbados nearly 50 years ago and now sells fabric creations at the market, had told me about everything -- from the island's hot new sports craze, road tennis, to its sustainability issues.
"Because we import so much, the last two years have led us to think more about food security," she said, before adding, as I finally, reluctantly walked away, "You've got to see a road tennis competition!"
I didn't make it far before Christian Paul, a vendor, snagged me and insisted I try his Elixir Rum Punch, which soon drew a handful of nearby vendors and veered into a lively discussion about where I should go for the best karaoke on the island, which they called "mandatory."
"Wendy's Sports Bar is a good one," said a man selling wood carvings, as another shot him down: "Bay Lounge! She should go to Bay Lounge if she wants to have a good time." And that's how a visitor can go from sampling samosas to singing in the back of the Bay Lounge in a pink house with a pool table and balcony view of the ocean in the town of Cambridge.
Any local will tell you, there's one thing you must have for lunch in Barbados on a Saturday, and that's pudding and souse. The "pudding" is a mash of sweet potato, herbs and clove steamed in pig intestines, in the style of Scottish haggis. The souse is the historically undesirable bits of the pig left for enslaved people -- tail, ear, cheeks and trotters -- pickled in lime juice and chopped up with onion and spicy Scotch bonnet peppers. Combined, the two elements become what could be described as a sweet-and-salty pork ceviche that's so spicy it almost begs for cold beer.
Perhaps the best place to try it is at the Village Bar at Lemon Arbour, a beloved local restaurant about a half-hour drive through the countryside from the farmer's market. The restaurant is in a converted home lined in Hennessy advertisements, and with a back porch that looks out onto rolling fields of farmland. The line for food stretches out the door on Saturdays, and the menu is expansive, but most people go for the pudding and souse.
The owner, Ann Leacock, 60, whose children also work at the restaurant, reigns over the scene like a queen floating among her fans as she touches each table, greeting regulars and kissing babies. She clears endless empty green bottles of Deputy beer as she makes conversation with the guests. Today she's discussing Barbadian sovereignty.
"Being a republic is more about us being able to make decisions now on our own -- just as we should be able to," she says, and explains with disdain the ways in which the country is still tied to the Crown.
She's interrupted by an older Black man leaning over the bar and shouting, "You still got souse?"
The wild east
Heading farther east from the Village Bar, you'll reach the island's wild east coast, which is anchored by the town of Bathsheba. Here there aren't any lazy palms over still turquoise waters. This is hardcore surfing country. The rough winds from the Atlantic blast this side of the island, spritzing salt water everywhere along the cliffs overlooking rocky beaches and frothy, dark blue water.
Most of this region is sparsely populated, so driving here can feel like wandering through open country, with stunning vistas around every turn, a bit like the east coast of Oahu.
A good rest stop after the drive is the Hillcrest Community Center, which opened last year to provide a venue for small businesses. The star among them is Zemi, a stylish family-owned restaurant named after an Amerindian deity, with a panoramic deck overlooking the tempestuous ocean. The menu ranges from fried goat cheese and microgreens salads to rum-glazed pork belly platters, served by the owners' daughter Ella.
It's easy to fall under the spell of the east coast and turn your back on all the traffic on the west side. If you do, a good place to stay is Eco Lifestyle + Lodge, a boutique hotel specializing in environmentally conscious offerings. From the 10 rooms guests can enjoy saltwater pools, a pescatarian restaurant, compostable water bottles, free meditation classes and fresh coconut water from the property's palm trees.
Seeking local flavors
On another day, you might head north up the western coastal road. Once you pass Holetown, you'll again enter into a more manageable Barbados, where the traffic is lighter, the resorts are smaller, and more businesses are locally owned. Take Caboose, an old green and blue fishing boat propped up on the side of the road, north of the country's second-largest city, Speightstown. The owner, Wayne Francois, set it up less than a year ago, but already it's in the running for the best fish cutter (sandwich) on the island -- no small claim.
Speightstown is a good place to pop into a few spots to find local flavors. The Orange Street Grocer serves coffee locals swear by, and across the street the tiny PRC Bakery serves some of the tastiest pastries on the island, from piping hot meat pies to dense and satisfying currant scones. Just down the road is Fisherman's Pub. Although the service can be gruff and it is often frequented by tourists, it presents one of the best opportunities to sample a wide range of Bajan home cooking. The cafeteria-style service lets you point at what you want, and you might find island specialties like flying fish and cou cou (a cornmeal and okra starch), pork stew or pickled avocado.
Before you end your exploration of Barbados, you'll counterintuitively want to stop by a place where you'll find hordes of other tourists -- and also hordes of locals: The Friday night fish fry in the town of Oistins, where you'll come across a group of kiosks selling both raw and cooked seafood.
On Fridays it turns into the hot spot on the island, with bands, karaoke and general merriment. Kids zoom around while parents wait in long lines to order fresh fish that they then watch grill over tall flames from the barbecues between tents. The most popular kiosk these days is Pat's Place, right on the main road, where deeply seasoned grilled marlin is accompanied by lightly fried slices of breadfruit, macaroni pie and sorrel -- hibiscus -- soda.
Once you've got your fish platter, you can sit down at the communal tables, perhaps with your new friends from the farmer's market, and enjoy the scene of a friendly, energized Barbados, driving toward independence.
If You Go
To explore Barbados on your own you can rent a car through Avis, Enterprise or Hertz, or by checking out the tourism ministry's contact list of local agencies. Prices vary by season, starting from about $ 50 a day before fees. If renting at the last minute during the high season (December to April) there will be limited availability, if any, so book ahead.
Driving can be challenging: Barbadians drive on the left-hand side, the roads often feature roundabouts and hazards like potholes or sheep, and, especially in the rural areas, signage is minimal.
Taxis are prevalent and easily arranged through hotels. Personal drivers can be hired on an hourly basis from several local companies such as RDH Group, for about $ 75 per hour for up to three passengers.
There is also public transportation, which is generally considered safe. Blue and yellow public buses run across the island, as do privately owned buses and white and maroon vans known locally as ZRs, since the license plates begin with a "Z-R." They often travel at high speeds down narrow roads, which may make some visitors uncomfortable. Tickets can be purchased on board for around $ 2.

France Leads the List Of the Global Ultrarich: [Correction]

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.
Mr. Arnault, 74, whose worldwide domain encompasses 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton handbags, Tiffany diamond rings, Christian Dior dresses and Sephora high-end cosmetics, leaped past American technology titans with a fortune estimated at $ 211 billion as of March 10, when the Forbes figures were tallied.
Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, 69, who has led the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest women for three straight years, had an estimated net worth of $ 80.5 billion. A granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder, she is on the company's board and together with her husband makes many of the controlling decisions. Her company's international cosmetics brands include Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline New York and Essie.
The eye-popping figures, which include the billionaires' personal holdings of company stocks, testify to the resilience of wealthy consumers against a cost-of-living crisis, as high earners continued to splurge on luxury goods -- especially in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. L'Oréal had global sales of over $ 38 billion last year, while LVMH had record revenue of $ 80 billion.
"More people are flocking to spending on luxury goods after having survived Covid lockdowns," said Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Bernstein. "The middle class did suffer and is hollowing out. But the wealthy were untouched, and the upper middle class is spending on all fronts."
High-flying technology companies, on the other hand, have faced a major reckoning over the past year amid a surge in interest rates, high inflation and uncertain economic conditions. Rapid growth during the pandemic has been followed by widespread layoffs, and a nearly 30 percent slump in tech shares last year cut sharply into the fortunes of Elon Musk, owner of Twitter and Tesla, and Amazon's executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Musk slipped to second place in Forbes's rankings, with an estimated fortune of $ 180 billion, and Mr. Bezos came in third with $ 114 billion.
The Forbes rankings caused a sensation in France this week, touching off a new round of headlines about income inequality and igniting debates over whether the ultrarich have augmented their fortunes by paying too little in taxes.
The country has been gripped by strikes and increasingly violent street demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension overhaul, which intends to raise the minimum age of retirement to 64 from 62. But the nationwide demonstrations -- another is scheduled for Thursday -- have also become rallying points for a broader protest over a glaring wealth divide. In France, the richest 10 percent hold nearly half of the country's wealth, and the growth of that share has outpaced that held by the rest of the population, according to the French statistics agency Insee. Wealth "remains very unevenly distributed among the population," the agency said.
Many of the protesters have made Mr. Arnault a main target for their ire, wielding unflattering posters and images of the multibillionaire as the symbol of a deeper problem afflicting the country.
"Mr. Arnault is seen as the embodiment of the ultrarich," said Philippe Escande, an economics columnist for the newspaper Le Monde. "But France is a country where equality -- namely 'liberté, égalité and fraternité' -- is very important, dating all the way back to the Revolution," he said. "There is a problem with money."
Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

The Men's Luxury Market Isn't What You Think: [Style Desk]

Full text: In a floor-through loft in SoHo one Friday night in January, Vincent Ferraro was selling luxury clothing. Sort of.
On one side of the room, a tattoo artist covered a young woman's palm in an illustration of a bankroll. Some people flipped casually through the racks of Chrome Hearts and Enfants Riches Déprimés, but Mr. Ferraro -- sinewy, with a shaved head and covered in tattoos -- didn't pay them much mind. Instead, he poured shots of Patrón, posed for Instagram photos and occasionally disappeared with one of the several women who had come to vie for his attention.
On the men's resale clothing site Grailed, Mr. Ferraro, who before the pandemic worked in nightlife, most recently as general manager and creative director of Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, sells under the handle 4GSELLER, and in the last couple of years, has become the go-to for rare Chrome Hearts, recent-season Louis Vuitton statement pieces and thrashed vintage dirtbag T-shirts, building a business that he says has annual revenue in the low seven figures.
"I did take, like, a big page out of what I did hospitality-wise and integrate it into what I'm doing," Mr. Ferraro, 32, said a few weeks before the party, relaxing in the showroom one afternoon in a Yankees fitted cap, white T-shirt and Louis Vuitton ski pants. On the couch next to him he had a small pile of new Chrome Hearts inventory, and one piece in particular stood out: heavyweight black leather cargo pants with exaggerated pockets and built-to-last hardware.
The pants had an original retail price, he said, of around $ 6,000 to $ 7,000, but he was planning on listing them for north of $ 20,000. "The guy who got these waited a year," he noted, referring to the sometimes lengthy wait for Chrome Hearts orders. "But people aren't coming here to wait a year. They're coming to walk out with them right now. So there's a value to that."
Still, $ 20,000 is a few mortgage payments, a diamond necklace, a painting, maybe a small car. Is there no sticker shock?
"I sold three of these already," he said, not even blinking.
Welcome to the wild world of men's luxury resale, which has begun to boom in recent years, owing in large part to the graduation of the young male customer who came of age in the era of limited-edition sneakers and Supreme items as asset classes, and for whom hip-hop icons and sports superstars are also high-fashion heroes.
All of those trends have primed the pump for the luxury men's resale market, which is broadening rapidly, a growth captured in sellers like Mr. Ferraro; Justin Reed, whose Los Angeles showroom has become a celebrity playpen; and Luke Fracher, something of a modern garmento, who recently opened Luke's, the first buy-sell-trade shop in New York for this generation of men's luxury clothing.
"We're seeing the streetwear-ification of high-end," Mr. Fracher said over dinner in January at Ludlow House in Manhattan, a few blocks from his narrow-corridor shop just north of Dimes Square. Which is to say that the category of current men's luxury isn't Loro Piana and Kiton, but rather Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga, Chrome Hearts and Rick Owens, rare Nikes and archival Raf Simons.
That evolution has been unfolding for more than a decade. There's an explicit through line from Riccardo Tisci's invigoration of Givenchy in the early 2010s to Alessandro Michele's psychedelic-tapestry rebrand of Gucci, to Kim Jones's streamlining of Dior to, of course, Virgil Abloh's up-from-spare-parts reconstruction of Louis Vuitton. And by remaking Nike and Vuitton simultaneously, Mr. Abloh implicitly linked their audiences, making clear that a luxury item is something people are willing to splurge on, regardless of which company made it.
Mr. Fracher, 34, was a founder of the Round Two empire, which during the 2010s turned the secondhand T-shirt trade into a multimillion-dollar concern with nine locations in five cities. He left Round Two last year and opened Luke's in December, betting that some of the customer base that cut its teeth on streetwear and sneakers would be ready to upgrade to something fancier.
He also pointed to how insatiable social media feeds have created persistent and renewable demand for luxury clothing. "First of all, it's the homogenization of how everyone dresses in every city across the world," he said, emphasizing how clothing has become a globally spoken language. "And then it's the need to flex nonstop and the need to have new clothing all the time, so you can post fit pics and get the dopamine hit and hopefully get some clout off it."
Because he buys his inventory outright and has little room for storage, Mr. Fracher wants to move product quickly, most likely leaving him with thinner margins than those of Mr. Ferraro or Mr. Reed, who operate as showrooms with online presence.
Mr. Reed's space, in a warehouse building in the downtown Los Angeles arts district, is bucolic and soothing, almost spalike. At the center of the main room sits a four-section de Sede Terrazza sofa from the early 1970s, still in its original beige leather, that he bought from a Hollywood producer. It's been a fixture on his Instagram for a few years, giving him a unique, sophisticated visual identity as his website, which he started in 2017, was getting on its feet.
Now Mr. Reed, 35, is one of the most trusted names in men's luxury resale. At his showroom, which during a December visit was decorated with a Givenchy surfboard, artwork by Joyce Pensato and a bench from the spring 2022 Louis Vuitton runway show, he entertains celebrity clients like the boxer Gervonta Davis, the Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs, the longtime fashion plate Luka Sabbat and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, point guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, all memorialized in a wall of Polaroids. (Mr. Reed said that only about a quarter of his business comes from celebrity clients.)
Mr. Reed, in a St. John's hoodie -- his alma mater -- and Balenciaga Strike boots, described himself as "a self-taught street kid." Born and raised in New York, he sold photocopiers door to door before beginning to resell sneakers online in the mid-2010s. Once he began focusing on luxury men's items, he effectively helped make the marketplace thanks to a sleek web presence and a reputation for sourcing rare pieces. Last year, he sold one of the only known jackets by Pastelle, an early Kanye West brand, to Kim Kardashian. Like Mr. Ferraro, he does brisk trade in Chrome Hearts, especially odd, rare items like a leather case for jumper cables, or a weight bench.
Unlike Mr. Ferraro, he runs most of his business on consignment -- his 2022 revenue was approximately $ 8 million, he said, roughly doubling each year since 2019. His average website order is $ 1,300, he said, and around 100,000 people visit his site each month with almost no advertising.
Broadly speaking, hip-hop is to thank. Rappers began to embrace luxury fashion in the 1990s and 2000s just as the genre was muscling its way to the center of American pop music. By the 2000s, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams were deepening the ties between music and fashion, making way for the generation of ASAP Rocky and Tyler, the Creator, followed by Travis Scott and Playboi Carti. (This attitude has spilled over into professional sports, especially basketball and football, where players are now routinely filmed and photographed in the outfits they arrive at games wearing.)
In a way, high-fashion items have supplanted the rapper chain as the de rigueur splashy purchase. "You got to be dripped out to show people like, 'Hey, I'm here and I'm going to wear $ 10,000 jeans, drag 'em on the ground, and I'm going to make more money,"' Mr. Ferraro said.
By the mid-2010s, being a fan of hip-hop almost implicitly meant becoming a style aficionado, and starting to learn to dress the part. Around the same time, Grailed was introduced, formalizing a chaotic web of sales that mostly took place in online forums and building a true, transparent marketplace out of what had largely been hand-to-hand transactions. Furthermore, no longer did someone have to speak in the specific argot of forum loyalists in order to have access to rare product.
Arun Gupta, the co-founder and chief executive of Grailed -- which last year was acquired by the GOAT Group, which also owns the sneaker reseller Flight Club -- said that sales of luxury clothing had grown year over year, thanks to increased customer education.
"The level of knowledge has gone crazy," Mr. Gupta said. "The number of fashion brands that the average fashion person knows has probably 10x'd. Self-expression in the '90s was your CD collection, but in the 2020s, it's about your closet."
Before Grailed, to the extent that there was luxury resale for men's clothing at all, it was limited to consignment shops, like the one Ina Bernstein opened on Thompson Street in Manhattan in the early 1990s. Originally, she did not carry men's clothing in her namesake store. Eventually, some trickled in -- suits and ties, Armani and Calvin Klein, maybe a little Yohji. By the mid-1990s, she had opened a small men's-only storefront on Mott Street. Customers were dedicated, but scant. Men weren't quite ready. "It was very weird for them to think about trying on someone else's clothes," she said in a phone interview last month.
But the social conventions of male dress were on the verge of disruption. Soon, luxury houses were making more than officewear for men, and a wider swath of male consumers took an interest in expensive clothes. Ms. Bernstein's customer base widened accordingly, she said: "It's drastically changed. Many men who do not work in the fashion business, never went to art school. They're just walking-down-the-street men, and they all love fashion."
Even just a decade ago, the audience for some of the rarer men's luxury items was almost comically small. Alex Kasavin, before opening Idol in Brooklyn in 2014, resold niche high-end men's clothing, like Carol Christian Poell and early Rick Owens, through a showroom called the Gray Market beginning in 2012. "There was a time with those brands, for these key pieces, I would know almost every owner," Mr. Kasavin said. "There wasn't a whole generation that grew up on it. Now there is, and that generation has buying power."
It also has a robust understanding of how clothing in this category holds its value. "It's like buying stocks now," Mr. Gupta said, adding that expensive purchases now involve less risk because of the stability of the resale market.
This growing market is also attracting the attention of luxury brands and retailers. Mr. Reed said that he had been approached by larger fashion players interested in forming a partnership with him: "I think I can be the Barneys of the secondary market."
Mr. Ferraro, for his part, would rather remain niche. "I'm not trying to be, like, a $ 50 million business," he said. "I'm trying to stay genuine to the products." He sells across the modern luxury spectrum, including Saint Laurent and "Decarnin-era only" Balmain, but Chrome Hearts is his bread and butter and, in a way, his public persona. He is effectively a stand-in for his customer base, which includes rappers like Lil Tecca, rockers like Travis Barker, and athletes like Odell Beckham Jr. and Travis Kelce, who stopped by Mr. Ferraro's showroom not long after his Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last month.
"Tecca or Odell will come here, and we'll go out after," Mr. Ferraro said. "And then we'll come back here, and they'll buy clothes." He once was summoned to Offset and Cardi B's home on Father's Day to show Cardi some rare Chrome Hearts pieces. He has even sold vintage Chrome Hearts to Kristian Stark, scion of the brand's family.
But he's not precious, believing that even at these perilous prices, these garments are meant to be worn. The day before the interview, a handyman had been in the showroom doing some work. "We had the TaskRabbit in Chrome!" Mr. Ferraro exulted.
Mr. Fracher said that Mr. Ferraro's casual roisterousness was central to his appeal. "I knew Vincent from Rose Bar," Mr. Fracher said. "He used to comp us tables and bottles. He's a psycho like me. Vinny is, like, almost like a fashion house designer. Like, he reminds me of Hedi or Demna, in the sense that he built a lifestyle and then portrays it." (Nightlife is in Mr. Ferraro's blood -- one of his uncles is Ron Galella.)
Mr. Reed, on the other hand, is "like a jeweler," Mr. Fracher said. Of the three sellers, Mr. Reed's business is the biggest, and his attention to the market is finely detailed. He's made a few micro-markets in recent years, getting in early on the Chrome Hearts denim resurgence and selling some of the only Prada collaborations with Frank Ocean's luxury brand Homer that have hit the resale market.
What the ceiling for this luxury resale marketplace may be is yet to be determined. Clothes are increasingly detached from scene and subculture, so there are many more style propositions in demand at any given moment. But there's only so much product of this level being manufactured, and only some of it is in circulation at any given time.
"The athletes, the entertainers -- they hold, they don't want to sell," Mr. Reed said. "What I think they like is having a closet that's like a store."
Often, Mr. Reed and Mr. Fracher find themselves selling to other resellers in different cities, or with different clienteles. "Part of what keeps the market propped up is that so many people see what those guys are doing and want to do it," Mr. Kasavin said.
If Mr. Ferraro is a lifestyle ambassador and Mr. Reed is an asset manager, then Mr. Fracher is a yenta. A freewheeling presence on TikTok and Instagram, blending his thorough knowledge of the marketplace with a sense of wry exasperation, it sometimes feels as if he is advertising clothes by indicating how preposterous he finds them. To sit with him over a few afternoons of haggling is to become lightly unromantic about the purported exclusivity of luxury clothing. Expensive items, some rare, seemed to walk in out of nowhere.
"Luke is really the new Ina," Mr. Kasavin said.
Mr. Fracher traded two smallish Rick Owens jackets for a few Balenciaga pieces from a fashion hound wearing an early Vetements hoodie. One man tried to sell him the Enfants Riches Déprimés hoodie off his back, but couldn't agree on a price. Someone came in to offload a shirt from Yeezy Season 5. "No one is buying that," Mr. Fracher shrugged.
Seeing these expensive items treated so casually threatened to undermine the concept of luxury itself. If everyone is dressing up, then is anyone really dressing up? But it also suggested the true circularity of the marketplace, the scale of available supply, and the potential for endlessly renewable demand, even in the face of a possible recession.
Mr. Fracher is not overly preoccupied by these philosophical concerns, though. "I think as the real wealth gap keeps growing, more and more normal people are going to want to cosplay as rich people, and this is the easiest way to do so," he said. "I'll be here for them."

Offering No Apologies, Macron Weathers Pension Crisis: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Amid protests in the streets and in Parliament, the French leader shows no sign of scrapping a law that raises the retirement age.
PARIS -- President Emmanuel Macron's re-election program last year was short on detail. His mind seemed elsewhere, chiefly on the war in Ukraine. But on one thing he was clear: He would raise the retirement age in France to 65 from 62.
"You will have to work progressively more," he said during a debate in April 2022 with the extreme-right candidate, Marine Le Pen. She attacked the idea as "an absolutely unbearable injustice" that would condemn French people to retirement "when they are no longer able to enjoy it."
France heard both candidates. Soon after, Mr. Macron was re-elected with 58.55 percent of the vote to Ms. Le Pen's 41.45 percent. It was a clear victory, and it was clear what Mr. Macron would do on the question of pensions.
Yet his ramming the overhaul through Parliament last week without a full vote on the bill itself culminated in turmoil, mayhem on the streets and two failed no-confidence votes against his government on Monday, even as polls have consistently shown about 65 percent of French people are opposed to raising the retirement age.
Had they not heard him? Had they changed their minds? Had circumstances changed? Perhaps the answer lies, above all, in the nature of Mr. Macron's victory, as he himself acknowledged on election night last year.
Looking somber, speaking in an uncharacteristically flat monotone, Mr. Macron told a crowd of supporters in Paris: "I also know that a number of our compatriots voted for me today not to support the ideas that I uphold, but to block the extreme right. I want to thank them and say that I am aware that I have obligations toward them in the years to come."
"Those 'obligations' could only be a promise to negotiate on major reforms," Nicole Bacharan, a social scientist, said on Tuesday. "He did not negotiate, even with moderate union leaders. What I see now is Macron's complete disconnection from the country."
Opposition parties on both the left and the right have vowed to file challenges against the pension law before the Constitutional Council, which reviews legislation to ensure it complies with the French Constitution.
"The goal," said Thomas Ménagé of Ms. Le Pen's National Rally party, "is to ensure that this text falls into the dustbin of history."
But the chances of that appear remote.
After a long silence, Mr. Macron is set to address the turmoil on Wednesday. He will try to conciliate; he will, according to officials close to him, portray the current standoff as a battle between democratic institutions and the chaos of the street, orchestrated by the extreme left and slyly encouraged by the extreme right. He has decided to stick with his current government, led by Élisabeth Borne, the prime minister, and he will not dissolve Parliament or call new elections, they say.
In short, it seems Mr. Macron has decided to tough out the crisis, perhaps offering some blandishments on improving vocational high schools and broader on-the-job training. But certainly no apology appears to be forthcoming for using a legal tool, Article 49.3 of the Constitution, to avoid a full parliamentary vote on a change that has split the country. (Only the Senate, the upper house, voted to pass the bill this month.)
This approach appears consistent with Mr. Macron's chosen tactics on the pension overhaul. Since the debate with Ms. Le Pen 11 months ago, inflation has risen, energy prices have gone up, and the pressures, particularly on the poorer sectors of French society, have grown.
Yet, while he has made some concessions, including setting the new retirement age at 64 rather than 65, Mr. Macron has remained remote from the rolling anger. Most conspicuously, and to many inexplicably, after the government consulted extensively with unions in the run-up to January, Mr. Macron has refused to negotiate with the powerful moderate union leader Laurent Berger, who had supported Mr. Macron's earlier attempt at pension changes in 2019 but opposes him now.
"Macron knows the economy better than he knows political psychology," said Alain Duhamel, a political scientist. "And today, what you have is a generalized fury."
A large number of Macron voters, it is now clear, never wanted the retirement age raised. They heard Mr. Macron during the debate with Ms. Le Pen. They just did not loathe his idea enough to vote for a nationalist, anti-immigrant ideologue whose party was financed in part by Russian loans.
Mr. Macron is adept at playing on such contradictions and divisions. Because his presidential term is limited, he is freer to do as he pleases. He knows three things: He will not be a candidate for re-election in 2027 because a third consecutive term is not permitted; the opposition in Parliament is strong but irreconcilably divided between the far left and extreme right; and there is a large, silent slice of French society that supports his pension overhaul.
All this gives him room to maneuver even in his current difficult situation.
When Mr. Macron opted last week for the 49.3 and the avoidance of a parliamentary vote, he explained his decision this way: "I consider that in the current state of affairs the financial and economic risks are too great."
On the face of it, speaking about risks to financial markets while pushing through an overhaul deeply resented by blue-collar and working-class French people seemed politically gauche. It appeared especially so at a moment when Mr. Macron was turning away from the full parliamentary vote his government had unanimously said it wanted.
"Saying what he said about finance at that moment, in that context, was just dynamite," said Ms. Bacharan.
It was also an unmistakable wink to the powerful French private sector -- with its world-class companies like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton -- and to the many affluent and middle-class French people who do not like the growing piles of uncollected garbage or the protests in the streets, and who view retirement at 62 as an unsustainable anomaly in a Europe where the retirement age has generally risen to 65 or higher.
If Mr. Macron has cards to play, and perhaps broader support than is evident as protesters hurl insults at him day after day, his very disconnection may make it hard for him to judge the country's mood.
Last week, Aurore Bergé, the leader of Mr. Macron's Renaissance party in Parliament, wrote to Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, to request police protection for lawmakers.
"I refuse to see representatives from my group, or any national lawmaker, afraid to express themselves, or to vote freely, because they are afraid of reprisals," she said.
It was a measure of the violent mood in France.
"If we have had 15 Constitutions over the past two centuries, that means there have been 14 revolutions of various kinds," Mr. Duhamel said. "There is an eruptive side to France that one should not ignore."

Looking somber, speaking in an uncharacteristically flat monotone, Macron told a crowd of supporters in Paris: “I also know that a number of our compatriots voted for me today not to support the ideas that I uphold, but to block the extreme right. I want to thank them and say that I am aware that I have obligations toward them in the years to come.”
“Those ‘obligations’ could only be a promise to negotiate on major reforms,” Nicole Bacharan, a social scientist, said Tuesday. “He did not negotiate, even with moderate union leaders. What I see now is Macron’s complete disconnection from the country.”
Opposition parties on the left and the right have vowed to file challenges against the pension law before the Constitutional Council, which reviews legislation to ensure it complies with the French Constitution.
“The goal,” said Thomas Ménagé of Le Pen’s National Rally party, “is to ensure that this text falls into the dustbin of history.”
But the chances of that appear remote.
After a long silence, Macron is set to address the turmoil Wednesday. He will try to conciliate; he will, according to officials close to him, portray the current standoff as a battle between democratic institutions and the chaos of the street, orchestrated by the extreme left and slyly encouraged by the extreme right. He has decided to stick with his current government, led by Élisabeth Borne, the prime minister, and he will not dissolve Parliament or call new elections, they say.
In short, it seems Macron has decided to tough out the crisis, perhaps offering some blandishments on improving vocational high schools and broader on-the-job training. But certainly no apology appears to be forthcoming for using a legal tool, Article 49.3 of the constitution, to avoid a full parliamentary vote on a change that has split the country. (Only the Senate, the upper house, voted to pass the bill this month.)
This approach appears consistent with Macron’s chosen tactics on the pension overhaul. Since the debate with Le Pen 11 months ago, inflation has risen, energy prices have gone up and the pressures, particularly on the poorer sectors of French society, have grown.
Yet, while he has made some concessions, including setting the new retirement age at 64 rather than 65, Macron has remained remote from the rolling anger. Most conspicuously, and to many inexplicably, after the government consulted extensively with unions in the run-up to January, Macron has refused to negotiate with powerful moderate union leader Laurent Berger, who had supported Macron’s earlier attempt at pension changes in 2019 but opposes him now.
“Macron knows the economy better than he knows political psychology,” said Alain Duhamel, a political scientist. “And today, what you have is a generalized fury.”
A large number of Macron voters, it is now clear, never wanted the retirement age raised. They heard Macron during the debate with Le Pen. They just did not loathe his idea enough to vote for a nationalist, anti-immigrant ideologue whose party was financed in part by Russian loans.
Macron is adept at playing on such contradictions and divisions. Because his presidential term is limited, he is freer to do as he pleases. He knows three things: He will not be a candidate for reelection in 2027 because a third consecutive term is not permitted; the opposition in Parliament is strong but irreconcilably divided between the far left and extreme right; and there is a large, silent slice of French society that supports his pension overhaul.
All this gives him room to maneuver even in his current difficult situation.
When Macron opted last week for Article 49.3 and the avoidance of a parliamentary vote, he explained his decision this way: “I consider that in the current state of affairs, the financial and economic risks are too great.”
On the face of it, speaking about risks to financial markets while pushing through an overhaul deeply resented by blue-collar and working-class French people seemed politically gauche. It appeared especially so at a moment when Macron was turning away from the full parliamentary vote his government had unanimously said it wanted.
“Saying what he said about finance at that moment, in that context, was just dynamite,” Bacharan said.
It was also an unmistakable wink to the powerful French private sector — with its world-class companies like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — and to the many affluent and middle-class French people who do not like the growing piles of uncollected garbage or the protests in the streets, and who view retirement at 62 as an unsustainable anomaly in a Europe where the retirement age has generally risen to 65 or higher.
If Macron has cards to play, and perhaps broader support than is evident as protesters hurl insults at him day after day, his very disconnection may make it hard for him to judge the country’s mood.
Last week, Aurore Bergé, the leader of Macron’s Renaissance party in Parliament, wrote to Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, to request police protection for lawmakers.
“I refuse to see representatives from my group, or any national lawmaker, afraid to express themselves, or to vote freely, because they are afraid of reprisals,” she said.
It was a measure of the violent mood in France.
“If we have had 15 constitutions over the past two centuries, that means there have been 14 revolutions of various kinds,” Duhamel said. “There is an eruptive side to France that one should not ignore.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Footwear News Achievement Awards, sometimes called the Oscars of shoes, shines a spotlight on the industry's top designers. But when the singer Dua Lipa won for a Puma collection last November, her frequent collaborator Billy Walsh bolted at the sight of flashing cameras.
"Billy Walsh's five-seconds limit on the red carpet," Ms. Lipa said, as photographers shouted her name at Cipriani Wall Street.
"More like two seconds," Mr. Walsh, 40, added safely from the sidelines.
Avoiding attention is a peculiar trait for a man who collaborates with some of the biggest names in pop, including Ms. Lipa, Post Malone and the Weeknd, straddling the upper echelons of fashion and music.
He has collaborated with Rihanna on a Fenty collection with Puma, and consulted Kanye West on video directors. As a fashion stylist, he dressed the Weeknd in Givenchy for the Met gala and James Blake in Yohji Yamamoto for awards shows.
But his biggest achievements are in songwriting. His co-writing credits include "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee, and six tracks on Mr. West's "Donda" album -- and those are just counting his Grammy nominations.
"Billy is part of a small group of people in this industry that I consider to be like family," Mr. Malone said by email. Their shared writing catalog also includes the hits "I Fall Apart," "Better Now," "Wow" and "Circles." "Not only is he one of the best songwriters, but he is a brilliant creative and fashion designer."
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Walsh went shopping at Dover Street Market, the retail temple in Manhattan where he often goes for inspiration. "I would come here to do massive pulls for the Weeknd," he said. "I used to start on the top floor and work my way down."
He still does. As he flipped through racks of Raf Simons and Junya Watanabe on the seventh floor, Mr. Walsh recounted this unorthodox rise in the recording and street wear industries. "Fashion and music are definitely interrelated, but I guess I don't know too many people who have succeeded in both," he said. "I stay in the back and don't need credit."
Dressed in an all-black "uniform" (T-shirt, Prada nylon shorts, Alyx socks and Nike Air Tuned Max sneakers), with his signature shaved head and platinum veneers, he has the tough-guy appearance of a post-apocalyptic British rude boy.
Mr. Walsh credits his dexterity to his rough-and-tumble upbringing in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. His father, William Walsh, a folk musician who performed at local Irish pubs, encouraged him to write poetry and dance. He was also an obsessive sneaker head. "I drove my mom crazy looking all over the city for the Adidas Equipment Basketball shoes with the interchangeable, different-colored socks," he said.
Other addictions followed. He started drinking at 11, often getting into after-school brawls until he sobered up a decade later.
At 18, he headed to Los Angeles to study dance at Loyola Marymount University, and signed with an agent. But dance gigs were few and far between, so he spent most of his 20s as a nightclub promoter, working alongside his brother at Hollywood hot spots like Emerson Theater and Hyde, where he would party with a young Post Malone and future designers like Matthew M. Williams of Givenchy.
In 2011, the choreographer Fatima Robinson, who he met at Eden, a Hollywood nightclub, encouraged him to stop dancing and focus on poetry and design instead. "This woman literally saved my life," he said.
He quit auditioning and busied himself with writing poetry and daydreaming about street wear. He looked inside his sneaker closet and began experimenting with Frankenstein combinations. One of the first designs cobbled together was a white Nike Air Force One with a black rubber creeper sole. "I always wondered what a creeper would look like with certain old sneakers from my childhood," he said.
He wore his custom sneakers to the clubs, which would get noticed by emerging V.I.P.s like Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott. In 2014, with seed money from fellow party promoters, he and a friend started a street wear label called Mr. Completely, which reimagined classic sneakers including Adidas Sambas and Stan Smiths.
To promote the brand, he held a party at Fourtwofour on Fairfax and invited everyone he knew. Among them was the stylist Jahleel Weaver, who ordered several pairs for his client Rihanna. That turned out to be a propitious sale. A few months later, Rihanna invited Mr. Walsh to design her debut collection with Puma (which went on to win the Footwear News "Shoe of the Year" two years later).
Sneakers opened other doors. One of them led to Illangelo, a veteran Canadian producer, who became a confidant and his unexpected entree into music writing. Once again, it started at a nightclub. The two were clubbing on the Sunset Strip in 2014 when Illangelo mentioned that he was disappointed by the state of songwriting. Seizing the moment, Mr. Walsh shared a short poem from his iPhone Notes app.
Illangelo was so impressed that he brought Mr. Walsh into studio sessions with Alicia Keys and he ended up getting his first mainstream writing credit on the song, "In Common." Illangelo also introduced Mr. Walsh to the Weeknd, who at first was only interested in working with him as a stylist. (The two shared an appreciation for military bomber jackets.) But as Mr. Walsh's reputation as a songwriter began to rise, the Weeknd began bringing him into the studio.
Those sessions resulted in three tracks from the 2016 album‌‌ "Starboy," including "True Colors" and "Die ‌for You," which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 this month, seven years after it was first released, thanks to going viral on TikTok.
Mr. Walsh has since gone on to write more than 100 songs for artists as varied as the Kid Laroi ("Without You"), pop powerhouses like Mr. Malone and Ms. Lipa, and rock royalty like Ozzy Osbourne ("Ordinary Man"). His publishing catalog has racked up a combined 20 billion streams. Last November, "Sunflower" went 17 times platinum, becoming the highest-certified single of all time.
His soaring music career hasn't stopped him from other creative pursuits. In 2016, he started Donavan's Yard, a nightlife collective in Los Angeles with the D.J.s Drew Byrd and Sean G that hosts parties in Tokyo and a streaming concert series on Amazon Music Live. Branded merch is sold at Dover Street Market,
In October, he started a conceptual street wear label called Iswas with Keith Richardson, his creative partner at Mr. Completely. The label currently sells one item: a pair of painter's pants made from Japanese selvage denim that costs $ 450.
Wearing many hats, Mr. Walsh said, affords him creative freedom. "If Abel knows I am winning an award with Dua and doing my own clothing line, he respects that I'm doing OK for myself," he said, referring to the Weeknd by his given name. "No one feels like you're too dependent."
Back at Dover Street, Mr. Walsh went from floor to floor, examining the clothing racks like an archaeologist at a fresh dig. On the shoe floor, he picked up a pair of cloven-toed "tabi" boots by Martin Margiela. "I appreciate what this guy does," he said of the designer, who, like himself, shuns the limelight in favor of letting his work speak for itself.
After about two hours, he reached the Rose Bakery on the ground floor, took a seat and ordered an Earl Grey tea. As ambient music played overhead, he reflected on his unusual journey. "My success comes from artists recognizing that I see the creative process as sacred, somewhat secret," he said. "I am never the main focus, just as it should be."

French Shopkeepers Are Siding With Pension Protesters: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Angry protests over a plan to raise France's retirement age pile uncertainty on small businesses, but most are siding with the demonstrators.
Maxime Clausier stood inside the barricaded entrance of his butcher shop in central Paris and surveyed the swelling crowd of protesters outside his door. He had closed early Tuesday amid the latest demonstrations in France against President Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the legal age of retirement to 64 from 62, and his business was taking a hit.
But Mr. Clausier said he would have given anything to be right out there in the crowd. Even at age 30, having worked nearly half his life as a butcher, he couldn't stomach the idea of being required to work longer to finance what the government says may soon be an untenable pension system.
"I can't afford to be out there for even five hours," said Mr. Clausier, who helps run La Boucherie des Gobelins and pays what he said were high payroll taxes used to fund France's social safety net. "But I'm with them in spirit, because what we are seeing is the unraveling of France's social contract. We can't let that happen."
Tens of thousands of people marched past Mr. Clausier's shop on the Avenue des Gobelins on Tuesday, following a snaking four-kilometer route that started at the Place d'Italie and coursed along the main arteries of Paris's Left Bank, all the way to Napoleon's tomb at the Invalides.
In cities stretching from Lille in northern France to Marseille in the south, for the second time in two weeks, throngs took to the streets in a show of anger set off by Mr. Macron's pension overhaul plans.
Mr. Macron, who made changes to the pension system a cornerstone of his re-election campaign last year, argues that he has a strong mandate and that France's complex but generous state-backed retirement plan will run out of money if nothing is done. The only way to fix it, Mr. Macron says, is to make the French work longer.
Opponents, including a united front of labor unions, say Mr. Macron is attacking a cherished right to retire and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy. Neither side has shown signs of backing down.
Near the front of the marchers, Eileen Nati positioned her wheeled food stand in the middle of the growing crowd, where hungry protesters paid 5 euros, about $ 5.40, for sizzling merguez sausage sandwiches. The family business -- her husband, Mohammed, and father, Said, tended to two other stands across the street -- is part of a satellite economy of food and pamphlet vendors who follow nearly every major protest movement that breaks out across France.
"We make decent money," said Ms. Nati, 29, whose father started out with a tiny barbecue cart over 40 years ago, rising at 5 a.m., laboring over wood fires and crisscrossing the country in a truck in search of business.
The work allowed the family to get by, but it also took a toll on family life. "We want to be able to profit from life with our children and grandchildren," Ms. Nati said. "So I support this movement. We pay taxes to fund the system, and to force us to work longer to benefit from what we've put in isn't right."
To the raucous Parisians parading along the Avenue des Gobelins, the pension overhaul was the latest sign that Mr. Macron was out of touch with people. They shouted into megaphones, chanted antigovernment slogans and railed against what many saw as a growing inequality divide between average workers and the superrich in France and around the world.
Many of the businesspeople watching the crowds from inside their shops agreed.
A few doors down from Mr. Clausier's butcher shop, Arnaud Tourneboeuf, 59, sat quietly in the designer Scandinavian furniture boutique where he sells custom shelving units. Only a handful of customers had stopped in since the morning, but he wasn't worried. People who could afford big-ticket items would come back another day.
Even so, his eyes darted to the ever-thickening crowd, where protesters wielded signs reading "Retirement before death" and caroused satirically to the French disco song "Born to Be Alive," a tongue-in-cheek reference to Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, who is leading Mr. Macron's reform drive.
Mr. Tourneboeuf acknowledged that France's current retirement age was one of the lowest in Europe. "If Scandinavian countries, Germany, Spain and everyone else has raised it, it must mean something needs to be done," he said. "Even so," he added, "we are spending enormous sums on France's defense budget" in light of Russia's war against Ukraine. "There surely must be another way to find money for pensions."
As the crowd got louder, Mr. Tourneboeuf grew somber. "What's happening here is not merely a protest about the retirement age," he said. "Everywhere we are seeing more and more evidence of inequality, tilting in favor the powerful. Two hundred years after the French Revolution, it's as if society has not become more equal."
Mr. Tourneboeuf also said Mr. Macron's policies were a continuation of neoliberal economic prescriptions that had already contributed to inequality for decades. If France's Yellow Vest movement was sparked by an attempt by Mr. Macron to raise gas taxes on people who could least afford it, the president's latest gambit to raise the retirement age is igniting "an immaterial anger," he said.
Such talk didn't resonate with everyone. Farther along, where the avenue dipped to reveal the stunning profile in the distance of the Pantheon, Emmanuel Schoemann stood behind the counter of his empty video game shop and watched the crowds file by.
A nearly full-scale shutdown of Paris's transit system, a strike in sympathy with the retirement-age protest, had kept his clientele away. "I've had only four customers since this morning," he said.
Mr. Schoemann, 41, couldn't understand why the thousands of people walking past his store were protesting. Despite France's flaws, he said, it generally protects people of all stripes with a social safety net that would be envied in most other parts of the world.
The pension system is a prime example, he said, calling it one of the most protective in Europe. "The strikers have a hard time facing reality," he said. "They should look at our neighbors and realize that France is actually pretty generous."
But for others, the pension overhaul has come to symbolize a deeper problem afflicting the country. Standing outside a BNP Paribas bank whose windows were boarded up was a man dressed like Mr. Monopoly, sporting a black top hat and white silk scarf and chomping on a cigar.
The man, Hubert Labrousse, a retiree and a member of Attac, a French anti-globalization movement, was making a point. He stretched his arm toward a poster of Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods company, who recently surpassed Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to become the world's richest man.
"He belongs to the gang of profiteers," Mr. Labrousse said. With a fortune estimated at over $ 200 billion by Forbes, Mr. Arnault was a main target of many protesters after LVMH last week reported record revenue of nearly €80 billion and net profit of over €14 billion, fueling a debate in French news media about the outsize wealth divide.
"Macron says we must not tax surplus profits or raise taxes on the 1 percent," said Evelyne Dourille-Feer, 72, a retired economist working with Mr. Labrousse. "Meanwhile, the number of people living under the poverty line in France has grown, and the poorest people are growing really poor," she said.
"Where is the social justice?" she asked.

PARIS — Maxime Clausier stood inside the barricaded entrance of his butcher shop in central Paris and surveyed the swelling crowd of protesters outside his door. He had closed early Tuesday amid the latest demonstrations in France against President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the legal age of retirement to 64 from 62, and his business was taking a hit.
But Clausier said he would have given anything to be right out there in the crowd. Even at age 30, having worked nearly half his life as a butcher, he couldn’t stomach the idea of being required to work longer to finance what the government says may soon be an untenable pension system.

We can’t let that happen.”
Tens of thousands of people marched past Clausier’s shop on the Avenue des Gobelins on Tuesday, following a snaking 4-kilometer route that started at the Place d’Italie and coursed along the main arteries of Paris’ Left Bank, all the way to Napoleon’s tomb at the Invalides.

Such talk didn’t resonate with everyone. Farther along, where the avenue dipped to reveal the stunning profile in the distance of the Pantheon, Emmanuel Schoemann stood behind the counter of his empty video game shop and watched the crowds file by.
A nearly full-scale shutdown of Paris’ transit system, a strike in sympathy with the retirement-age protest, had kept his clientele away. “I’ve had only four customers since this morning,” he said.
Schoemann, 41, couldn’t understand why the thousands of people walking past his store were protesting. Despite France’s flaws, he said, it generally protects people of all stripes with a social safety net that would be envied in most other parts of the world.
The pension system is a prime example, he said, calling it one of the most protective in Europe. “The strikers have a hard time facing reality,” he said. “They should look at our neighbors and realize that France is actually pretty generous.”
But for others, the pension overhaul has come to symbolize a deeper problem afflicting the country. Standing outside a BNP Paribas bank whose windows were boarded up was a man dressed like Mr. Monopoly, sporting a black top hat and white silk scarf and chomping on a cigar.
The man, Hubert Labrousse, a retiree and a member of Attac, a French anti-globalization movement, was making a point. He stretched his arm toward a poster of Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods company, who recently surpassed Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to become the world’s richest man.
“He belongs to the gang of profiteers,” Labrousse said. With a fortune estimated at more than $200 billion by Forbes, Arnault was a main target of many protesters after LVMH last week reported record revenue of nearly 80 billion euros and net profit of over 14 billion euros, fueling a debate in French news media about the outsize wealth divide.
“Macron says we must not tax surplus profits or raise taxes on the 1%,” said Evelyne Dourille-Feer, 72, a retired economist working with Labrousse. “Meanwhile, the number of people living under the poverty line in France has grown, and the poorest people are growing really poor,” she said.
“Where is the social justice?” she asked.

NEW YORK — The Footwear News Achievement Awards, sometimes called the Oscars of shoes, shines a spotlight on the industry’s top designers. But when singer Dua Lipa won for a Puma collection in November, her frequent collaborator Billy Walsh bolted at the sight of flashing cameras.
“Billy Walsh’s 5-seconds limit on the red carpet,” Lipa said, as photographers shouted her name at Cipriani Wall Street.
“More like 2 seconds,” Walsh, 40, added safely from the sidelines.
Avoiding attention is a peculiar trait for a man who collaborates with some of the biggest names in pop, including Lipa, Post Malone and The Weeknd, straddling the upper echelons of fashion and music.
He has collaborated with Rihanna on a Fenty collection with Puma, and consulted Kanye West on video directors. As a fashion stylist, he dressed The Weeknd in Givenchy for the Met gala and James Blake in Yohji Yamamoto for awards shows.
But his biggest achievements are in songwriting. His co-writing credits include “Sunflower” by Malone and Swae Lee, and six tracks on West’s “Donda” album — and those are just counting his Grammy nominations.
“Billy is part of a small group of people in this industry that I consider to be like family,” Malone said by email. Their shared writing catalog also includes the hits “I Fall Apart,” “Better Now,” “Wow” and “Circles.” “Not only is he one of the best songwriters, but he is a brilliant creative and fashion designer.”
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Walsh went shopping at Dover Street Market, a retail temple in Manhattan where he often goes for inspiration. “I would come here to do massive pulls for The Weeknd,” he said. “I used to start on the top floor and work my way down.”
He still does. As he flipped through racks of Raf Simons and Junya Watanabe on the seventh floor, Walsh recounted this unorthodox rise in the recording and streetwear industries. “Fashion and music are definitely interrelated, but I guess I don’t know too many people who have succeeded in both,” he said. “I stay in the back and don’t need credit.”
Dressed in an all-black “uniform” (T-shirt, Prada nylon shorts, Alyx socks and Nike Air Tuned Max sneakers), with his signature shaved head and chrome-metal grills, he has the tough-guy appearance of a post-apocalyptic British rude boy.
Walsh credits his dexterity to his rough-and-tumble upbringing in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. His father, William, a folk musician who performed at local Irish pubs, encouraged him to write poetry and dance. Walsh was also an obsessive sneaker head. “I drove my mom crazy looking all over the city for the Adidas Equipment Basketball shoes with the interchangeable, different-colored socks,” he said.
Other addictions followed. He started drinking at 11, often getting into after-school brawls until he sobered up a decade later.
At 18, he headed to Los Angeles to study dance at Loyola Marymount University, and he signed with an agent. But dance gigs were few and far between, so he spent most of his 20s as a nightclub promoter, working alongside his brother at Hollywood hot spots such as Emerson Theater and Hyde, where he would party with a young Malone and future designers such as Matthew M. Williams of Givenchy.
In 2011, choreographer Fatima Robinson, whom he met at Eden, a Hollywood nightclub, encouraged him to stop dancing and focus on poetry and design instead. “This woman literally saved my life,” he said.
He quit auditioning and busied himself with writing poetry and daydreaming about streetwear. He looked inside his sneaker closet and began experimenting with Frankenstein combinations. One of the first designs cobbled together was a white Nike Air Force One with a black-rubber creeper sole. “I always wondered what a creeper would look like with certain old sneakers from my childhood,” he said.
He wore his custom sneakers to the clubs, which would get noticed by emerging VIPs such as Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott. In 2014, with seed money from fellow party promoters, he and a friend started a streetwear label called Mr. Completely, which re-imagined classic sneakers including Adidas Sambas and Stan Smiths.
To promote the brand, he held a party at Fourtwofour on Fairfax and invited everyone he knew. Among them was stylist Jahleel Weaver, who ordered several pairs for his client Rihanna. That turned out to be a propitious sale. A few months later, Rihanna invited Walsh to design her debut collection with Puma, which two years later won the Footwear News “Shoe of the Year.”
Sneakers opened other doors. One of them led to Illangelo, a veteran Canadian producer, who became a confidant and his unexpected entree into music writing. Once again, it started at a nightclub. The two were clubbing on the Sunset Strip in 2014 when Illangelo mentioned that he needed a new songwriter. Seizing the moment, Walsh shared a short poem from his iPhone Notes app.
Illangelo was so impressed that he brought Walsh into studio sessions with Alicia Keys, and he ended up getting his first mainstream writing credit on the song “In Common.” Illangelo also introduced Walsh to The Weeknd, who at first was only interested in working with him as a stylist. (The two shared an appreciation for military bomber jackets.) But as Walsh’s reputation as a songwriter began to rise, The Weeknd began bringing him into the studio.
Those sessions resulted in three tracks from the 2016 album “Starboy,” including “True Colors” and “Die for You,” which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 this month, seven years after it was first released, thanks to going viral on TikTok.
Walsh has since gone on to write more than 100 songs for artists as varied as The Kid Laroi (“Without You”), pop powerhouses such as Malone and Lipa, and rock royalty such as Ozzy Osbourne (“Ordinary Man”). His publishing catalog has racked up a combined 20 billion streams. In November, “Sunflower” went 17 times platinum, becoming the highest-certified single of all time.
His soaring music career hasn’t stopped him from other creative pursuits. In 2016, he started Donavan’s Yard, a nightlife collective in Los Angeles with DJs Drew Byrd and Sean G that hosts parties in Tokyo and a streaming concert series on Amazon Music Live. Branded merch is sold at Dover Street Market.
In October, he started a conceptual streetwear label called Iswas with Keith Richardson, his creative partner at Mr. Completely. The label sells one item: a pair of painter’s pants made from Japanese selvage denim that costs $450.
Wearing many hats, Walsh said, affords him creative freedom. “If Abel knows I am winning an award with Dua and doing my own clothing line, he respects that I’m doing OK for myself,” he said, referring to The Weeknd by his given name. “No one feels like you’re too dependent.”
Back at Dover Street Market, Walsh went from floor to floor, examining the clothing racks like an archaeologist at a fresh dig. On the shoe floor, he picked up a pair of cloven-toed “tabi” boots by Martin Margiela. “I appreciate what this guy does,” he said of the designer, who, like himself, shuns the limelight in favor of letting his work speak for itself.
After about two hours, he reached the Rose Bakery, on the ground floor, took a seat and ordered an Earl Grey tea. As ambient music played overhead, he reflected on his unusual journey. “My success comes from artists recognizing that I see the creative process as sacred, somewhat secret,” he said. “I am never the main focus, just as it should be.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

How Much Beauty Is Too Much?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Sometimes the visual meal of men's fashion is richer than any human can reasonably digest.
PARIS -- How is fashion made? Who makes fashion? Adolf Loos put these questions to his readers some time ago -- in 1898, to be exact. In his architecture, the Viennese modernist paired rigorous simplicity with luxe materials and never sniffed at fashionableness, let alone beauty as a value.
It would be nuts to suggest we live in a time as inclined to high-minded aesthetic ideals as that of 19th-century Vienna. Yet we pursue fashion more relentlessly than ever and need beauty more than ever as nature is supplanted by machines. Thus beauty was the yardstick by which to measure a run of men's wear shows here characterized, above all, by its pursuit.
Whatever the runway specifics, designers, as if by secret compact, set their sights on conjuring it this season and none with more assurance than Anthony Vaccarello, who mounted a Saint Laurent show that was theatrical, elegant, blithely unconcerned with lines of gender demarcation and one that neatly answered Loos's question.
From the moment the first model glided onto the stage beneath the rotunda of the Bourse de Commerce -- Pinault Collection, fitted out for the evening with a circular channel-quilted banquette on which guests sat sipping Champagne, there was little question about what fashion may be.
It is attenuated vampire boys in skinny, floor-sweeping coats of velvet or leather and with immense starched bows flaring around their tiny skulls. It is funnel-neck sweaters that envelop half of the wearer's face or cowl-neck silk shirts banded at the waist with cummerbunds wrapped like obis. It is smoking jackets and hooded cloaks and block heels of patent leather that mirrored the models' vinyl-slick hairdos.
Mostly it is atmospheres reminiscent of decadent nights in the upholstered crypt that was Yves Saint Laurent's art-filled Left Bank duplex.
Behavior now is certainly no less decadent than in the '70s heyday of Saint Laurent and his louche cohort. One distinction is that those druggie escapades were intimate and not internet crowdsourced. No one dropped a pin on the orgy. And those in the room, as Mr. Vaccarello is well aware, took care to look every bit as glamorous and sexy in clothes as without them.
The day after the show, Betty Catroux, the Saint Laurent muse, was encountered crossing an avenue near the Hotel des Invalides. "I've just seen the most beautiful thing," said Ms. Catroux, still striking and blond and rail-thin at 78. "The Saint Laurent show. Did you see it? All those tall young dead boys looking just like me."
Paris is a city that has somehow always given people license. Grace Wales Bonner intimated as much after her show, held at the Hotel d'Evreux on the Place Vendôme, luxury's epicenter. In preparing the collection, Ms. Wales Bonner warped the space-time continuum to "constellate" a Paris in which the writer James Baldwin, the showgirl-spy Josephine Baker and the cultivated and epicene Maharaja and Maharani of Indore all overlapped. (Only the Indores were anachronisms; Baker and Baldwin could easily have been in Paris simultaneously.)
When Ms. Wales Bonner talks about introducing an "Afro-Atlantic spirit" to European luxury and about elevating "Black male style," it is sometimes hard to think she does not, in fact, mean the opposite. It is European luxury that could use a jolt of Black male style, in all its variety and dispersion. As usual, Ms. Wales Bonner offered considered and precisely tailored garments in this, her first coed show, notably men's suiting created in collaboration with the Savile Row stalwarts Anderson & Sheppard.
Adding cowrie shells, Berber babouches and obscure intellectual allusions to the mix felt somehow forced. (One collegiate jacket had the words "Sorbonne 56" embroidered on it, a reference to the First Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Paris, where Baldwin famously asserted that there is no unitary Black identity.) As models processed through the various rooms, the musician Hermon Mehari blew notes on a trumpet that only added to the uncomfortable sense of constraint. One of these days, Ms. Wales Bonner may decide to let loose. Kick over the ballroom chairs. Tear down the walls of the gilded salons.
Music always plays a big part in these fashion productions, and Matthew M. Williams at Givenchy opened his show with deceivingly slow stoner sounds by Bakar that stood in stark contrast to an initial grouping of precise black hit man suits tailored by his couture atelier. As more urgent beats kicked in, Mr. Williams ratcheted up the pace and the emotion, sending out a welter of looks layered with elements of workwear, streetwear, normcore and grunge.
Often enough beautiful can be used as a derisory adjective in this context. Yet that's a fine way to describe a Givenchy collection assembled with a spirit that was so stealthy it was almost guerrilla. Stuff designed for the luxury goods market was taken apart and reassembled. Trousers were devised without side seams. A jumpsuit was left open to the waist and draped in back like skirting. Tatty selvage edges and ratted hems belied a level of elevated craft and contributed to the most coherent statement yet by a designer who has more in common with the perfectionist who founded the house than he may let on.
Did the thousands of screaming fans outside this week's shows have any idea that an actual Hubert de Givenchy, let alone Cristóbal Balenciaga or Christian Dior, ever existed? Most were waiting for glimpses of Burna Boy or member of a K-pop group.
Kim Jones knows, though, and at Dior Homme he is fastidious to the point of fixation about keeping alive a dialogue with the house's heritage and, beyond that, our collective cultural past.
Still, do we go to runway shows to hear actors reciting T.S. Eliot's doomy World War I poem "The Waste Land?" We do not. Yet there, projected on screens in a darkened pavilion erected on the Place de la Concorde, were the actors Robert Pattinson and Gwendoline Christie, blown up to colossal size and laying it on thick in a reading of Eliot's poem. It would seem this is Mr. Jones's way of adding gravitas to his place in a lineage that includes not only a design deity like Dior himself but also Yves Saint Laurent.
Mr. Jones has such a surplus of design smarts he doesn't need CliffsNotes references to give heft to presentations that stand on the merits of their own mastery. Few other designers can as confidently take a fisherman's Aran sweater and open the sleeves so they ride on the outside of a wearer's arms; or riff on suit jackets and oilskin raincoats turned into tunics; or add trailing wisps of transparent fabric to suiting or buoyancy batons to the front of a vest. Certainly few designers have done more to turn skirts into an obligatory element of a masculine uniform. And skirts on men were so present on Paris streets this week that they are less a trend than a fact of life.
As at Cannes, where critics are bombarded with new cinematic productions, fashion week sometimes offers up a visual meal richer than any human can reasonably digest. It isn't fair, then, to unravel a spectacle as intellectually knotty as Jonathan Anderson's for Loewe in a few lines. Yet, since that's what space permits, let's just say that by making clothes in wrinkled bookbinder's vellum, beaten copper or pewter, deploying hatter's tricks to pouf out the hems of coats so the wearer resembles a topiary yew, the designer took us into realms previously unseen. He also made a concerning detour to the perimeter of Perv-land when he sent his skinny, hairy, vulnerable looking boy-men parading around in white cotton underpants.
In sharp contrast to all that, Rick Owens's show of relatively modest ("Victorian," he said) cloaks, skirts, straitjacket parkas, paneled shearlings and down-padded jackets was chaste and corrective. Sometimes when viewing one of Mr. Owens's shows, it helps to strip away the Goth styling and "Mad Max" effects. (Isn't it time to retire the fog machine and the spooky contact lenses?) Subtract the gimmicks and what you are left with is uncontroversial clothes that go a long way toward explaining Mr. Owens's booming commercial success.
And that balance is tough to maintain now when you set out to make fashion. On the one hand, there are houses like Louis Vuitton doubling down on social media content with celebrity-studded guest lists and everything including the kitchen-sink onstage. At Vuitton, the Spanish superstar Rosalía sang and rapped from atop a vintage yellow automobile. The paparazzi went crazy for the latest K-pop stars. And the Brooklyn-born designer Colm Dillane, a.k.a. KidSuper, spun up scrappy energy and his trademark cartoon imagery for designs meant to drive logo freaks to the brand's accessories.
Meantime, heritage houses like Hermès rehearse their heritage in an endless loop of tasteful French savoir-faire. (Clutching pearls, Vogue.com noted that the collection featured a "devastatingly gorgeous black cardigan in lamb shearling.")
Even in fashion, too-muchness is a problem. The wonder is not that so many designers go overboard but that so few adhere to the KISS principle. This precept, formalized if not officially developed by the United States Navy in the '60s, held that, in designing systems, simplicity is always the best means to an end.
"Keep it simple, stupid!" is not the worst approach to designing clothes.
And, in fact, among the more memorable shows this week were those that did. At Pierre Mahéo's Officine Générale presentation, the designer riffed at length, in just blue and gray, on a strain of pared down chic people associate with a Paris that, realistically, vanished when Serge Gainsbourg's five-pack a day Gitanes habit sent him to an early grave. Why not revive it, Mr. Mahéo suggested, with clothes for real people of all ages who'd appreciate a chic uniform to be refreshed now and then and worn till the end?
When the models strode out for the finale of the Officine Générale show at the Palais de Tokyo, you immediately hankered to see armies of such types in what used to pass for real life -- pre-Instagram. And when Bianca Saunders presented a collection inspired by her Anglo-Caribbean upbringing in London, shown on a turquoise painted living room set with a corner bar and an easy chair and with an audio background of clips from the Jamaican comedian Oliver Samuels's television show, you could readily imagine those tailored jackets, those dimpled pullover tuxedo coats, those ribbed knit leisure sets worn out on club night in Brixton or Trenchtown.
Rather than straining to force new narratives, the Paris appearance of Emily Adams Bode Aujla brought us another chapter in an ongoing tale forged from the designer's core belief in autobiography. Here the inspiration was Ms. Bode Aujla's maternal family and her mother's summer sojourns working for an aged grande dame on Cape Cod. Fancifully evoking the funky sartorial folkways of a mostly bygone WASP world, she paired Icelandic sweaters with embroidered trousers, plaid pants with shearling vests, tie-dye pullovers with tweed jackets and added spangles everywhere, like a giddy kid pulling granny's frocks from a trunk.
Like Mr. Mahéo and Ms. Saunders, Ms. Bode Aujla found her grounding in the familiar. No mood boards required. Just use what you know.

FLORENCE, Italy — Little-known fact: Dogs are clotheshorses.
In a thriving marketplace for pet apparel that was valued at $5.7 billion in 2021, dog owners account for a majority of sales. Common sense suggests that the bulk of that expenditure goes to leashes, harnesses and collars. Yet as it turns out, T-shirts and sweaters are a startlingly robust canine growth sector. And let’s not forget about coats.
These were some takeaways from Day 1 at Pitti Uomo, the menswear trade fair held in Florence every January and June. And what, one may ask, does Rover’s turtleneck have to do with an event best known for attracting flocks of vain male humans disporting themselves in wackadoodle plumage?
It is that, for the first time, Pitti Uomo devoted a pavilion inside the 16th-century Fortezza da Basso to showcasing animal apparel, and why not? Cats and dogs make up the greater percentage of the hundreds of millions of pets on the planet. And it is largely feline and canine markets that are driving a boom in pet apparel (guppies, parakeets and guinea pigs tending to look better naked).
Among the factors credited with driving market growth are increased urbanization, an overall uptick in disposable income and societal shifts that give pets parity with — and, often enough, priority over — family members. Thus we now see a proliferation of pet-centric brands like Moshiqa, which has been spotted on Lady Gaga’s French bulldogs, as well as Max Bone, PetHaus, Wagwear, Muttropolis, Vanderpump Pets and a raft of other pricey canine offerings from luxury goods houses like Barbour, Ralph Lauren and Gucci.
Surprisingly, it was not the marquee high-end labels — with their $655 logo harnesses (Moncler) or $300 four-legged, fleece-collared blanket-plaid coats (Dsquared2) or $540 patterned woolen hippie ponchos (Alanui), all made in collaboration with Poldo Dog Couture — that brought their wares to Florence.
Instead, for this modest debut, the Pitti pet pavilion was given over to 15 stands in a pavilion designed by architect Ilaria Marelli and featuring mostly plucky indies like the Painter’s Wife from Spain or mid-size brands like Lollipet and DuePuntoOtto (with a line of dot-patterned dog coats and beds designed by Italian architect and design deity Paola Navone), each clamoring to claim a share of what remains a nascent sector.
Was there silliness? Since we are talking about creatures perfectly clad as nature made them, there was. Was considerate design required of garments essentially comprising a top seam, a belt and apertures for head and tail? Oddly, the answer was yes. While one display featured crinolines that would test the dignity of any canine, purebred or mutt, another offered a back-belted doggy car coat inspired by one Hubert de Givenchy created for Audrey Hepburn to wear in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” As did Holly Golightly’s, this one had bracelet-length sleeves.
“It’s huge and it’s growing,” Lollipet designer Sonia Staccioli said of the market for outerwear like the pieces she had brought along, jackets and coats made from metallic fake leatherette, faux fur and a nubby Casentino wool produced for centuries at several small and now imperiled Tuscan mills.
When a reporter inquired of Staccioli, whose Bracco Italiano hunting dog, Ugo, strained at his leash, how making clothes for customers with four legs and little say in their choice of apparel differed from designing for notoriously picky humans, she shrugged.
“It’s basically the same,” she said, “except with dogs you don’t have to listen to their opinion.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.
