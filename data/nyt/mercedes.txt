GROSS SCHÖNEBECK, Germany — Upon learning that Syria’s dynastic dictatorship had fallen, Iman Mohammed, a Syrian refugee living in Germany, felt a surge of elation at the idea that she could return to her homeland.
But that joy quickly faltered as another thought occurred to her: Going back to Syria could mean giving up everything that she and her family had built in Germany since making the dangerous trek to arrive there nearly a decade ago.
“In the cold light of day, when we really looked at everything that had happened, we realized, not just yet,” Mohammed, 41, said of the idea that her family might permanently return to Syria.
The decision may not be hers.
After rebel groups toppled President Bashar Assad’s government on Dec. 8, the prospect of returning home opened for the first time in more than a decade for the many Syrians who fled during the civil war that ravaged the country, including 1.3 million in Germany.
Many of them worked hard and overcame immense challenges to improve their circumstances. Some, like Mohammed, are not keen to give up their new lives.
It is European governments that will have the final word on whether the refugees are allowed to stay.
Within a day of the rebel victory, far-right and even some mainstream politicians in Germany began floating the idea of chartering planes to Syria and giving 1,000 euros (just more than $1,000) to any Syrian refugee willing to return permanently.
Other European countries with Syrian populations have made similar suggestions. Denmark is offering a repatriation package of roughly 20,000 euros to any Syrian refugee willing to go back home and has suggested that it could double that amount to attract more interest. Austria has sent letters to Syrians who have been in the country for less than five years, asking them to detail the reasons they are seeking asylum now that the situation in Syria has changed.
So far, Germany has not taken steps to review the asylum status of Syrian refugees, and the European Union has advised member states against rushing to deport people, stressing that peace in Syria is fragile and that its future is uncertain.
“The situation is still volatile altogether,” Magnus Brunner, the European Union’s migration commissioner, told reporters in Brussels on Dec. 13.
Many Syrian refugees are still apprehensive about the nature of the conversations that have begun so soon after Syria’s civil war ended.
“It is very uncomfortable,” said Sulaiman Abdullah, a journalist who fled Syria more than a decade ago. “We are not some people who just arrived in Germany. We have lived here for 10 to 12 years. We are part of the society.”
Syrians make up one of the largest refugee populations in Germany, and they have become an integral part of the country’s workforce. Many run their own businesses. Some work in the service sector or as drivers, delivery people or in warehouses. Others account for a significant share of the doctors and other medical specialists working in the country, and officials have warned of dire consequences for the strained German health care system if they were all to pick up and leave.
Those Syrians who have learned the language, taken on jobs and made lives for themselves in Germany have felt disappointed in and humiliated by the swiftness of discussions about their status in the country.
“We had not really finished celebrating when the politicians first started talking about our return,” said Anas Modamani, 27, who became the face of the 2015-16 migrant arrivals after taking a selfie with Angela Merkel, the chancellor at the time.
Even before the collapse of the Assad government, Mohammed had spent days in tears, worrying about the visas for her two oldest children. Authorities had refused to recognize their newly printed Syrian passports, needed for them to renew their residency permits.
The problem, one of the many the family has encountered over the years, has not yet been resolved. Mohammed is hopeful that her husband, Baha Mefleh, will soon receive a German passport — he has an appointment to submit his application next year — which would allow the whole family to stay in the country.
Mefleh shares his wife’s nervousness over Germany’s uncertain position on Syrian refugees, but he still holds out hope that one day he can return to his homeland. He would happily trade the family’s home in Gross Schönebeck, a village of 1,400 people about an hour outside Berlin, for the chance to go back to his old life in Daraa, Syria.
When Islamic militants first arrived there, Mefleh was forced to give up his job as a photographer specializing in weddings, leaving behind all of his equipment and a business he had built up over years.
“I would love to go back,” he said, looking sheepishly at his wife. “But, the children.”
They were the reason the family decided to leave. After four years of near misses with bombs, Mohammed decided she did not want to see one of her own among the maimed or dead boys and girls in the streets.
She hopes one day that the family will even be able to buy the two-story duplex in Germany that they now call home, with its wood-burning stove in a cozy living room and a garden in the backyard where they grow cucumbers and zucchini from Syrian seeds.
Their two oldest children have graduated high school and are enrolled in vocational school. One is studying to become an optometrist, the other a hearing aid specialist, with the aim of opening a business together in the area. The younger two, who still have nightmares from the four months they spent crossing southeastern Europe on foot, are in high school.
Although they long to meet the cousins whom they know only through video calls, Syria has become a foreign country for them, and neither of their parents would consider uprooting them once again.
Dr. Hiba Alnayef, an assistant pediatrician in a town 40 miles west of Berlin, said she would also be reluctant to take her young children out of Germany, where they were born, to live in Syria. She wants to stay, despite the hate and discrimination that she says she has faced since arriving in 2016.
“I have experienced racism in my job, from the people around me and even from my neighbors, not all, but some of them,” Alnayef said. She once felt so threatened by a neighbor who was upset that her toddler had touched his Mercedes-Benz that she called police.
She has also fought a surge of guilt, seeing people suffering in Syria and knowing that she has skills that her homeland desperately needs. But for her children’s futures, she is determined to stay in Germany.
In an effort to help her homeland from afar, Alnayef has set up social media pages in Arabic, where she answers questions and offers advice to her 92,000 followers about nutrition, treating minor illnesses or filling out German medical documents.
“Right now, we need to build bridges,” she said. “We need to work together to support the people in Syria.”

Automakers Struggle With Market Shift and Competition From China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Changing technology, political turmoil and competition from China are cutting into profits and forcing carmakers to cut jobs and close factories.
A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in.
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Many car factories around the world are making many fewer cars than they were built to produce. When automakers don't earn a decent return on their factories and machines, there is "a massive effect on profitability," said Simon Croom, a professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego. "The difference between profit and loss is a very fine line in the auto industry."
Workers are among the first to suffer in an industry that employs nine million people worldwide in manufacturing, including around a million in the United States. More than two million more Americans work for dealers and related businesses.
Nissan, which has factories in Mississippi and Tennessee, has not detailed where its layoffs will take place. It is not alone in cutting jobs. Ford last month announced 4,000 job cuts, mostly at factories in Britain and Germany. The company cited "unprecedented competitive, regulatory, and economic headwinds."
Ford was partly referring to Chinese carmakers. Barely a factor before the pandemic, they have charged into the international market with cars that can match Japanese, European or American vehicles on quality, at much lower prices.
BYD, Chery, SAIC and other Chinese carmakers are still effectively barred from the United States by trade rules and hobbled by tariffs in Europe. But they are pushing into places like Australia, Brazil, Chile and Thailand, luring buyers away from the likes of Fiat, General Motors and Toyota.
Competition from China is "starting to hit the safe places that Western carmakers had," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm.
Inside China, the world's largest car market, domestic manufacturers have stolen the limelight from foreign carmakers with over-the-top options like those offered by BYD in its Yangwang U8, a plug-in hybrid off-road vehicle.
The U8 can stay afloat for up to 30 minutes in a flood, according to the company, and its wheels can be set to roll so that the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees while remaining in the same spot.
The rise of Chinese automakers has been particularly tough on German carmakers. Volkswagen gets one-third of its sales from China and once dominated that market. But the company's deliveries there plunged 10 percent in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2023.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also reported big sales declines in China recently, which they blamed for lower profits.
American carmakers have also suffered from this shift. G.M. said this month that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its Chinese operations, which have been losing money.
Companies that were slow to replace aging models are doing worst. That has been the case for Nissan, Stellantis and even Tesla, which analysts expect to end the year with sales that are roughly unchanged from 2023. Others have struggled to build appealing electric vehicles and develop software, an increasingly important element of car design.
Volkswagen was among the first established carmakers to develop electric vehicles, but the models underwhelmed buyers and critics. Sales in the United States of the company's ID.4 sport-utility vehicle plunged by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. Buggy software handicapped sales of the ID.4 and other electric models that Volkswagen sells in Europe and Asia.
"The Chinese are winning market share and the Germans are losing," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany. "It's not only the electric cars, it's the software in the cars."
Changing government policy is adding to the carmakers' woes. Sales of electric vehicles plunged in Germany after the government, facing a budget crisis, abruptly eliminated financial incentives.
In the United States, President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal Biden-era tax credits designed to promote electric vehicles. The shifts in policy endanger the hundreds of billions of dollars that G.M., Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen and others have invested in new factories and cars.
"The auto industry has had to dish out a lot of capital for an underwhelming E.V. market and one that may well change in the next six months," said Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, a research firm.
Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important source of components for virtually all carmakers. Mexico is an important manufacturing center for BMW, G.M., Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen and others, shipping two million vehicles to the United States in the first nine months of the year.
Not all car companies are doing poorly. G.M. shares have risen more than 40 percent this year, while shares of most automakers have fallen. In part, Wall Street is rewarding G.M. for popular electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Equinox. Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief executive, has said the company is close to making a profit on electric vehicles, unlike other American carmakers excluding Tesla.
But G.M. is also retrenching, announcing last week that it would stop developing robotaxis, autonomous vehicles that can carry passengers without drivers. The decision raised questions about whether established carmakers can compete with Tesla and Waymo, a division of Google's parent company, in the next generation of automotive technology.
Toyota's strategy of doubling down on hybrids, while offering few all-electric cars, also appears to be paying off -- at least for now. Many buyers are choosing hybrids, which cost a lot less than electric vehicles and don't need to be charged, as a way to reduce emissions and fuel expenses.
But Toyota could be left behind if sales of electric vehicles grow faster than market analysts expect. Prices for battery-powered vehicles are dropping while the distance they can travel on a charge is growing. In China, electric vehicles are already cheaper than comparable gasoline models. More than half of new cars sold there are electric or plug-in hybrids.
Carmakers are trying to adapt. Stellantis, whose chief executive, Carlos Tavares, quit this month, has new models lined up for 2025. They include several electric vehicles, among them Jeeps, Ram pickups and a Dodge Charger muscle car. The company is also working to repair its relationship with dealers who feel that Stellantis waited too long to lower prices and offer incentives to help them sell cars that were piling up on their lots.
John Elkann, the chairman of Stellantis, held a virtual meeting with U.S. dealers after Mr. Tavares's resignation. Later, the Stellantis National Dealer Council issued a statement expressing optimism that "2025 will mark a turning point."
Attempts to reach Mr. Tavares for comment were unsuccessful.
Market pressures will prompt carmakers to cooperate with one another more, for example, by sharing the costs of engine development, said K. Venkatesh Prasad, the senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"You're seeing some of this already," he said.
Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive, said last month that the company would reduce the time it takes to develop a new vehicle by working more closely with its partners Renault, Mitsubishi and Honda.
Volkswagen is trying to solve its software problems by investing in Rivian, which makes electric pickups and sport utility vehicles in Illinois.
Western carmakers are also making deals with Chinese automakers. Volkswagen will develop new models with Xpeng to sell in China. Last year, Stellantis bought a 20 percent stake in Leapmotor and has begun selling the Chinese company's electric vehicles in Europe.
"If you can't beat 'em," Mr. Dudenhöffer said, "join 'em."

Western carmakers are also making deals with Chinese automakers. Volkswagen will develop new models with Xpeng to sell in China. Last year, Stellantis bought a 20% stake in Leapmotor and has begun selling the Chinese company’s electric vehicles in Europe.
“If you can’t beat ’em,” Dudenhöffer said, “join ’em.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: BYD and other manufacturers are importing cars from China and scouting factory sites in Mexico as part of a global expansion that, for now, excludes the United States.
Behind a crumbling brick wall in a working-class neighborhood of Mexico City lurks a seemingly innocuous car lot. But it could be a sign of a potentially grave threat to the North American auto industry.
A makeshift dealership for the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD has sprung up in this dusty lot. Esteban Alegría, an employee, said the dealership was selling cars as fast as they arrived from China. Mr. Alegría's top seller is the Dolphin Mini, a small but capable four-door electric compact that costs about $ 18,000, about $ 10,000 less than the cheapest battery-powered vehicle available in the United States.
Mr. Alegría's dealership is one of dozens that Chinese carmakers like BYD, Chery, Geely and SAIC are opening up around Mexico as they establish a foothold in North America.
Chinese carmakers are effectively barred from the United States by tariffs that double the sticker price of vehicles imported from China, and they are not yet manufacturing significant numbers of vehicles in Mexico that could be exported across the border.
But their ambition to expand overseas is on vivid display in Mexico and across Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. Ads for Chinese brands are in airports and soccer stadiums and loom above Mexico City streets on large billboards. Chinese cars, both gasoline and electric models, are an increasingly common sight.
BYD and others are also looking for places to build factories in Mexico, although none have announced firm plans. Initially, the plants would serve Latin America, part of a campaign by Chinese automakers to erode the dominance of Japanese, American and European carmakers in places like Brazil and Thailand.
But there is little doubt that, eventually, Chinese carmakers hope to use Mexico as an on-ramp to the United States.
"Maybe next year BYD can enter the United States," Mr. Alegría said optimistically, as salsa music blared from a speaker hung on a pole and two men washed the dust from a newly arrived Dolphin. Nearby, workers mortared a cinder block wall, part of a new building that will replace the one-room sales office made of rough bricks topped by a corrugated metal roof.
"If not," Mr. Alegría added, with a smile, "I can deliver."
It is very unlikely that the Dolphin or any other Chinese car brand will be available in the United States soon. Because of the high tariffs, Chinese carmakers have not tried to establish dealerships or get approval from federal regulators to sell in the United States. (BYD does make electric buses in California.)
And someone buying a BYD from a Mexican dealer like Mr. Alegría would have a hard time registering and insuring it in the United States because the cars have not demonstrated that they meet safety standards.
President Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump have been emphatic about wanting to keep Chinese automakers out of the United States, well aware of the threat they pose to U.S. car and auto parts factories that employ a million workers.
Mr. Trump has threatened 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican products, including cars. Mr. Biden has pursued policies aimed at fending off the challenge from China, including subsidies for U.S. battery factories. The Chinese government has long subsidized carmakers with the goal of becoming a major auto exporter.
But in the years to come it may be difficult to explain to consumers in the United States why they're not allowed to buy inexpensive electric vehicles that are readily available across the border, especially if they're made in Mexico, which already manufactures millions of cars for the United States.
Less than 20 years ago, Chinese cars were widely seen as inferior, even by many Chinese drivers. But in recent years, the country's manufacturers have pulled even with foreign rivals in mechanical quality, analysts say, and often surpass U.S., Japanese and European carmakers in battery technology, autonomous driving and entertainment software. (Think in-car karaoke and rotating touch screens.)
Chinese carmakers have clawed significant market share domestically from once-dominant companies like Volkswagen. Even Tesla, which has a large factory in Shanghai, has lost ground to BYD and other Chinese carmakers. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, will be in a position to influence U.S. auto and China policy after spending more than $ 250 million to support the Trump campaign and becoming a close adviser to the president-elect.
"Before the pandemic, the rules were set down by the Western carmakers," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm. "Now it's the opposite."
Representatives of several Chinese carmakers declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Jorge Vallejo, BYD's director general for Mexico, agreed to an interview but canceled abruptly as New York Times reporters waited outside his office in Mexico City. The company's representative declined to reschedule or make other executives available.
China's car market is the world's largest by far, and the growing prowess of domestic producers is having far-reaching effects. General Motors said on Wednesday that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its operations in China, which have been losing money in recent years.
Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, acknowledged the price pressure from Chinese carmakers during an interview in October. "We'll continue to look at smart ways to take cost out," she said, while insisting that the company could still compete with China.
Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, noted that the industry had dealt with new competitors before, including Japanese carmakers in the 1970s and South Korean carmakers in recent decades. "We think we have a competitive setup," he said in an interview in October.
Still, the auto industry does not appear to have seen anything like the current wave of Chinese brands, which have quickly overtaken Japanese companies as the world's largest auto exporters.
Chinese carmakers have made deep inroads in countries where they have local production or face few significant trade barriers. In Brazil, Chinese brands have a 9 percent share of car sales, up from 1 percent in 2019. In Thailand, they have 18 percent of the market, up from 5 percent in 2019, according to JATO.
In Mexico, Chinese brands now account for 9 percent of new car sales, up from effectively nothing five years ago.
"They gained market share when other brands didn't have inventory and there were long waits to get cars in Mexico," said Guillermo Rosales Zárate, president of the Mexican Association of Automobile Distributors.
In San Luis Potosí, an industrial hub 250 miles north of Mexico City, BYD models are taking customers from Toyota, said Fernando López, manager of a dealership that sells both brands from a showroom in an upscale neighborhood.
BYD's Shark pickup, a $ 45,000 plug-in hybrid, is poaching buyers from the Toyota Tacoma, he said, while the BYD Song, a $ 30,000 plug-in S.U.V., is luring customers from the Toyota RAV4. The Chinese models cost $ 10,000 less than the comparable Toyotas.
"I don't know if people are going to let them sell in the United States," Mr. López said, referring to BYD, "but they can compete with any brand."
Mexico is the world's seventh-largest auto producer, just behind South Korea and Germany. Most major carmakers have factories in Mexico, including G.M., Ford Motor, Stellantis and Volkswagen. Many use parts from Chinese companies like Minghua, which produces bumpers and other components from a plant next to a large BMW factory outside San Luis Potosí.
Almost 80 percent of vehicles produced in Mexico, more than two million through September, went to the United States, according to the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.
Although U.S. tariffs on cars made in China are high, in theory Chinese cars made in Mexico and exported north of the border would currently have to pay a maximum tariff of just 2.5 percent.
But the United States would probably put pressure on the Mexican government to erect barriers to Chinese automakers. Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has played down talk of a BYD factory in Mexico and emphasized that relations with the United States are the government's top priority.
Mexico is "so economically tied to the U.S., at the end of the day this is a straightforward calculation," said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who focuses on international economic relations. In October, the Mexican government raised the tariff on imported cars to 20 percent from 15 percent, in what was widely seen as a reaction to growing sales of Chinese vehicles.
The threat from China will grow as electric vehicles become more popular. Those cars already account for half of all new cars in China, giving the country's carmakers a head start.
Auto executives expect electric vehicles to eventually supplant gasoline and diesel models even if Mr. Trump removes financial incentives for such cars and trucks. G.M., Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and others have staked billions of dollars on electric-car and battery factories.
In Mexico, electric vehicles account for less than 2 percent of new car sales, but have grown more than 40 percent this year despite a dearth of public chargers. Electric vehicles in Mexico City are exempt from restrictions that apply to gasoline and diesel vehicles on days when air pollution is very bad.
That helps the Dolphin Mini, said Daniela Alvarez, a saleswoman at another BYD dealership squeezed into a storefront beneath a Mexico City parking garage.
Ms. Alvarez rattled off the Dolphin's technical specifications, including its advanced battery technology, rotating video display and four airbags. While Chinese electric vehicles still cost more than gasoline models, she said, they cost only 30 percent as much to fuel.
"Electricity is cheaper than gas," she said. "You can make up the difference."

New Chapter for Hamilton As He Departs Mercedes: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He had a remarkable run with the team, winning six titles, but after this weekend he will be racing for Ferrari.
After 12 seasons, 246 Grands Prix, 84 victories and six drivers' championships with Mercedes, the curtain will come down on one of the most storied periods in Formula 1 on Sunday.
Lewis Hamilton bows out of Mercedes, leaving behind a legacy on and off the track. Next year, at 40, he will "fulfill a childhood dream," he said, and drive for Ferrari.
"We've had an absolutely incredible journey together," he said of Mercedes. "We've created history within the sport, and it's something I take a lot of pride in, and I'm very proud of what we've achieved."
On joining Ferrari, Hamilton said he "felt like it was time to start a new chapter" in his career.
"It was not that difficult to convince Lewis" to join, Fred Vasseur, the Ferrari team principal, said. "It is a move that has been 20 years in the making," he added, referring to when Hamilton drove for Vasseur's team in the Formula 3 Euro Series in 2005.
"At the time he was tied to McLaren-Mercedes," Vasseur, said, "but he already had in mind that sooner or later he would go to Ferrari."
Hamilton departs Mercedes as the most successful driver in the team's history, and it will miss him.
"He said he needed change, and I can understand that," Toto Wolff, the team principal, said. "We've been together 12 years, and we've had tremendous success.
"He's the most successful driver. We've had this sensational journey together, and that's something that will go down in the history books, and also in the Mercedes history books."
Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013 after six years with McLaren, where he won his first championship in 2008. Andrew Shovlin, track-side engineering director with Mercedes, said Hamilton "has been a massive part of the growth of the team."
From 2014, following a change in the power-unit regulations, Mercedes dominated. The team won eight consecutive constructors' titles and Hamilton six drivers' championships in seven years. He missed a record eighth in 2021 when he was beaten by Max Verstappen of Red Bull on the final lap of the last race.
"He's achieved such an amount that it all just becomes part of the team's legacy," Shovlin said, in an interview in November. "When he arrived, the first thing you saw was the speed, the determination.
"Over the years, what has been almost endless is his desire and ability to reinvent himself over the winter, to learn from mistakes, to improve, to look for the areas where he would find another gain to beat his competitors. He just kept getting better and better for so long."
Shovlin said Hamilton "has a phobia of losing that drives his work ethic." From a technical perspective, he has "a great ability to drive around problems in the car. Whatever the problem, whatever the conditions, whatever the limitation, he seemed to have a tool for the job."
Ron Meadows, the sporting director with Mercedes, said Hamilton is unique because he "can departmentalize his life."
"When he comes racing, he's fully focused on his racing," Meadows said in an interview in November. "Then you'll see a social media post that he's 12 hours away on a plane somewhere doing something completely different. He's got so much going on in his life, and that's what makes him special.
"When he's at a racetrack, he's all over it. When he's at the factory, he's all over it, but he knows when he can relax, and some drivers can't do that. That's probably the most unique part about him."
When Hamilton doesn't have a great session or makes a mistake, he beats himself up, but "the impressive thing about him is the next morning you wouldn't have known it had happened," Meadows said. "I'd say 100 percent of the time he bounces back really strong."
During his time with Mercedes, Hamilton has built a portfolio of interests, notably music, fashion and film. He has a production company involved in the upcoming movie "F1," starring Brad Pitt. He is also part of the ownership group of the Denver Broncos.
Hamilton has also worked to improve diversity, equity and inclusion inside Mercedes and in motorsport.
In late 2020, Hamilton and Mercedes started Accelerate 25, a five-year program aimed at getting at least 25 percent of all new team employees from underrepresented groups.
The following year, Hamilton and Mercedes formed Ignite, a charitable partnership to increase the representation of people from underrepresented backgrounds in British motorsport. It later merged into Hamilton's Mission 44 charity, which seeks to transform the lives of young people from underserved backgrounds by narrowing opportunity gaps in education and employment.
"When I think about what I leave behind, the thing I am most proud of is the work we've done with diversity," Hamilton said. "We have a very diverse team now."
Hamilton said Wolff and the rest of the team were open to his ideas. "The team put their money where their mouth is and invested."
Hamilton has been assured the effort will continue after he leaves. "When I saw Toto to tell him I was leaving, I said there's going to be no one in the room that's going to have these difficult conversations with you," he said.
"I said to him that I hope he continues with that, and he said he will."
The catalyst for Hamilton was the death of George Floyd in May 2020 at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.
"It brought it to the fore and gave it the urgency and prominence that it had," Bradley Lord, the chief communications officer at Mercedes, said in an interview in November.
"Lewis had spoken to Toto and asked what we could do with the car that was significant, would mark the moment and make a statement. He felt a great weight of responsibility as the sport's only Black driver. He wanted to understand if, and how, Mercedes could stand with him in taking a stand."
After considerable discussion, Mercedes changed its renowned silver livery to black for the 2020 season. It remains black today.
"It was a symbol to our commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive sport and as a categorical statement to end racism, which was a strong statement at the time," Lord said.
"There was a lot of pushback, a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of angry communication to the team, to different subsidiaries of Mercedes-Benz around the globe, people saying they would never buy another car from the brand. To Mercedes' great credit, there was no wavering whatsoever in the face of that."
The implementation of Accelerate 25 has resulted in a change in the demographic and makeup of the team, with more women and more workers from diverse ethnic and national backgrounds.
Hamilton leaves that behind, and it is on to Ferrari. Vasseur, the Ferrari team principal, said in an interview in April that signing Hamilton was "a no-brainer for tons of reasons."
Hamilton has struggled for the last three seasons at Mercedes. He has won only two Grands Prix in that period, both this year.
Vasseur said Hamilton "will add value" and that "he comes to win, not on vacation. I'm convinced we have everything to try."
Hamilton will be scratching a longtime itch. "For every driver growing up, watching the history, watching Michael Schumacher in his prime, I think probably all of us sit in our garage and see the screen pop up, and you see the driver in the red cockpit and you wonder what it would be like to be surrounded by the red," Hamilton said.
"Even as a kid, I used to play as Michael in that car," referring to video games, "so it definitely is a dream, and I'm really excited about it."

E.V. Chargers Finally Pay Off for Retailers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Companies see charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales.
Sarajane Leary knows what to do when her electric car is low on power: She goes grocery shopping.
On a recent afternoon, Ms. Leary plugged her Toyota bZ4X into a fast electric vehicle charger in the parking lot of a Hannaford supermarket in Altamont, N.Y., and then headed into the store for paper goods and potato chips.
"I'll get a 50 percent charge while I'm here," she said.
The time -- and money -- Ms. Leary spends in a store while charging her car is exactly the kind of thing retailers, shopping centers and malls bet on when they started installing E.V. chargers decades ago. For years, their experience was mixed, and the actual benefits were unclear.
Now, new studies say retailers' charging efforts may well be paying off: One peer-reviewed study by researchers at Boston University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison published this year looked at the impact of nearly 1,600 Tesla Supercharger stations in more than 800 U.S. counties and found a 4 percent increase in monthly visits for retailers within 200 meters of chargers after they were installed. The effects were most pronounced for retailers within 150 meters. The researchers also found a 5 percent increase in spending.
Another recent study, published in Nature Communications, analyzed data from California, where E.V. ownership and charging infrastructure are more widespread than in other states. It found that installing chargers brought more modest increases in foot traffic and spending but that public E.V. stations "tend to attract higher-income, exploratory visitors and local residents," and in low-income areas they "enhance businesses."
Some companies -- notably Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States -- are seeing charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales. They have begun building charging stations under their own brand names rather than relying on providers that lease a part of their parking lots to install and maintain the stations.
"Companies are beginning to see charging as something that can potentially help the bottom line," said Graham Evans, a director at S&P Global Mobility, an automotive market research firm. "It's going to become more ubiquitous rather than a token gesture."
The embrace of charging comes as more Americans -- many of whom are worried about a warming planet -- trade in their gas-powered cars. In 2023, 1.4 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in the United States, more than 9 percent of all car sales that year and an increase of over 50 percent from 2022, according to Argonne National Laboratory, a federally funded research center. And although the growth of E.V. sales has slowed this year, an estimated 346,309 of the vehicles were sold in the third quarter, nearly 9 percent of sales, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. (It is too soon to say what impact Donald J. Trump's election will have on sales, but during his campaign he vowed that if he became president he would end the Biden administration's policies that encourage E.V. manufacturing and sales.)
Some of the slowdown in E.V. sales this year can be chalked up to drivers who hesitate to trade in their gas-powered cars because of concerns about E.V. charging infrastructure, which has grown more slowly than E.V. sales. Broken chargers have been a problem: One in five ports does not work when motorists pull up, according to recent research led by a Harvard Business School fellow.
In total, over 200,000 public chargers are spread across about 74,000 stations, but more than a million public chargers will be needed by 2030 to keep up with E.V. sales, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have estimated.
Even with the Biden administration's $ 5 billion plan to fill in the infrastructure gap, a robust national network is still years away. Under that plan, states are required to submit proposals for charging operators and site hosts. Nearly 60 percent of the grants have gone to fuel and convenience stores, rest stops and service plazas, according to EVAdoption, a data and analytics firm. Still, only one in every 14 big-box locations offers charging, while one in every 15 grocery stores and one in every 40 department stores do, a Consumer Reports analysis found.
For many retailers, charging deficiencies present an opportunity: Truckers, ride-hailing drivers and people on long-distance trips rely on public chargers, as do the 5 percent of E.V. owners who are not able to charge at home, many of whom live in apartment buildings and park on the street. The most frequently used public chargers are at retailers, according to a 2024 study of usage data by J.D. Power, a data analytics company.
Some landlords of shopping centers and malls have found that installing chargers on their properties has helped to attract new tenants, said Jim Hurless, a managing director who oversees the E.V. business at the real estate firm CBRE.
But installing the chargers is complicated and expensive. The process involves surveying, engineering, permitting, connecting with local utilities, testing and inspection -- and can take up to 18 months from start to finish. Slower chargers -- considered a good fit for cinemas and hotels, where a customer parks for a few hours or overnight -- can cost up to $ 7,000 to install. Fast chargers, which can provide a significant charge in 20 minutes, can cost as much as $ 175,000.
Many retailers turn the project over to a charging company that pays them a monthly fee for the parking spaces used while retaining any revenue from customers. And those providers have been installing more, and faster, chargers and promising a more reliable, and in some cases plusher, customer experience than in the past.
Mercedes-Benz is investing $ 1 billion on the first phase of a new network of high-speed chargers that can accommodate all brands of vehicles. Its charging stations will have lounges -- and landscaping -- at some locations. The automaker has installed charging hubs at a dozen Buc-ee's gas and convenience stores in the Southeast, with plans to expand to more than 40 additional sites. Starbucks, which had Volvo install 15 stations on properties between Seattle and Denver, will work with Mercedes to add 100 more, including on Interstate 5 on the West Coast.
Some charging companies are developing methods to speed up installations. EVgo has begun to experiment with a prefabricated model, with its first installation at a site in League City, Texas, in March.
But some retailers, like the convenience-store chains 7-Eleven and RaceTrac, are seeking to take control over -- and monetize -- charging by building their own networks.
For several years, Walmart has worked with Electrify America, a division of Volkswagen, and now has Electrify America stations at 280 of the retailer's stores. When Walmart tested its own chargers at stores near its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and in a town near Dallas, it found demand surprisingly strong, said Vishal Kapadia, the company's senior vice president for energy transformation.
"There is a need for this infrastructure in many pockets," he said.
The company is rolling out 15 stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and 10 in Phoenix, and it plans to have thousands across the country by 2030. Walmart expects to spend $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million at each site.
"Charging can be a profitable stand-alone business," Mr. Kapadia said. "The ancillary benefits are driving traffic to our locations."
Even Costco, one of the first retailers to install charging stations in the 1990s, before ripping them out in 2011 because the company said they were rarely used, has recently returned to E.V. charging. Costco installed a station at its store in Ridgefield, Wash., in just seven weeks.
Hannaford, a Northeast grocer with charging stations at 24 of 189 stores -- including the one Ms. Leary frequents -- got into the charging business because it was "how we want to present ourselves," said George Parmenter, health and sustainability lead at Hannaford. "It's a billboard that says, 'This is something important to us."'
Mr. Parmenter said he did not know to what extent charging led to in-store sales, but he noted that a Tesla charging station at a Hannaford store in Portland, Maine, averaged about 2,000 charging sessions a month.
"I don't know what else you could do to get that many people to show up," he added.
Brent Gruber, executive director of E.V. practice at J.D. Power, said: "Fifteen years ago it may have not made the most sense to add charging. Now it makes sense."

For Decades, Installing EV Chargers Didn’t Pay Off for Retailers. Now It Does.

Sarajane Leary knows what to do when her electric car is low on power: She goes grocery shopping.
On a recent afternoon, Leary plugged her Toyota bZ4X into a fast electric vehicle charger in the parking lot of a Hannaford supermarket in Altamont, New York, and then headed into the store for paper goods and potato chips.
“I’ll get a 50% charge while I’m here,” she said.
The time — and money — Leary spends in a store while charging her car is exactly the kind of thing retailers, shopping centers and malls bet on when they started installing EV chargers decades ago. For years, their experience was mixed, and the actual benefits were unclear.
Now, new studies say retailers’ charging efforts may well be paying off: One peer-reviewed study by researchers at Boston University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison published this year looked at the impact of nearly 1,600 Tesla Supercharger stations in more than 800 U.S. counties and found a 4% increase in monthly visits for retailers within 200 meters of chargers after they were installed. The effects were most pronounced for retailers within 150 meters. The researchers also found a 5% increase in spending.
Another recent study, published in Nature Communications, analyzed data from California, where EV ownership and charging infrastructure are more widespread than in other states. It found that installing chargers brought more modest increases in foot traffic and spending but that public EV stations “tend to attract higher-income, exploratory visitors and local residents,” and in low-income areas they “enhance businesses.”
Some companies — notably Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States — are seeing charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales. They have begun building charging stations under their own brand names rather than relying on providers that lease a part of their parking lots to install and maintain the stations.
“Companies are beginning to see charging as something that can potentially help the bottom line,” said Graham Evans, a director at S&P Global Mobility, an automotive market research firm. “It’s going to become more ubiquitous rather than a token gesture.”
The embrace of charging comes as more Americans — many of whom are worried about a warming planet — trade in their gas-powered cars. In 2023, 1.4 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in the United States, more than 9% of all car sales that year and an increase of over 50% from 2022, according to Argonne National Laboratory, a federally funded research center. And although the growth of EV sales has slowed this year, an estimated 346,309 of the vehicles were sold in the third quarter, nearly 9% of sales, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. (It is too soon to say what impact Donald Trump’s election will have on sales, but during his campaign he vowed that if he became president he would end the Biden administration’s policies that encourage EV manufacturing and sales.)
Some of the slowdown in EV sales this year can be chalked up to drivers who hesitate to trade in their gas-powered cars because of concerns about EV charging infrastructure, which has grown more slowly than EV sales. Broken chargers have been a problem: 1 in 5 ports does not work when motorists pull up, according to recent research led by a Harvard Business School fellow.
In total, over 200,000 public chargers are spread across about 74,000 stations, but more than 1 million public chargers will be needed by 2030 to keep up with EV sales, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have estimated.
Even with the Biden administration’s $5 billion plan to fill in the infrastructure gap, a robust national network is still years away. Under that plan, states are required to submit proposals for charging operators and site hosts. Nearly 60% of the grants have gone to fuel and convenience stores, rest stops and service plazas, according to EVAdoption, a data and analytics firm. Still, only 1 in every 14 big-box locations offers charging, while 1 in every 15 grocery stores and 1 in every 40 department stores do, a Consumer Reports analysis found.
For many retailers, charging deficiencies present an opportunity: Truckers, ride-hailing drivers and people on long-distance trips rely on public chargers, as do the 5% of EV owners who are not able to charge at home, many of whom live in apartment buildings and park on the street. The most frequently used public chargers are at retailers, according to a 2024 study of usage data by J.D. Power, a data analytics company.
Some landlords of shopping centers and malls have found that installing chargers on their properties has helped to attract new tenants, said Jim Hurless, a managing director who oversees the EV business at the real estate firm CBRE.
But installing the chargers is complicated and expensive. The process involves surveying, engineering, permitting, connecting with local utilities, testing and inspection — and can take up to 18 months from start to finish. Slower chargers — considered a good fit for cinemas and hotels, where a customer parks for a few hours or overnight — can cost up to $7,000 to install. Fast chargers, which can provide a significant charge in 20 minutes, can cost as much as $175,000.
Many retailers turn the project over to a charging company that pays them a monthly fee for the parking spaces used while retaining any revenue from customers. And those providers have been installing more, and faster, chargers and promising a more reliable, and in some cases plusher, customer experience than in the past.
Mercedes-Benz is investing $1 billion on the first phase of a new network of high-speed chargers that can accommodate all brands of vehicles. Its charging stations will have lounges — and landscaping — at some locations. The automaker has installed charging hubs at a dozen Buc-ee’s gas and convenience stores in the Southeast, with plans to expand to more than 40 additional sites. Starbucks, which had Volvo install 15 stations on properties between Seattle and Denver, will work with Mercedes to add 100 more, including on Interstate 5 on the West Coast.
Some charging companies are developing methods to speed up installations. EVgo has begun to experiment with a prefabricated model, with its first installation at a site in League City, Texas, in March.
But some retailers, like the convenience-store chains 7-Eleven and RaceTrac, are seeking to take control over — and monetize — charging by building their own networks.
For several years, Walmart has worked with Electrify America, a division of Volkswagen, and now has Electrify America stations at 280 of the retailer’s stores. When Walmart tested its own chargers at stores near its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters and in a town near Dallas, it found demand surprisingly strong, said Vishal Kapadia, the company’s senior vice president for energy transformation.
“There is a need for this infrastructure in many pockets,” he said.
The company is rolling out 15 stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and 10 in Phoenix, and it plans to have thousands across the country by 2030. Walmart expects to spend $1 million to $1.5 million at each site.
“Charging can be a profitable stand-alone business,” Kapadia said. “The ancillary benefits are driving traffic to our locations.”
Even Costco, one of the first retailers to install charging stations in the 1990s, before ripping them out in 2011 because the company said they were rarely used, has recently returned to EV charging. Costco installed a station at its store in Ridgefield, Washington, in just seven weeks.

Brent Gruber, executive director of EV practice at J.D. Power, said: “Fifteen years ago it may have not made the most sense to add charging. Now it makes sense.”

Trump Tariffs Would Be 'Two-Alarm Fire' for Automakers and Parts Suppliers: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers and parts suppliers would struggle if President-elect Donald J. Trump followed through on his threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada sent shivers on Tuesday through the auto industry, which depends heavily on both countries for parts and manufacturing.
The prospect of tariffs "is a two-alarm fire for the auto industry," said Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in Michigan. "There is probably not a single assembly plant in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Texas that would not immediately be affected by a 25 percent tariff."
The list of popular vehicles made in Mexico or Canada is long. It includes Ram pickups made by Stellantis in Saltillo, Mexico, and Chrysler minivans built in Windsor, Ontario. General Motors makes Chevrolet Silverado pickups and electric versions of Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s in Mexico, where Ford Motor also makes its Maverick pickup.
All of those vehicles and many others would become significantly more expensive if Mr. Trump, who won Michigan with promises to preserve auto jobs, followed through on his threat, economists said. Those higher auto prices would have a significant effect on overall inflation. And higher car prices would probably lead to lower sales and layoffs at auto factories.
"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation," Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said in an email. Once in office, she said, he will work to bring jobs back to the United States by "raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy."
The prospect of disruptive tariffs hits the industry at a perilous moment. Virtually all automakers are struggling with sagging consumer demand, a growing preference for hybrids and electric cars, and the emergence of Chinese automakers like BYD that are pushing into markets once dominated by Japanese, American and European companies.
Signs of industry woes are proliferating. Nissan, which manufactures several vehicles in Aguascalientes, Mexico, as well as Mississippi and Tennessee, said this month that it would lay off 9,000 employees worldwide because of declining sales. Volkswagen, which has factories in Mexico and Tennessee, is considering closing plants in Europe for the first time in its history.
Sales at Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, fell 27 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which make cars in Mexico and the United States, are earning smaller profits.
Mr. Trump's policy pronouncements have already jolted the industry. The president-elect has vowed to eliminate Biden-era subsidies for electric vehicles, endangering tens of billion of dollars that General Motors and other automakers have invested in U.S. battery factories and new car models.
"The auto industry is in a process of a transformation that is the biggest tech upgrade in history," said Dimitry Anastakis, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies business history. "They are looking for as much stability as possible as they navigate this disruptive landscape. To throw a spanner in the works is not helpful."
Mexican and Canadian factories buy auto parts from the United States and the two countries are major suppliers of components to virtually all U.S. manufacturers including Tesla. That company's chief executive, Elon Musk, was a big supporter of Mr. Trump's campaign and is expected to play a significant role in his administration.
Automakers got a taste of how closely linked they are to Canada in 2022, when groups of truck drivers in that country blocked a bridge linking Windsor to Detroit in protest of pandemic restrictions. Toyota, Ford, Stellantis and others were forced to shut down U.S. assembly lines because of parts shortages even though the protest lasted less than a week.
"Southern Ontario is closer to Detroit auto plants than the supply plants in Indiana, Ohio and Kansas are," said Erik Gordon, a professor of business at the University of Michigan, who follows the auto industry. Tariffs, he said, "would have an effect similar to New York City imposing a tax on food and fuel that comes into the city from New Jersey."
Mr. Trump said tariffs would remain in place until Mexico stopped the flow of illicit drugs and unauthorized immigrants to the United States. But tariffs could lead to an increase in migration if some of the one million Mexicans who work in the auto industry lost their jobs, analysts say.
"As the economy goes, there goes prosperity," said Anna Nagurney, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies supply chains. "It can have spillover effects."
Tariffs could push Mexico closer to China. BYD, SAIC, Geely and other Chinese carmakers have been moving into Mexico, plastering billboards with images of their cars and opening dealerships at a fast clip. BYD and others have been scouting locations in Monterrey and other cities as sites for manufacturing plants.
But plans for factories are on hold while the Chinese wait to see what Mr. Trump will do, Mexican officials have said.
Wall Street was clearly alarmed by the prospect of tariffs. G.M.'s stock closed 9 percent lower on Tuesday after Mr. Trump's statement on tariffs. Stellantis fell about 6 percent, and Ford was down nearly 3 percent.
Ford said its shares suffered less because its operations were more concentrated in the United States than other automakers. "Ford is the most committed to building in America among the major automakers," the company said in a statement.
Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Nissan and Volkswagen declined to answer questions about tariffs, as did the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry's main trade group.
BMW, which has large factories in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and Spartanburg, S.C., declined to comment on Mr. Trump's tariff threat, but said in a statement that free markets are "a key factor not only for our business model, but also for growth, welfare and employment throughout the global economy."
Some auto experts expressed hope that the threat of tariffs was merely a bargaining tool and would never be imposed. The strategy could be effective, some experts conceded.
"People in China and Canada are thinking about concessions they could make before there is even anything on the table," said Richard Baldwin, a professor of economics at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. "He's forcing the Canadians and Mexicans to prenegotiate with themselves."

Judge Scolds Giuliani and Denies Trial Delay After 2 Lawyers Leave Over 'Ethics': [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The subject of several cases, the former New York City mayor lashed out at a judge questioning why he had not forfeited personal assets as required.
Rudolph W. Giuliani was not having a good day, and it showed.
The former New York City mayor was in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday to discuss his continuing failure to give up nearly $ 11 million worth of personal assets. The forfeiture was meant as a down payment on the $ 148 million Mr. Giuliani owes to two Georgia election workers for defaming them by claiming, without evidence, that they had helped to steal the 2020 presidential election.
But first, Judge Lewis Liman allowed Mr. Giuliani's lawyers to withdraw from the case. They had requested to be removed two weeks ago, citing an unspecified "professional ethics" concern.
"I'm sorry it came to this," Kenneth Caruso, one of Mr. Giuliani's lawyers, said before he and his co-counsel left the hearing.
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Caruso said that there had been "a difference of opinion" with Mr. Giuliani but they wished his new counsel "every success."
The focus then shifted to Mr. Giuliani's new lawyer, Joseph M. Cammarata, a former police officer. The men forged a relationship after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when Mr. Cammarata's brother, a firefighter, was killed.
Mr. Cammarata, who has been involved in the case for just over a week, asked that Mr. Giuliani's trial, which is scheduled for Jan. 16, be delayed to determine whether the former mayor could keep his condominium in Florida and several custom-made Yankees World Series rings.
Mr. Cammarata said the delay was necessary because he also had to prepare for a December court appearance in Washington, where Mr. Giuliani could be found in contempt of court for continuing to make false accusations about the two Georgia poll workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss.
Also, Mr. Cammarata said, Mr. Giuliani would like to attend President-elect Donald J. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, and a trial could prevent that.
The answer, Judge Liman said, was no.
The hourlong hearing, punctuated by an angry outburst by Mr. Giuliani, was the most contentious yet in the winding search for his personal assets, which he was ordered to hand over to the two women more than a month ago.
For the first time in weeks, the strain of several cases stemming from Mr. Giuliani's time as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer appeared to be getting to him, as he sat slumped back in his chair with his arms crossed.
After missing several deadlines to surrender the bulk of his assets, Mr. Giuliani has only turned over a fraction of notable items, including some pieces from his luxury watch collection and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz convertible that he says once belonged to the actress Lauren Bacall. But Mr. Giuliani still has not provided the keys or the title to the vehicle.
The former mayor has begun the transfer of his most valuable asset, a 10-room apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side that had been listed for sale at more than $ 6 million. The process has been delayed because the property remains jointly held with his ex-wife, Judith Giuliani.
The scant items that have been surrendered are problematic, according to Judge Liman.
"The car without the keys and title is meaningless," he said, cutting off Mr. Cammarata midsentence.
"Your client is a competent person," the judge added, noting that Mr. Giuliani was a former U.S. attorney. (He was, however, recently disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C.)
Mr. Giuliani objected.
"I have applied for the title," he said of the Mercedes. "I haven't gotten it yet. What am I supposed to do, make it up myself?"
He continued.
"I don't have a car," he said in a raised voice. "I don't have a credit card. I don't have cash." He complained that he didn't "have a penny" that was not tied up by Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss.
Judge Liman warned Mr. Giuliani to let his new lawyer speak for him.
"Somebody has to tell the truth!" Mr. Giuliani shot back.
"Next time, he's not going to be permitted to speak," Judge Liman told Mr. Cammarata. "And the court will have to take action."
The women's lawyers described their frustration in trying to recover Mr. Giuliani's property, much of which is in a storage facility in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., on Long Island.
Aaron Nathan, one of the women's lawyers, said Mr. Giuliani's compliance had been "lackadaisical at best, and intentionally obstructive at worst."
Last week, the women's lawyers said that more than 20 pallets of moving boxes belonging to Mr. Giuliani were still at the storage facility, America First Warehouse, and that the owners were making it difficult to search the contents.
A facility representative, who calls himself "Joe the Box" on social media, posted a defiant video on X in which he expressed support for Mr. Giuliani and said he would not stand for someone to "dissect" the former mayor's life.
Last Friday, Judge Liman ordered Mr. Giuliani to account for all of the property at the facility that was subject to seizure and to deliver it to a warehouse of the women's choosing by Dec. 13.
If Mr. Giuliani continues to miss deadlines in the case, he could face steep penalties, including jail time. There could be similar consequences in Washington, where a judge will decide in December if the former mayor has violated an order not to defame the women by accusing them again of election fraud on recent media appearances.
As he left the courthouse, Mr. Giuliani repeated his grievances at a prepared microphone stand about being targeted for political ends. A heckler shouted at Mr. Giuliani as he walked to a waiting car.
"You got nothing now!" the man said. "You're a bum!"
Mr. Giuliani smiled and turned toward the man.
"I wouldn't bet against me," he said.

Full text: The country is facing a second year of zero growth, with industry leaders gloomy and worried about potential tariffs from President-elect Donald Trump.
As Germans prepare for a snap election after the collapse of a fragile government coalition, one issue at the top of voters' minds will be how the new government would revive the country's once powerful economy at a time when energy prices are high and companies are cutting jobs.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, has not seen significant growth in the past two years. On Friday, the economy recorded 0.1 percent growth from July to September, but it is forecast to contract over the entire year. And economists do not expect to see a return to growth in 2025, unless a new government can make significant changes quickly.
Driving that point home, Germany's largest auto supplier, Bosch, said on Friday that it planned to cut 5,500 jobs, beginning in 2027. More than two-thirds will be at German factories.
High energy prices, a complex bureaucracy, aging public infrastructure and geopolitical developments have hurt Germany's export industry. Political paralysis under the previous government exacerbated the situation.
The three-party coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz spent the last year bickering over issues from energy to immigration before finally collapsing this month. Early elections on Feb. 23 are likely to result in a new government, which will have the opportunity to turn things around.
But economists warn that this will require changes to tax and welfare policies, as well as deregulation and investment in infrastructure. "Without major policy changes, the German economy's long-run growth potential is extremely limited," said Salomon Fiedler, an economist at Berenberg, a private bank.
The Cost of Political Uncertainty
German industrial companies have seen production shrink more than 12 percent since 2018. Many point to a lack of clear signals from Berlin on where they should direct investment.
An example was an abrupt decision by the government to end subsidies for electric vehicles at the end of last year, in an effort to slim down the budget. Automakers, which had been ramping up production of battery-powered cars, saw demand plunge after spooked customers pulled back.
The fallout from that decision has led to enormous job cuts in the automotive industry this year. On Wednesday, Ford Motor announced that it was eliminating 4,000 jobs in Europe, most of them in Germany. Volkswagen is threatening to close up to three of its 10 German factories as part of the restructuring needed to return the brand to profitability.
After losing natural gas from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Mr. Scholz's government quickly pivoted to importing liquefied natural gas, which has kept homes warm and reserves full, but also has resulted in a 40 percent jump in prices from the year before. Nevertheless, the government went ahead with plans to shut down the country's last nuclear reactor.
Analysts point out that such zigzag strategies make it difficult for business leaders to plan investments or predict costs. That frustration has translated into record levels of pessimism among Germany's industrial leaders, according to a survey by the Ifo Institute in Munich.
"There was no clear line from politicians and therefore great uncertainty," said Stefan Sauer, an economic researcher who worked on the report. "That's probably one of the main reasons the mood is so bad and why competitiveness is suffering as a result."
Industry Under Pressure
At the heart of Germany's economic problems lies its once formidable industrial sector, which is expected to see production fall 3 percent in 2024 for the third year in a row, according to data compiled by the German industrial association BDI.
Faced with higher energy prices, environmental and digital services regulation and growing competition from China, companies that once dominated sectors from automotive to machinery and steel now find themselves needing to cut costs and restructure.
"German industry is under massive pressure," said Tanja Gönner, managing director of the BDI. "A recovery in 2025 is not in sight."
This month, Germany's largest steel maker, ThyssenKrupp, was forced to write down the value of its steel division by 1 billion euros, or $ 1.04 billion, after posting a yearly net loss of €1.4 billion, or $ 1.2 billion. The company has been struggling for years to decarbonize its steel production, as the price of powering its existing coking plants has soared.
Beyond the industrial giants, the German economy also depends on innovation and expertise. But in an increasingly digital world, Germany is lacking new start-ups that will help drive the next generation of growth.
Government financing is available to help entrepreneurs start business, but when it comes time to scale them, many move to the United States, where venture funding is more widely available and taxes are lower.
"Our main problem is not what is happening to ThyssenKrupp," Danyal Bayaz, the finance minister for the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, told the German American Conference at Harvard last week. "It is why is the last successful German start-up 50 years old?"
The Looming Threat of Trump Tariffs
Germany, the world's third-largest exporting nation, sells cars, chemicals and machines around the world. But all three sectors are suffering, as geopolitics and supply chain shifts in recent years have disrupted global trade.
Last year, the United States replaced China as Germany's most important trading partner, sending goods worth €157.9 billion, or $ 164.3, across the Atlantic. But with President-elect Donald J. Trump promising across-the-board tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic policies -- including levies of 60 percent or more on goods from China -- that number could drop, further hurting Germany.
Many German companies are already heavily invested in the United States, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and dozens of automotive suppliers, as well as leading chemical and pharmaceutical firms. But those companies also export from their U.S. factories and could be hurt if Mr. Trump's plans set off a wider trade war.
In the last year, German companies invested €15.7 billion, or $ 16.3 billion, in the United States. Cheaper energy prices and lower taxes were the main attraction, but many companies also benefited from the incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Trump has promised to repeal.
During his first term in office, Mr. Trump repeatedly targeted Germany for what he called its "massive trade deficit." Germany's trade surplus with the United States has not shrunk significantly over the last four years, reaching €63.3 billion in 2023, raising concerns that Mr. Trump could again make it an issue.
Regardless of how Mr. Trump's economic policies play out, economists do not expect them to benefit Germany.
"Whether it's the prospects of tariffs or U.S. tax cuts and deregulation indirectly undermining German competitiveness, it's hard to see how U.S. economic policies will not be negative for the German economy," said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING Bank.

Ford to Cut 4,000 Jobs
In Europe by 2027
Ford Motor said Wednesday that it would eliminate 4,000 jobs in Europe as the automaker struggled with slowing demand for electric vehicles and increased competition from Chinese companies.
The company said the jobs cuts, which will take place by the end of 2027, were part of a broader plan to strengthen its business in Europe. The reductions will primarily affect plants in Germany and Britain.
Ford added that it would reduce production of an electric version of its Explorer sport utility vehicle, which would result in shorter working hours at a plant in Cologne, Germany, in 2025.
The company said it was committed to building a thriving business in Europe. "It is critical to take difficult but decisive action to ensure Ford's future competitiveness in Europe," Dave Johnston, Ford's European vice president for transformation and partnerships, said in a statement.
Ford is pulling back as the auto industry tries to navigate the bumpy transition to electric vehicles. The growth rate of E.V. sales has slowed this year in some European countries. Ford has also struggled to sell as many battery-powered models as it had hoped in the United States and said in August that it would reduce the pace of investments in such vehicles.
Other automakers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have also shifted their strategies after reporting fewer sales of battery-powered vehicles than they had expected. GREGORY SCHMIDT
FOOD
Campbell's Deletes Soup
From Corporate Name
Campbell's is ditching the soup -- at least in name. And the change has now received shareholders' greenlight.
Campbell Soup Co. announced its intention to change its name just over two months ago, saying it wanted to instead be known as the (slightly shorter) Campbell's Co. Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the change on Tuesday.
In a statement, CEO Mark Clouse maintained that this "subtle yet important change" will retain the company's iconic name "while reflecting the full breadth of our portfolio."
New Jersey-based Campbell's hasn't been exclusive to the soup business for some time. The company also owns brands like Prego sauce and Goldfish crackers -- and completed a $ 2.7 billion acquisition of Sovos Brands, the maker of Rao's pasta sauces, earlier this year.
Still, the 155-year-old food seller is most famous for its namesake canned soups, adorned with red and white labels. Its new name won't change that, the company says -- noting the Campbell's soup brand or packaging will not be affected.
"We love soup and always will," Clouse stated Tuesday. "The iconic red and white Campbell's soup labels that consumers love will be on shelves forever."
Campbell's is far from the first to attempt such as makeover. From Dunkin' to KFC, other food companies have rebranded themselves -- often shedding the mention of a specific item they were known for with a shorter corporate title, or even an updated logo -- in hopes of emphasizing other business.

Full text: Jes Fan
Through Dec. 20. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com.
This is Jes Fan's first solo gallery exhibition in New York, but he is a known quantity. I first encountered the Canadian-born, Hong Kong-raised artist's biomorphic, bio-curious sculptures in a gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 2019, and his wall-penetrating sculptures were in the recent Whitney Biennial. They stay with you, tapping into the uncanny aspects of the human body and the way it overlaps with other organic matter. Few artists are doing this as successfully; one of them, Tishan Hsu, has been creating evocative, body-boundary-warping sculpture since the 1980s.
In the front room at Kreps, a rectangular vat is filled with soy milk, into which is projected a video featuring a "homemade endoscopy" (!) -- which means a tiny camera Fan either ingested or stuck somewhere else. (The gallery assistants weren't clear about which orifice served as a point of entry.)
The exhibit continues through some clammy, cream-colored latex curtains, in a space filled with curvy resin wall sculptures that resemble botanical cross-sections, and armatures covered with bio resin (a plant-based thermoplastic) draped with silky sheets of soy skin.
The power of this work rides on its ambiguity. Should I be engrossed or grossed out? That is the nature of organic matter, of course: It can be desirable and alluring or repulsive, and Fan's most compelling pieces vacillate between these two poles.
Les Levine
Through Jan. 25, 2025. Ulrik, 175 Canal Street, Manhattan; 734-757-5201, ulrik.nyc.
If you're worried that the art market is ruining art, head over to Ulrik and watch Les Levine's brilliant video "Analyze Lovers: The Story of Vincent" (1990), about how the art market was ruining art in the 1980s. (Or, for a deeper art history dive, read Giorgio Vasari's laments about successful 16th-century Italian artists living lavish lifestyles.) Turns out it's an eternal concern: the fear that money can eclipse creativity and the magic of art.
Levine's 45-minute interview-style video soars because of its all-star (for the art world) cast. The critic John Perrault plays a deadpan van Gogh. Julian Schnabel, the painter who made a film about another art market juggernaut -- Jean-Michel Basquiat -- is here. So are the painter Malcolm Morley, the gallery owners Richard Feigen and Jeffrey Deitch, the art critics Thomas McEvilley and Grace Glueck, an economist and even a Catholic monsignor and Buddhist monks who weigh in on the spiritual aspects of art megastardom and commercialization.
Ultimately, in the often wild art marketplace, a $ 50 million van Gogh can be both a "crime" (the art critic's opinion) and a convenient place to park a lot of money (the economist's read). What's fascinating here is how van Gogh himself is portrayed: messiah or pauper sponging off his brother Theo or post-Kirk-Douglas-Hollywood-kitsch character (Douglas played him in the 1956 film "Lust for Life"). Levine's video never decides, and the case of the Dutch master remains as generative as his extreme-impasto brushstrokes.
Sara Cwynar
Through Dec. 21. 52 Walker, 52 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-1961, 52walker.com.
Lush, layered and immersive, Sara Cwynar's show "Baby Blue Benzo" at 52 Walker is a dazzling journey through photography, showing how the medium creates desire for products -- and, ultimately, for more photographs. This isn't the first time Cwynar has grappled with consumer desire; she once made a video about the rose gold iPhone. Here the focus is the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, which in 2022 sold at auction for about $ 143 million, the highest auction price to date for a car.
In a 21-mintue video also titled "Baby Blue Benzo" and a series of related photo works, Cywnar takes us through the moves a photographer makes when creating her images: researching, collating, collaging, streaming, panning, touching, clicking, tracking. She stands both behind the camera and in front of it, intermittently directing and performing.
Pamela Anderson, a modern master of the image -- like Marilyn Monroe or Princess Diana -- makes an appearance, serving as a kind of doppelgänger for Cwynar, who is also blond and Canadian-born. Anderson and the show as a whole force viewers to consider some of the more vexing questions in contemporary culture: What is the difference between consuming a product and an image? How does photography turn people into products? How is it like a drug (the punning benzodiazepine of the title)?
The end of the video delivers a surprise. It involves a high-camp, retro-style performance by ice skaters in red racecar-driver costumes. Cwynar appears among them, skating with more than average proficiency, gliding into an impressive sit spin. This unexpected demonstration of mastery seems harmless at first until you realize its hidden message: Those who control the production of images have extraordinary skills and resources that they use to entertain and seduce us, both into the universe of technical images and into the economies, politics and ideologies that are programmed into it.

Americans Are Leaving Benefits on the Table: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People get just 70 percent of their full Social Security benefit if they claim at 62, the full benefit at 67 and 124 percent of the benefit if they claim at 70. The gain from waiting is so big that it pays for most people to keep working,or even to dip deep into their retirement savings early to cover their expenses so they can delay claiming.
A 2022 study found that "virtually all" American workers then in the 45-to-62-year-old age group should wait beyond age 65 to start collecting Social Security checks. It said that more than 90 percent should wait till age 70, yet only 10 percent appeared to do so. Many started collecting checks on the first date they were eligible, once they turned 62.
To put it bluntly, people are making expensive choices. "The median loss for this age group in the present value of household lifetime discretionary spending is $ 182,370," the researchers found. For that amount of money, you could almost buy a Mercedes AMG-S63. Or, alternatively, pay a few medical bills. (The math for delaying benefits isn't quite as favorable now as it was in 2022, when that "virtually all" study came out, because of a rise in the interest rate that goes into the calculation.)
I'm interested in two things. One is why people make this choice when it is so often a mistake. The other is why our system makes it so easy for them to make this mistake. I feel about premature claiming the same as I feel about state-run lotteries, which prey on the desperate and the dreamers. I don't claim early and I don't buy lottery tickets. The mistakes other people make indirectly benefit me by decreasing payments and thus my tax burden, and that seems unfair.
A caveat: Delaying claiming isn't right for everyone. If you are in poor health or have other reason to think you'll die young, grab the government's money while you can. Likewise if you fear you'll have to declare bankruptcy unless the checks start coming. A report last year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that about 40 percent of people in their early 60s reported a disabling condition and that about 40 percent of recent retirees reported being forced out of work. For some such people, claiming Social Security early may be unavoidable.
That said, many other retirees can wait but don't. Suzanne Shu of Cornell has done deep research on the psychology of early claiming. She told me that a lot of people, when surveyed in their 50s, said they planned to claim late, understanding that the monthly benefit is higher for late claimers. But as age 62 approached, they crumbled.
"It's a bit like having a chocolate chip cookie in front of you on the table," she said.
The people who are most likely to crumble are those who perceive the benefit as a kind of possession, as opposed to a government benefit that's paid mostly out of the payroll taxes on current workers, she and John Payne of Duke found in a paper last year.
"Social Security is a program that most American workers think they already have as an endowment. They want it as soon as they can get their hands on it," she said.
People with a high degree of loss aversion are also likely to claim early, Shu and Payne found. That's counterintuitive, because by claiming early and getting smaller checks, they lock in a lifetime loss. But that's not how the early claimers see things, Shu, who has a doctorate in behavioral science, told me.
People who are loss-averse feel the pain of a loss more acutely than they feel the pleasure of an equal or even bigger gain. A highly loss-averse person frets about losing benefits by postponing claiming and then dying earlier than expected. That potential loss looms larger for the person than the more likely outcome of bigger checks over a normal life span.
Nudges to get people to claim later can cause them to claim even earlier, previous research found. For example, telling people how many years they need to live to do better by delaying claiming may cause many to fixate on the risk of an early demise. Graphing the benefits of delaying claiming doesn't help either, another study found.
In a journal article last year, Shu and three other researchers tested 13 interventions. The ones that worked got people to focus on behavioral norms, the possibility of feeling regret in the future from claiming too early, the benefits to one's future self from claiming later and the risk of living long and therefore needing the biggest checks possible.
I salute Shu and her fellow academics for trying to help. But the problem they're trying to solve would be smaller if the Social Security formula was changed to make it truly actuarially fair -- that is, with a reduced penalty for claiming early and a smaller benefit for claiming late. Rising longevity spoiled the original formula because the bigger checks from delaying started lasting longer when people started living longer, making a delay in claiming ever more attractive.
In a statement to me for this newsletter, a Social Security Administration spokesperson wrote that the terms "were enacted by Congress in 1983" based on expectations for longevity and interest rates and can be changed only by another act of Congress.
One possibility is to drop the concept of actuarial fairness and focus instead on income adequacy. A 2014 study published by the Social Security Administration found that one small tweak -- namely, increasing the financial advantage of delaying claiming by one year, from 62 to 63 -- could make a meaningful difference in people's behavior. More than that could be done.
If you've read this far, there's a good chance you're one of those people thinking of delaying claiming Social Security benefits past your full retirement age or have already done so. Congratulations. But spare a thought for people your age who didn't or couldn't wait.
Elsewhere: Warren Buffett Has a Lot of Cash
Check your wallet. Count your coins. Look at your checking account. If the cash adds up to less than $ 325 billion, then you have less than Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had at the end of September. A lot of the latest increase in cash and equivalents (mostly Treasury bills, actually) came from selling shares in Apple, which is still the company's biggest stock holding. Buffett said this year that it made sense to sell and pay capital gains taxes now because the tax rate is likely to rise. He's also not seeing any great ways to spend cash on stocks, including those of Berkshire itself. A warning for the rest of us, perhaps.
Quote of the Day
"The historian must retell, with a new richness, the story of what some one of the worlds of the past was, how it ceased to be what it was, how it faded and blended into new configurations, how at every stage what was, was the product of what had been and developed into what no one could have anticipated. All of this to help us understand how we came to be the way we are and to extend the poor reach of our own immediate experience."
-- Bernard Bailyn, presidential address at the American Historical Association annual meeting (Dec. 28-30, 1981)

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He pulled dump trucks, flipped cars and tossed five-pound bricks as if they were Kleenex boxes. Tending to parakeets brought out his gentler side.
Geoff Capes, a herculean wonder from the English countryside who, in addition to winning the World's Strongest Man competition twice, was a champion breeder of parakeets, an activity that provided an escape from stunts like bending steel bars around his neck, died on Oct. 23 in Lincoln, England, in the East Midlands. He was 75.
The death, at a hospital, was confirmed by his son, Lewis Capes, who did not specify a cause.
At 6-foot-6 and 365 pounds, Mr. Capes was a crushing Adonis whose daily diet consisted of seven pints of milk, two loaves of bread, a dozen eggs, two steaks, a jar of baked beans, two tins of sardines, a pound of butter and a leg of lamb.
His gargantuan caloric intake powered his extraordinary feats in strongman competitions: pulling 12-ton trucks uphill, flipping cars, tearing London phone books in half and tossing five-pound bricks as if they were Kleenex boxes. He could run 200 meters -- nearly the length of two American football fields -- in under 25 seconds.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"When you saw him sprint, you realized just what an absolutely terrifying athlete he was, as in terrifyingly good," Colin Bryce, a television commentator for the World's Strongest Man competition, said in an interview. "He wasn't just a big lump."
Mr. Capes won the World's Strongest Man title in 1983 and 1985. He won the U.K. Truck-Pulling Championship in 1986. And he was a six-time champion of the World Highland Games, a competition of traditional Scottish sports during which participants wear kilts while throwing heavy objects, including telegraph poles.
His physical prowess made him a favorite of Queen Elizabeth II, who howled in laughter after her glove stuck to his sweaty, sticky hands when she congratulated him on winning the Braemar Games, another Scottish skills competition, in 1982. Prince Charles and Princess Diana stood nearby having a giggle.
For many years, Mr. Capes was England's most famous athlete. Television news reporters marveled at his diet and his muscular triumphs, including his simple method for changing flat tires -- lifting the car with one hand while putting the spare on with the other.
Mr. Capes appeared in numerous commercials, including one for the Volkswagen Polo, in which he flips over the tiny car to examine its underbelly as a voice-over says, "You don't have to be the richest or strongest man in the world to pick up a Polo."
Children played a simulated version of him in the computer game "Geoff Capes Strong Man." And in the 1980s he was a familiar sight on Christmas Day, when the World's Strongest Man competition aired on television after the queen's address to the nation.
"I don't think you can stress quite how much fame Geoff had because you couldn't ever recreate it in the modern era," Mr. Bryce said. "Unless you were in America, where you were like an N.F.L. star and you became a true household name. Geoff was a true household name in Britain."
Mr. Capes got his start in competitive sports as a shot putter. He won 17 national titles and was the European indoor champion in 1974 and 1976. He competed in three Olympics (1972, 1976 and 1980), finishing as high as fifth place in 1980.
He supported himself and his young family by working as a police officer. One afternoon, he was sent to arrest a man for not paying a fine. He knocked on his door. When the man opened it, Mr. Capes saw dozens of budgerigars -- a type of parakeet -- chirping about in cages.
"Could I have a look at your birds?" Mr. Capes said.
They brought back memories of his childhood, when he tended to injured birds and animals. The man invited him inside and served him a cup of tea. They had a lovely chat about the tiny, chatty budgies. Mr. Capes even held some of them in his giant hands.
Alas, after an hour, Mr. Capes reminded the man that he was there to arrest him.
"He came quietly and afterwards we kept in touch," Mr. Capes told The Sunday People, a London newspaper, in 1998. "Two weeks later he gave me my first ever pair of breeding budgies."
Mr. Capes began breeding them with the same enthusiasm with which he trained for strongman competitions. He competed in budgerigar shows throughout Europe, winning a world championship in 1995. He was named president of the Budgerigar Society in 2008 and frequently judged competitions.
"There's something about their color and beauty that fascinates me," Mr. Capes told The Sunday People. "They bring out my gentler side."
Geoffrey Lewis Capes weighed 12 pounds, 7 ounces when he was born on Aug. 23, 1949, in Holbeach, an agricultural town in Lincolnshire, England. His father, Bill Capes, was a land worker. His mother, Eileen (Alcock) Capes, was a matron at a care home who stood six feet tall and weighed 250 pounds.
"The family wasn't just working class," Mr. Capes was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph, "but was on the lowest rung of that very long ladder that is the English class system."
Growing up, he recalled, he was "always in fights."
"If the next town came down on a Friday and there were only eight or nine of them, I'd say, 'Go back and get some more,"' he told The Daily Telegraph in 2023. "I'd fight them on my own. I was quite quiet but there was an inner aggression."
He left school at 14 and became a laborer, hauling sacks of potatoes and picking up other odd jobs. He also joined a local athletic club, where he met Stuart Storey, a hurdler who would later compete in the 1968 Olympics.
"I was a problem child with challenging behavior, and he rescued me from this, put me straight and guided me through the early days," Mr. Capes told the British magazine Athletics Weekly in 2015.
Mr. Storey encouraged him to throw the shot put and enter competitions. Unable to afford decent clothing, Mr. Capes traveled to events wearing garments that his mother's patients left behind when they died.
He joined the local police department in 1969 and served as a patrol officer for two years before switching to a position teaching calisthenics to new recruits.
Mr. Capes's marriage in 1970 to Gillian Fox ended in divorce. He married Kashmiro Bhatti in 2018. She survives him. In addition to his son, he is also survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Emma Capes, and six grandchildren.
At the height of his breeding career, Mr. Capes owned more than 300 budgies. He had built them a small wooden aviary behind his home and cooked for them every morning.
"It's my own special recipe consisting of boiled eggs, mashed carrots and a few other secret ingredients that I'm not prepared to divulge," he told The Sunday People. "I mash it all up into a sort of porridge."
The birds devoured it.
"It gives them everything they need," he said, "for shiny plumage, healthy bones and strong beaks."

Giuliani's Delay in Handing Over His Prized Assets Angers Judge: [National Desk]

Full text: A federal judge threatened Rudolph W. Giuliani with a contempt charge after a missed deadline to hand over prized possessions, including Yankees swag.
A federal judge on Thursday, having grown exasperated with Rudy Giuliani, said he had heard enough excuses.
"What can be delivered right now?" Judge Lewis J. Liman asked, after peppering lawyers for Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, with questions about some of his most prized possessions, among them a signed Joe DiMaggio jersey; 26 designer watches; and a vintage Mercedes-Benz.
Those items, and more, were supposed to be handed over last week to begin paying off a $ 148 million judgment to two former Georgia election workers whom Mr. Giuliani had defamed. The deadline came and went, and still nothing was turned over.
On Thursday, the judge set the latest "final" deadline, brushing aside repeated arguments that the possessions should remain with Mr. Giuliani while the case was under appeal. By the end of next week, he said, Mr. Giuliani had to either hand over all the items, or he could face civil contempt, a charge that could carry severe penalties, including possible jail time.
The testy exchange was the latest twist in a wild-goose chase that has sent the plaintiffs' lawyers searching for assets at a luxury co-op on the Upper East Side, a condo in Palm Beach and a remote storage unit in Ronkonkoma, a hamlet on Long Island two hours outside of Manhattan.
Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, the former election workers, sued Mr. Giuliani for defamation in 2021, after he claimed, without evidence and on several occasions, that they had tried to steal the presidential election four years ago from Donald Trump. The women, who are Black, faced racist smears and death threats.
Late last year, a jury awarded them $ 148 million for the harm they suffered. Faced with mounting debts, Mr. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, but, because he refused to comply with basic court requirements, the case was dismissed, leaving his assets vulnerable to his many creditors.
The most valuable item is Mr. Giuliani's longtime home, a 10th-floor apartment near the top of a white-glove cooperative building at 45 East 66th Street in Manhattan. It was last listed in October for $ 5,175,000, down from an original price of $ 6.5 million.
Lawyers discovered that Mr. Giuliani had failed to update paperwork in connection with the apartment after his divorce from his wife, Judith Giuliani, stalling the transfer.
Mr. Giuliani, who entered the courtroom in Lower Manhattan on Thursday in a pair of thick-rimmed sunglasses, a navy suit and a red-white-and-blue tie, shook his head and grimaced throughout the hourlong hearing, occasionally fiddling with a large ring. It was unclear if the ring was part of the assets to be surrendered.
His lawyer argued that forcing his client to surrender a watch given to him by his grandfather was "vindictive."
"Oh, come on, that's ridiculous," the judge said, his voice rising. "Bodega owners have family heirlooms," he said, referring to another case he has presided over -- "and if they have a debt, they have to pay the debt."
He added, "The law is the law."
On Halloween, when the lawyers for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss were granted access to the apartment, they said they discovered that Mr. Giuliani's most valuable items -- luxury furniture, art and Yankees collectibles -- had been moved weeks earlier.
At the hearing, Kenneth Caruso, a lawyer for Mr. Giuliani, confirmed that many of the items had been put into storage in the Long Island facility, but he could not specify exactly which ones. Other items, including several watches and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz convertible, are at or near Mr. Giuliani's Palm Beach condo, he said.
Mr. Giuliani has claimed that he doesn't recall what is in storage, and efforts to get a full inventory from the Long Island facility owner have not been successful, the lawyers said.
"We've asked over and over where the stuff is," Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the two women, said.
"The notion that your client doesn't have any knowledge of where his assets are located is farcical," Judge Liman said, addressing Mr. Giuliani's lawyers.
Mr. Caruso charged that the plaintiffs were seeking an inventory of items only to "entrap" Mr. Giuliani into making false statements.
Mr. Giuliani has claimed that the Mercedes-Benz convertible was once owned by Lauren Bacall, the Hollywood starlet. On Election Day, in Palm Beach, Mr. Giuliani was seen cruising in the passenger seat of a car that matched its description.
Even though the vehicle had already been included in the list of assets to be surrendered, Mr. Giuliani's lawyers argued that it was exempt because it was worth less than $ 4,000. But the vehicle regularly sells for $ 15,000 or more on the open market, according to car experts.
Other items could also be at risk of seizure. Mr. Giuliani is arguing that his Palm Beach condo should not be subject to the order, because of a state exemption. Mr. Giuliani's son, Andrew, has said that a collection of World Series Yankees rings made for his father should not be included, because they were given to him some years ago.
Lawyers for the two women also raised the question of a recently discovered limited-liability company that Mr. Giuliani appears to have a stake in. Mr. Caruso quipped that a bank account with about $ 3,000 was also being pursued.
"It's real money to me," Judge Liman shot back.
Mr. Caruso vowed to appeal the defamation case decision to the Washington, D.C., circuit court.
As Mr. Giuliani left the courthouse, he struck a defiant tone, denying that he had defamed the women.
"The reality is that this case is obviously a political vendetta," he said, before insisting that he will cooperate with the new deadline.
Before ducking into the back seat of a gray Lincoln S.U.V., he made a rueful allusion to Mr. Trump's election win.
"Mr. Trump doesn't have to help me get out of it," he said. "All Mr. Trump has to do is straighten out the legal system. Then you'll find out who the real criminals are."

Full text: While touring the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston, Jamaica, on a Saturday in late September, Shenseea, the dancehall pop singer, paused at a glass case. Inside was the Grammy lifetime achievement award that Mr. Marley received posthumously in 2001.
"Haffi get one," she said in Jamaican Patois of her desire to win a Grammy of her own.
Shenseea, 28, who was wearing a cropped turquoise halter top, a matching flowy skirt and Louis Vuitton slides, has already come closer than many. In 2022, she was up for album of the year for her work as a collaborator on Ye's album "Donda."
The museum occupies Mr. Marley's former home in the Jamaican capital, where Shenseea also has a residence. Though she was raised mostly in Kingston and grew up listening to Mr. Marley's reggae music, she had never been to the museum before.
"He made it so cool to be a rasta," Shenseea said, referring to Mr. Marley's association with the Jamaican spiritual movement Rastafarianism. She had left the museum and was sitting in the back seat of a white Mercedes-Benz, playing a string of breezy new songs she has yet to release. Mr. Marley, Shenseea continued, "showed the people that it's OK to live your life the way you want to, even though it's different."
The same could be said for Shenseea. Dancehall, a musical genre known for its suggestive lyrics and provocative visual style, was not a feature of her upbringing in a Christian household. "I wasn't allowed to listen to dancehall music when I was young," Shenseea said. "When I was in high school, that's when I fell in love with it."
She is now among the brightest young stars of the genre, which blossomed in the 1970s in Kingston and is named for the dance halls that held parties in the city.
Her music is sexy and playful, and she sings assertively in smooth Patois and English about the pursuit of female pleasure on songs like "Foreplay," "Lick," "Work Me Out," "Good Comfort" and "Hit & Run."
As an artist, Shenseea has a goal of "empowering women, getting them confident," she said, adding that "the focus should be bettering yourself," not on seeking external validation. "If it's not there, don't rush it," she said. "Wait. Work on other things, like yourself. It's OK. Go party, go do something, go outside, touch grass."
After gaining recognition for her fiery delivery on the 2017 single "Loodi," Shenseea, who uses a stage name (she was born Chinsea Lee), signed with Interscope Records in 2019. She has since made two albums; the second, "Never Gets Late Here," was released in May. Later this month, she is planning to begin a North American tour with the R&B singer Jhené Aiko.
Her visit to the Bob Marley Museum came just after she had finished headlining another North American tour promoting her sophomore album. Shenseea, who lives mostly in Miami with her 9-year-old son when she is not traveling, was in Jamaica for a festival held in celebration of her birthday.
Over the years, the sound of her music has evolved from what she described as strictly dancehall to a version that incorporates elements of other genres like R&B, pop, hip-hop and Afrobeats. "Putting music and genres together -- it creates so much magic," she said.
Her appearance has also changed. Shenseea, whose mother is Jamaican and whose father is Korean, said her early looks involved a lot of colorful wigs, a common element of dancehall style. "I was changing wigs like crazy," she said. "Pink, blue, green, yellow."
These days, she often wears her hair in long locs that fall below her waist. She said her wardrobe -- which includes mesh bodysuits, form-fitting dresses and other garments with cutouts or crystal embellishments -- blended dancehall dress codes with her personal style, which she described as "very feminine" and "Black."
Lately, she has been wearing a mix of brands: Theophilio, by the Jamaican designer Edvin Thompson, along with Marine Serre, Jean Paul Gaultier and Pucci. Many of her outfits are heavily accessorized with bracelets, bangles, rings and earrings. Damaris Flores, a stylist in Los Angeles who works with Shenseea, said her preference for colorful, sleek attire with "island vibes" reflected the "very fun, electric" sound of her music.
Shenseea's look also nods to the tradition of pioneering female dancehall artists like Lady Saw, Sister Nancy and Patra using their image and music to challenge cultural norms in the 1980s and '90s. "It's OK to be raunchy in dancehall because it is the culture," Shenseea said. "But as I'm growing, I'm more subtle with it."
For many female dancehall artists, "dress is ultimately about sexiness," said Carolyn Cooper, the author of "Sound Clash: Jamaican Dancehall Culture at Large," because "the capacity to attract the gaze is empowering."
"That person who attracts the gaze is the one who has the power, not the person who is gazing," added Dr. Cooper, an emerita professor of literary and cultural studies at the University of the West Indies.
When Shenseea took the stage at the Shenseea Birthday Festival, held the day before she visited the Bob Marley Museum, she wore a strapless red Norma Kamali minidress with ruching on the sides. In front of about 5,000 people, she performed a late-night set that had many in the crowd singing along -- even to her newest single, "Dating Szn," which she had released only a week before the event.
In "Dating Szn," she sings about seeing two men at once as a way of weighing her options. After the festival, Shenseea described the song as reflective of her approach to dating. "I'm not going to rush into a situation without knowing what it is or who it is," she said.
The event was organized by Romeich Major, a manager who discovered Shenseea. It took place at Plantation Cove, a sprawling outdoor venue in St. Ann Parish where dancehall stars like Sean Paul, Beenie Man and Buju Banton have played concerts of their own.
"They say when you learn how to perform in Jamaica, you can perform anywhere," said Shenseea, who tends to bring fans onstage to dance with her. "You have to engage with the audience."
As partygoers entered the venue, they walked through a giant cutout of a dragon, a creature featured in Shenseea's album art and in a tattoo on her forearm. In the hours leading up to her performance, a lineup of D.J.s played dancehall classics to pump up the crowd as Shenseea watched from a cordoned-off area, occasionally taking puffs from a hookah pipe.
Although it was organized as a one-off event, the festival had a high turnout and Shenseea hoped that it could happen again. "I feel like now, especially since I went overseas, more eyes are looking down on Jamaica," she said. "They're flying down. They want to get to know the culture again -- they're getting excited."
Shannon Shaw, a 26-year-old nurse who attended the festival in a pleated miniskirt, said Shenseea encouraged her female fans "to believe in themselves, always be themselves."
"Nuh depend pon nuh man, be an independent gyal," Ms. Shaw continued in Patois.
Marie Seaton, a 51-year-old sales consultant who attended the festival in a sparkly black mesh bodysuit, also characterized Shenseea as a girl's girl.
"She's stylish, she's sexy, she's vibrant," Ms. Seaton said. "She makes me feel free."

KINGSTON, Jamaica — While touring the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston, Jamaica, on a Saturday in late September, Shenseea, the dancehall pop singer, paused at a glass case. Inside was the Grammy lifetime achievement award that Marley received posthumously in 2001.
“Haffi get one,” she said in Jamaican Patois of her desire to win a Grammy of her own.
Shenseea, 28, who was wearing a cropped turquoise halter top, a matching flowy skirt and Louis Vuitton slides, has already come closer than many. In 2022, she was up for album of the year for her work as a collaborator on Ye’s album “Donda.”
The museum occupies Marley’s former home in the Jamaican capital, where Shenseea also has a residence. Though she was raised mostly in Kingston and grew up listening to Marley’s reggae music, she had never been to the museum before.
“He made it so cool to be a rasta,” Shenseea said, referring to Marley’s association with the Jamaican spiritual movement Rastafarianism. She had left the museum and was sitting in the back seat of a white Mercedes-Benz, playing a string of breezy new songs she has yet to release. Marley, Shenseea continued, “showed the people that it’s OK to live your life the way you want to, even though it’s different.”
The same could be said for Shenseea. Dancehall, a musical genre known for its suggestive lyrics and provocative visual style, was not a feature of her upbringing in a Christian household. “I wasn’t allowed to listen to dancehall music when I was young,” Shenseea said. “When I was in high school, that’s when I fell in love with it.”
She is now among the brightest young stars of the genre, which blossomed in the 1970s in Kingston and is named for the dance halls that held parties in the city.
Her music is sexy and playful, and she sings assertively in smooth Patois and English about the pursuit of female pleasure on songs like “Foreplay,” “Lick,” “Work Me Out,” “Good Comfort” and “Hit & Run.”
As an artist, Shenseea has a goal of “empowering women, getting them confident,” she said, adding that “the focus should be bettering yourself,” not on seeking external validation. “If it’s not there, don’t rush it,” she said. “Wait. Work on other things, like yourself. It’s OK. Go party, go do something, go outside, touch grass.”
After gaining recognition for her fiery delivery on the 2017 single “Loodi,” Shenseea, who uses a stage name (she was born Chinsea Lee), signed with Interscope Records in 2019. She has since made two albums; the second, “Never Gets Late Here,” was released in May. Later this month, she is planning to begin a North American tour with R&B singer Jhené Aiko.
Her visit to the Bob Marley Museum came just after she had finished headlining another North American tour promoting her sophomore album. Shenseea, who lives mostly in Miami with her 9-year-old son when she is not traveling, was in Jamaica for a festival held in celebration of her birthday.
Over the years, the sound of her music has evolved from what she described as strictly dancehall to a version that incorporates elements of other genres like R&B, pop, hip-hop and Afrobeats. “Putting music and genres together — it creates so much magic,” she said.
Her appearance has also changed. Shenseea, whose mother is Jamaican and whose father is Korean, said her early looks involved a lot of colorful wigs, a common element of dancehall style. “I was changing wigs like crazy,” she said. “Pink, blue, green, yellow.”
These days, she often wears her hair in long locs that fall below her waist. She said her wardrobe — which includes mesh bodysuits, form-fitting dresses and other garments with cutouts or crystal embellishments — blended dancehall dress codes with her personal style, which she described as “very feminine” and “Black.”
Lately, she has been wearing a mix of brands: Theophilio, by Jamaican designer Edvin Thompson, along with Marine Serre, Jean Paul Gaultier and Pucci. Many of her outfits are heavily accessorized with bracelets, bangles, rings and earrings. Damaris Flores, a stylist in Los Angeles who works with Shenseea, said her preference for colorful, sleek attire with “island vibes” reflected the “very fun, electric” sound of her music.
Shenseea’s look also nods to the tradition of pioneering female dancehall artists like Lady Saw, Sister Nancy and Patra using their image and music to challenge cultural norms in the 1980s and ’90s. “It’s OK to be raunchy in dancehall because it is the culture,” Shenseea said. “But as I’m growing, I’m more subtle with it.”
For many female dancehall artists, “dress is ultimately about sexiness,” said Carolyn Cooper, the author of “Sound Clash: Jamaican Dancehall Culture at Large,” because “the capacity to attract the gaze is empowering.”
“That person who attracts the gaze is the one who has the power, not the person who is gazing,” added Cooper, an emerita professor of literary and cultural studies at the University of the West Indies.
When Shenseea took the stage at the Shenseea Birthday Festival, held the day before she visited the Bob Marley Museum, she wore a strapless red Norma Kamali minidress with ruching on the sides. In front of about 5,000 people, she performed a late-night set that had many in the crowd singing along — even to her newest single, “Dating Szn,” which she had released only a week before the event.
In “Dating Szn,” she sings about seeing two men at once as a way of weighing her options. After the festival, Shenseea described the song as reflective of her approach to dating. “I’m not going to rush into a situation without knowing what it is or who it is,” she said.
The event was organized by Romeich Major, a manager who discovered Shenseea. It took place at Plantation Cove, a sprawling outdoor venue in St. Ann Parish where dancehall stars like Sean Paul, Beenie Man and Buju Banton have played concerts of their own.
“They say when you learn how to perform in Jamaica, you can perform anywhere,” said Shenseea, who tends to bring fans onstage to dance with her. “You have to engage with the audience.”
As partygoers entered the venue, they walked through a giant cutout of a dragon, a creature featured in Shenseea’s album art and in a tattoo on her forearm. In the hours leading up to her performance, a lineup of DJs played dancehall classics to pump up the crowd as Shenseea watched from a cordoned-off area, occasionally taking puffs from a hookah pipe.
Although it was organized as a one-off event, the festival had a high turnout and Shenseea hoped that it could happen again. “I feel like now, especially since I went overseas, more eyes are looking down on Jamaica,” she said. “They’re flying down. They want to get to know the culture again — they’re getting excited.”
Shannon Shaw, a 26-year-old nurse who attended the festival in a pleated miniskirt, said Shenseea encouraged her female fans “to believe in themselves, always be themselves.”
“Nuh depend pon nuh man, be an independent gyal,” Shaw continued in Patois.
Marie Seaton, a 51-year-old sales consultant who attended the festival in a sparkly black mesh bodysuit, also characterized Shenseea as a girl’s girl.
“She’s stylish, she’s sexy, she’s vibrant,” Seaton said. “She makes me feel free.”

Giuliani Moved Possessions From His Apartment as Creditors Closed In: [National Desk]

Full text: Lawyers for the two election workers seeking to collect on a $ 148 million defamation judgment against Rudolph W. Giuliani found that he had largely cleared out his Upper East Side home.
On the morning of Halloween last week, lawyers for two former Georgia election workers walked into Rudolph W. Giuliani's Upper East Side apartment. They were there to get an estimate on what it would cost to move the former mayor's belongings. Not much, it turned out.
Mr. Giuliani had taken his most valuable possessions elsewhere, further delaying an effort by the two workers to collect on the $ 148 million judgment imposed on him for defaming them after the 2020 election. The apartment, at 45 East 66th Street, is Mr. Giuliani's single biggest asset. He tried to sell it last year for $ 6.5 million. But it is just one of a catalog of his possessions that a court ordered him to turn over to the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, by last week.
When the lawyers walked into the 10th-floor apartment last week, they found rugs, a dining table, a few small pieces of furniture and inexpensive wall art, they told the judge overseeing the case in a filing on Monday night.
Gone were the art, furniture and sports memorabilia designated to go to the women in compensation for Mr. Giuliani having falsely portrayed them as seeking to cheat Donald J. Trump as they counted the ballots in Georgia four years ago.
That wasn't all.
The lawyers found that Mr. Giuliani had failed to sort out the paperwork necessary to transfer ownership of the apartment to Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss. And other possessions of Mr. Giuliani's that he has been ordered to surrender, including his vintage Mercedes-Benz convertible and his collection of expensive watches, had also been moved, apparently to Florida, where he has a condo.
On Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani was seen pulling up to a polling place in Florida in a convertible that his spokesman Ted Goodman said belonged to Mr. Giuliani.
In response to Mr. Giuliani's delays in turning over his assets by the previously imposed deadline of Oct. 29, Judge Lewis J. Liman of Federal District Court in Manhattan scheduled an in-person hearing for Thursday and is requiring that Mr. Giuliani be present. Mr. Giuliani's lawyers asked the judge on Tuesday to allow Mr. Giuliani to call in to the hearing because, they said, he was scheduled to appear on live broadcasts on Thursday and Friday. The judge denied the request.
The lawyers for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss said they had learned that Mr. Giuliani had moved most of his possessions out of the Manhattan apartment four weeks before they got access to it.
Mr. Goodman said in an email that Mr. Giuliani has made his assets and possessions available to the women, with the exception of a few that are in storage. He said the lawyers for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss were "attempting to bully and intimidate Mayor Giuliani until he is rendered penniless and homeless."
While it is not very common, there are instances when a defendant does not cooperate with court orders, said Kathleen S. McLeroy, a lawyer with Carlton Fields who specializes in these issues.
"There are people that think that they can continue to do whatever they want to do," Ms. McLeroy said. "And unfortunately, a creditor has to be somewhat patient."
In December, a federal jury in Washington, D.C., determined Mr. Giuliani owed the women $ 148 million for the damage he did to their reputations when he falsely accused Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss of ballot fraud while they were counting votes in the hotly contested Fulton County, Ga., around this time four years ago.
At the time, Mr. Giuliani was working as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer and was helping to lead the effort to overturn the election.
On Dec. 3, 2020, Mr. Giuliani and the Trump campaign released an edited video of grainy footage of people counting ballots. The people were Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss. Mr. Giuliani posted the video on social media, where it was circulated for millions to see. He said they had hidden illegal ballots in suitcases.
A day later, everything changed, Ms. Moss testified last December.
Ms. Moss and Ms. Freeman, who are Black, started receiving violent, racist threats against them.
One of the messages read, "Be glad it's 2020 and not 1920."
"I was afraid for my life," Ms. Moss testified. "I literally felt like someone is going to come and attempt to hang me, and there is nothing that anyone will be able to do about it."
Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss first sued Mr. Giuliani for defamation in December 2021.
For months, Mr. Giuliani routinely ignored court orders regarding his finances and his businesses. He was so unresponsive that the judge overseeing the case in Federal District Court in Washington ruled that Mr. Giuliani was liable for defaming the women, sending the case to a jury to decide the amount he should pay.
After the jury determined he owed Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss $ 148 million, Mr. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, which protected him from his creditors immediately seizing his assets. But he was similarly uncooperative during the bankruptcy process, leading the federal bankruptcy judge to dismiss his case some eight months later.
Mr. Giuliani faces additional lawsuits and criminal charges in two states. A former employee is also suing him for sexual harassment. He has lost his law license in New York and Washington, D.C., because of his efforts to help Mr. Trump overthrow the 2020 election results.

There Are Ways to Keep Autocrats Out of Power. Why Don't We Use Them?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Democratic self-rule contains a paradox. It is a system premised on openness and competition. Any ambitious party or politician should have a shot at running for office and winning. But what if a major candidate seeks to dismantle that very system?
America confronts this problem today. Donald Trump poses a clear threat to American democracy. He was the first president in U.S. history to refuse to accept defeat, and he illegally attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Now, on the brink of returning to the White House, Mr. Trump is forthrightly telling Americans that if he wins, he plans to bend, if not break, our democracy.
Mr. Trump tells us he plans to prosecute his political rivals, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney and other members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee; deploy the army to repress protest; and order the deportation of 15 million to 20 million people, including some legal immigrants.
We have been studying democratic crisis and authoritarianism for 30 years. Between the two of us, we have written five books on those subjects. We can think of few major national candidates for office in any democracy since World War II who have been this openly authoritarian.
The view that Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to democracy is shared by Gen. Mark Milley, his onetime chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called him "fascist to the core," and by his former chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, who described him as a fascist who prefers dictatorship to democracy.
How could such an openly authoritarian figure have a coin flip's chance of returning to the presidency? Why have so many of our democracy's defenses seemingly broken down, and which, if any, remain?
We spent the last year researching how democracies can protect themselves from authoritarian threats from within. We have found five strategies that pro-democratic forces around the world have employed. None offer foolproof protection (no democracy could enjoy foolproof protection and remain a democracy), and some of them come with important drawbacks. But our research suggests that in the face of imminent extremist threats, these strategies are the best available.
The traditional American response to extremism is laissez-faire which makes it almost odd to call it a strategy. We rely on the self-correcting power of electoral competition. The belief is that all opinions should compete freely, allowing the marketplace of ideas, or what John Stuart Mill called "the collision of adverse opinions," to play out. If we let all candidates compete, the thinking goes, good ideas and candidates will ultimately beat out the bad ones.
Electoral competition is, of course, essential to democracy. But a laissez-faire approach has two important limitations. First, in the United States, competition is distorted by an 18th-century institution, the Electoral College, that allows election losers to win power. In one sense, the electoral marketplace worked in 2016 the way it is theoretically supposed to: More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Mr. Trump. But the Electoral College permitted an authoritarian figure who won fewer votes to become president.
In addition, history shows us that electoral competition alone is insufficient to fend off extremist threats. Good ideas don't always win out. And candidates seeking to subvert democracy don't always lose. In the past quarter-century alone, leaders like Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Kais Saied in Tunisia and Nayib Bukele in El Salvador have won decisive electoral majorities -- and then used their elected offices to undermine fair competition, making it nearly impossible to remove them from office democratically.
Yet democracies are not helpless. There are four other strategies for fending off authoritarian threats from within. One of these is a far more muscular approach, known as militant or defensive democracy. Born in West Germany as a response to Europe's democratic failures in the 1930s, the militant democracy approach empowers public authorities to wield the rule of law against antidemocratic forces. Haunted by the experience of Hitler's rise to power via the ballot box, West German constitutional designers created legal and administrative procedures that allowed the state to restrict and even outlaw "anti-constitutional" speech, groups and parties. In the 1950s, these tools were used to ban both a Nazi successor party and the Communist Party. Today, German authorities are investigating the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.
Obviously, there are significant drawbacks and risks to empowering public officials to bar candidates or parties from elections. Candidate disqualification distorts electoral competition and restricts voter choice. Worse, the tools of militant democracy are easily abused by politicians seeking to sideline their rivals, as has occurred with some frequency in Latin America.
Nevertheless, most contemporary democracies employ elements of militant democracy. In South Korea, the Constitutional Court banned the Unified Progressive Party in 2014 because it deemed the party's pro-North Korean views to be antidemocratic. In Brazil, the Supreme Electoral Court has the authority to bar politicians convicted of corruption and other crimes from running for office, and a 2021 democracy protection law made it a crime -- punishable by up to 12 years in prison -- to attempt to overthrow a democratic government. Last year a former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who, like Mr. Trump, tried to discredit and then overturn an election, was barred from public office for eight years.
The United States has a tool on the books for disqualifying anti-constitutional candidates: Section III of the 14th Amendment disallows former public officials who have "engaged in insurrection or rebellion" from holding office. Intended to bar Confederate leaders from public office, Section III might have been used to disqualify Mr. Trump from the ballot -- as Colorado's Supreme Court ruled in late 2023 with regard to its state's primary ballot. Earlier this year, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, barring congressional legislation, the 14th Amendment could not be used to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot. With that decision, for good or ill, America chose to forgo the path of militant democracy.
A third approach to defending democracy is partisan gatekeeping. In the absence of legal tools to block extremist threats, the responsibility for fending off such threats falls to political parties. In a healthy democracy, party leaders police their own ranks, expelling antidemocratic elements or refusing to nominate extremists or demagogues for public office.
American parties were effective gatekeepers throughout the 20th century. In the early 1920s, Henry Ford, the plain-spoken founder of Ford Motor Company, who was admired by many Americans but whose extremism and antisemitism were embraced by Hitler and the Nazis, considered running for president as a Democrat. Early polls showed him leading the pack of potential candidates. But Democratic leaders never seriously considered him. Finding the party's gates closed, Ford abandoned his presidential aspirations.
Half a century ago, Republican leaders engaged in self-policing when they joined in congressional investigations into wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon. When Mr. Nixon's abuse of power was brought to light, key Republican leaders supported impeachment. Their actions shifted public opinion in important ways. It was not until a group of Republican lawmakers came out in favor of impeachment beginning in late July 1974 that a clear majority of Americans supported Mr. Nixon's removal from office.
Today's Republican leaders have abandoned gatekeeping. Even after Mr. Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election, they protected and supported him. Had Senate Republicans voted to convict and disqualify Mr. Trump after his second impeachment, he would not be a candidate today. But they did not. And now, nearly all Republican officeholders support Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, despite having witnessed, firsthand, his assault on democracy and the rule of law. Captive to an authoritarian outsider whom they should have kept out, Republican leaders now imperil, rather than defend, democracy.
When authoritarians make it onto the ballot, prodemocratic forces may turn to a fourth strategy: containment, in which politicians from across the ideological spectrum forge a broad coalition to isolate and defeat the authoritarians. Building a multiparty coalition requires that politicians temporarily set aside many of their short-term ambitions and policy goals. Such sacrifice is arguably in their long-term interest, because without democratic institutions, politicians' ability to pursue their short-term ambitions and policy goals will be undermined.
Opposition parties engaged in successful containment last year in Poland. When the illiberal Law and Justice Party government sought a third term, Poland's fragmented and ideologically diverse opposition united to defeat it. The center-right Civic Platform of the former prime minister Donald Tusk built an alliance with former Communists, greens, the conservative Peasant Party and a party led by Szymon Holownia, a television personality and presidential aspirant, to confront Law and Justice in the October 2023 parliamentary elections. The parties negotiated unified tickets -- to avoid splitting the vote -- for Senate races and, after jointly capturing a majority of seats in the election, elected a new government, putting an end to nearly a decade of democratic backsliding.
On several occasions, French parties have contained illiberal forces by forging what they call a cordon sanitaire -- a multiparty electoral coalition aimed at isolating and defeating far-right extremists. That strategy proved strikingly successful in July, when Marine Le Pen's radical right National Rally stood poised to become the largest force in Parliament after the first round of legislative elections.
In the face of an imminent far-right victory, party leaders and activists from across the spectrum, including the communists, greens, socialists, centrists and center-right Republicans, worked together, district by district, to persuade allied candidates to stand down and back a single candidacy against Ms. Le Pen's forces. Notwithstanding considerable acrimony among the parties, the strategy succeeded: The united "republican front" relegated the National Rally to third place.
In the United States, some Republican politicians have embraced a containment strategy. In a textbook example, the former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both Republicans, cooperated with Democrats on the House Jan. 6 Committee. Ms. Cheney, Mr. Kinzinger, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and a handful of other prominent Republicans took the important step of supporting Kamala Harris for president, making it clear that the threat posed by Mr. Trump outweighed any partisan loyalties or policy preferences.
But containment is hard in a polarized two-party system. Most of the prominent Republicans who have not endorsed Mr. Trump, including Senator Mitt Romney, former Vice President Mike Pence, and former President George W. Bush, declined to back Ms. Harris, opting instead to remain on the sidelines. Other leading Republicans who declared Mr. Trump unfit for office after 2020, such as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, who ran against Mr. Trump this year, now support him. As long as Republican leaders who privately view Mr. Trump as a grave danger refuse to go public, most Republican voters will remain unmoved.
That leaves a fifth strategy: societal mobilization. Democracy's last bastion of defense is civil society. When the constitutional order is under threat, influential groups and societal leaders -- chief executives, religious leaders, labor leaders and prominent retired public officials -- must speak out, reminding citizens of the red lines that democratic societies must never cross. And when politicians cross those red lines, society's most prominent voices must publicly and forcefully repudiate them.
A recent example of societal mobilization is the German public reaction to the revelation of a secret November 2023 gathering in which leaders of the far-right AfD met with neo-Nazi groups and discussed a plan for the mass deportation of immigrants, including foreign-born German citizens.
When the meeting came to light, the chairmen of the boards of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche joined top labor union leaders to condemn extremism and publicly express support for democracy, diversity and tolerance. At the same time, a network of small businesses started the Business for Democracy initiative and published a statement, signed by more than 300 business leaders, defending democracy and declaring that "human dignity is inviolable." Later, the chief executive of Siemens publicly repudiated AfD policies and declared it was time to "stand up and intervene."
The Catholic Church also responded forcefully. Representatives from all 27 German bishoprics released a statement condemning right-wing nationalism and declaring:
Right-wing extremist parties and those that place themselves close to such ideologies can be no place of political engagement for Christians. These parties are not electable. ... We call on all fellow citizens ... to clearly reject political offers from the far right.
Those public declarations took place against the backdrop of the largest street demonstrations in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The demonstrations were organized by a civil society coalition called "Hand in Hand," which encompassed 1,300 different organizations, including unions, churches, doctors' associations, refugee protection agencies and even environmental groups. Millions of citizens from across the political spectrum gathered week after week in large cities and small towns in defense of democracy. Although the AfD remains very popular in several eastern German states, its national support has declined by approximately 25 percent since the protest movement began.
When President Bolsonaro began to threaten democratic institutions in the run-up to the 2022 election, Brazilian civil society mobilized in a similar manner. Mr. Bolsonaro threatened the Supreme Court, attacked the legitimacy of the electoral system, and sought to dismantle Brazil's electronic voting system. This spurred business, religious and civic groups to mobilize, which produced a series of high-profile public letters in defense of democracy. In July 2022, the University of São Paulo Law School organized a letter in defense of democracy, which declared:
We know how to put aside minor differences in ... defense of the democratic order ... Regardless of individual electoral or partisan preferences, we call on Brazilians to remain vigilant in defending democracy and respecting election outcomes. In today's Brazil there is no room for authoritarian backsliding.
The letter was signed by former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, nine retired Supreme Court justices, and the heads of many of Brazil's largest banks and businesses. As one Brazilian political scientist put it, the letter "put the issue of democracy on the election agenda."
The following month, Brazil's leading business association, the São Paulo Federation of Industries, spearheaded a statement, signed by the country's Federation of Banks, its Chamber of Commerce and Academy of Sciences, the São Paulo bar association and more than 100 other organizations that defended democracy as "essential" to Brazil's future and affirmed an "unwavering commitment to the institutions and fundamental principles of the Rule of Law."
Finally, in October 2022, as Brazil headed into a second-round runoff between Mr. Bolsonaro and ex-President Lula da Silva, Catholic bishops from across Brazil published a "Letter to the People of God," which called on Catholics to reject Mr. Bolsonaro. The letter declared that "staying neutral is not an option when it comes to choosing between two visions for Brazil -- one democratic and the other authoritarian .... The Church does not have a political party, nor will it ever, but it does take a stand."
Mr. Bolsonaro narrowly lost the runoff, and his effort to overturn the election results met overwhelming public rejection.
In the United States, the civic response to the Trump threat has been tepid. For a moment, business leaders seemed poised to defend democracy. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, many leading U.S. businesses announced that they would not contribute to lawmakers who voted to decertify the results of the 2020 election.
Unfortunately, most of these companies -- including AT&T, Boeing, Comcast, G.E., General Motors, Home Depot, Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, UPS, Verizon and Walmart -- soon abandoned their pledge. Politico identified more than 100 companies and business groups that pledged to suspend or review donations to election deniers in early 2021. More than 70 of them resumed contributions to election deniers before the 2022 midterms. Overall, ProPublica found that at least 276 Fortune 500 companies have contributed to congressional election deniers.
As the 2024 election approached, many American chief executives publicly downplayed the threat posed by Mr. Trump. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, declared that "America is going to be fine ... no matter what happens in this election," while Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said his company would "survive and thrive" under either party's candidate. Mr. Dimon, who is considered influential in financial circles, has privately supported Ms. Harris but publicly declared himself undecided in the election's final weeks.
Although many individual business leaders have worked to defend democracy, leading national business associations like the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce remain on the sidelines, refusing to repudiate Mr. Trump's authoritarianism.
Many of America's religious leaders have also remained quiet. Most prominent evangelical leaders have either remained silent or endorsed Mr. Trump. To give one example, although Franklin Graham claimed to be above the partisan fray, he called on his followers to "Pray for former President Donald Trump. His enemies want to do everything they can to destroy him."
Catholic leaders have also failed to speak out. Although the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a public statement condemning the Jan. 6 insurrection, it was, in the words of the Catholic writer Thomas Reese, "remarkably silent" in the face of Mr. Trump's subsequent resurgence. In November 2023, the bishops conference issued an election-year document entitled "Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship," as it does every four years. The letter listed abortion as a "pre-eminent priority," but it did not mention the defense of democracy. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was sharply critical of the first Trump administration's immigration policies, but unlike the German bishops' response to the AfD's mass deportation plans, it has not publicly denounced Mr. Trump's own mass deportation plans.
The U.S. establishment is sleepwalking toward a crisis. An openly antidemocratic figure stands at least a 50-50 chance of winning the presidency. The Supreme Court and the Republican Party have abdicated their gatekeeping responsibilities, and too many of America's most influential political, business and religious leaders remain on the sidelines. Unable to rise above fear or narrow ambition, they hedge their bets. But time is running out.
What are they waiting for?

Skewering Men Sparks Backlash in China: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Comedy has become a way for women to skewer China's gender inequality. Some men aren't happy about it.
On the list of topics best avoided by China's comedians, some are obvious. Politics. The Chinese military.
Now add: Men's fragile egos.
That, at least, was the message sent this month, when a major e-commerce platform abruptly ended a partnership with China's most prominent female stand-up comic. The company was caving to pressure from men on social media who described the comedian, Yang Li, as a man-hating witch.
Speaking up for women's rights is increasingly sensitive in China, and the stand-up stage is the latest battleground. Growing numbers of women like Ms. Yang are speaking out about -- and laughing at -- the injustices they face. On two hugely popular stand-up shows this fall, women were among the breakout stars, thanks to punchlines about the difficulty of finding a good partner, or men's fear of talking about menstruation.
But a backlash has emerged, as men balk at being the butt of the joke. They have attacked the comics on social media; Ms. Yang has described receiving threats of violence. The women's new visibility can also be easily erased. Not long after the e-commerce company, JD.com, dropped Ms. Yang, it deleted posts on its official social media account featuring two other female comedians.
The battle over women's jokes reflects the broader paradox of feminism in China. On the one hand, feminist rhetoric is more widespread than ever before, with once-niche discussions of gender inequality now aired openly. But the forces trying to suppress that rhetoric are also growing, encouraged by a government that has led its own crusade against feminist activism and pushed women toward traditional roles.
On guancha.cn, a nationalistic commentary site, an editorial declared: "The fewer divisive symbols like Yang Li, the better."
Even before the JD.com controversy erupted, Ms. Yang, 32, had addressed the perils of poking fun at men. On one of the recent shows, she said young female comics had asked her whether they should make certain jokes.
"I didn't have an answer," Ms. Yang said. "If I told them to do it, I'd worry what would happen to them afterward. If I told them not to, I'd worry about how good their performances would be."
Ms. Yang, who declined an interview through a representative, was one of the first Chinese comedians to demonstrate the possibilities for women in stand-up.
The daughter of pig farmers in Hebei Province, Ms. Yang was a former graphic designer and aspiring comedian when she shot to fame in 2020, with a routine about her dating woes. "How can men look so average, and yet be so confident?" she said, a one-liner that went viral.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
To many women, she became an icon. But many men viciously denounced her, accusing her of inciting "gender antagonism" -- a term state media often uses to denounce feminism -- and even reporting her to the government. When Intel and Mercedes-Benz featured her in ad campaigns in 2021, online fury prompted Intel to drop her and Mercedes-Benz to limit the ad's visibility.
Ms. Yang was unapologetic. And gradually, more women joined her. A female contestant on one of this year's shows thanked Ms. Yang, who was the show's chief screenwriter, for acting as an "older sister" in a male-dominated field.
Those women have been blazing their own trails, with jokes that sometimes go further than Ms. Yang's or broach new aspects of women's daily indignities. Several performers talked about men commenting on their weight, or their parents' preferences for sons. Another contestant, named Cai Cai, told a story about ordering menstrual pads and her male delivery driver's refusal to even say the word.
"What is there to hide? Will you get thrown in jail for buying pads?" she said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jenny Zhang, a 30-year-old I.T. worker and stand-up fan in Shanghai, said watching the female comedians had helped her recognize injustices in her own life.
"After you hear it, you feel yourself becoming more aware of your own emotions," she said. "Some things that you just thought were a little uncomfortable, you realize there's a problem behind it."
Still, even as the performers have broached once-taboo topics, they have not explicitly called themselves feminists. And they have left potentially more sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or sexual harassment, largely untouched.
But even if the jokes stay within the realm of the mundane, what matters is their appearance on mainstream platforms, said Xiaowen Liang, a feminist activist in New York who has participated in a popular Chinese-language feminist stand-up show there.
"Young women have already been talking about this a lot," she said of topics such as period shame. But "to let your male partners, elders, bosses, those kinds of people understand your experience -- that's extremely precious."
The emphasis on personal stories has also helped to keep references to gender inequality alive in pop culture, even as more overt activism has been crushed, said Dan Chen, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond who studies Chinese stand-up. Government censors are less likely to see such stories as political statements, she said.
"But if others resonate with you, then the message is sent," Professor Chen said, adding that stand-up, with its humor, allows women to deflect accusations of lecturing.
Still, even the relatively cautious approach has not been enough to stave off controversy, as shown when Ms. Yang appeared in an ad for JD.com's online pharmacy services this month.
Infuriated commenters called her an "extreme feminist," citing her 2020 joke about average-looking men. They promised to boycott the platform and filed customer service complaints claiming that the company didn't respect men.
Some pointed to JD.com's chief executive, a woman, as proof that toxic feminists had infiltrated the company. (The company's chairman, Richard Liu, was accused of rape in a U.S. court; the case was settled out of court in 2022.)
Four days after posting the ad with Ms. Yang, JD.com deleted it. "Recently, the participation of some stand-up comics in JD's promotional events attracted online attention. If this has brought you a bad experience, we deeply apologize!" it said in a statement. "Going forward, we have no plans to collaborate with the relevant performers."
JD.com also deleted posts featuring two other female comedians who have made jokes about men. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
To Ms. Yang's defenders, the controversy was not really about her, but about men's insecurity about women's rising status.
"Women's buying power and self-awareness are getting stronger and stronger. Appealing to this group is a very simple business decision," said Cheen Qin, a 40-year-old manager at an internet company in Shenzhen. But "men can't handle it," she said.
After she posted in support of Ms. Yang online, Ms. Qin said, a male former classmate called her stupid.
Still, many women said they hoped that female performers and audiences alike would continue to find an outlet in stand-up. (The genre can be fraught, no matter the performer's gender. Last year, stand-up shows across China were canceled after a male comedian made a joke that some nationalists online considered an insult to Chinese soldiers.)
Ms. Yang herself had already said, before the ad controversy, that she planned to focus more on smaller-scale shows, rather than television appearances. But she encouraged other women to ignore exhortations to talk about something other than gender.
"I just want to say, on behalf of people after me who may encounter the same problems: Going forward, this is all we're going to talk about!" she said. "If you're really offended, go watch something else."

Europe Imposes Higher Tariffs On Electric Cars Made in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tariffs, some as high as 45 percent, are intended to protect Europe's automotive sector, but they could escalate a trade war with China.
Consumers in Europe may face higher prices for electric vehicles made in China after tariffs on the cars came into effect on Wednesday as part of an effort by European leaders to create what they call a level playing field for domestic auto companies.
The higher tariffs stem from an investigation the European Union started into subsidies provided by Beijing that helped carmakers in China produce and sell electric vehicles, giving them a competitive edge over their European rivals.
Chinese automakers, already forced out of the U.S. market because of tariffs levied against them there, have called the E.U. tariffs "protectionist" and "arbitrary," arguing that their economies of scale have led to the rapid development of electric vehicle production.
The new tariffs, which come on top of existing import duties of 10 percent, are based on the amount of subsidies each automaker in China received, starting at 7.8 percent for Tesla and going up to 35.3 percent for SAIC Motor of Shanghai. They are to remain in place for five years.
How will tariffs protect European carmakers?
The automotive sector is crucial to Europe, employing 13.8 million people and accounting for 7 percent of the overall E.U. economic output. But Europe's automakers were slow to develop battery and gasoline-electric hybrid technologies for cars, instead spending decades focusing on trying to make diesel-fired combustion engines more efficient.
Only after Volkswagen was found to be cheating on its emissions in 2015 did the European automakers shift their focus to battery technology in earnest. By that time, Chinese car companies, including those like BYD that began as battery producers, had been working on electric cars for years.
The United States and Canada have both imposed 100 percent tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, but European leaders said they aimed to slow imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles rather than stop them altogether.
"Europe doesn't want to hamper its own electric vehicle green transition by making Chinese cars prohibitively expensive," said Emre Peker, a London-based director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a private consulting firm.
The market share of Chinese-made electric vehicles in the European Union has jumped to more than 20 percent from around 3 percent three years ago, according to ACEA, a European auto industry group. A failure to impose tariffs would have resulted in significant job losses in Europe, a senior European official said this week.
A senior European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per diplomatic practice, said the tariffs were critical for protecting the European auto industry.
What Europe's carmakers say about the tariffs.
European carmakers opposed the tariffs, with several countries, including Germany, home to BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, having voted against them. German carmakers have large investments in China and are concerned that the Chinese will retaliate.
Volkswagen has argued it was more important to maintain free and open markets than to seek to dampen competition.
"Under a tariffs regime, an industry only loses time," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's financial chief, told reporters in a call on Wednesday. The Chinese automakers "will sell cars from within Europe," he said.
Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, which owns more than a dozen brands including Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Peugeot and Ram, has also called the tariffs counterproductive.
"There should be no mistake these short-term actions will have negative mid- and long-term implications," Mr. Tavares said. "The best way -- the only way -- to protect ourselves, our industries, our workers is to compete with the newcomers and raise ourselves to their game."
How China has responded.
Chinese officials had hoped to avoid the tariffs, which they have called unfair. They have since charged that European producers of brandy, pork and dairy have dumped exports in China at low prices in violation of global trade rules.
Lin Jian, spokesman for China's foreign affairs ministry, said on Wednesday that the European Union's move would hurt the cooperation between the two sides, as well as Europe's efforts to address climate change.
"This is a typical act of trade protectionism," Mr. Lin said.
China's auto industry has suggested that its government impose tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars imported from the European Union in retaliation.
What happens next?
The European Commission said talks with China over a solution to the dispute would continue. The two sides have met eight times over the past year. But European officials say "significant remaining gaps" still exist.
European leaders said they were open to negotiating with individual car companies to set an agreed base price at which they could sell their cars in Europe. It was not immediately clear which companies would be involved in such talks.
Some Chinese automakers, such as BYD, have responded to the tariffs by setting up factories within the European Union or Turkey, which is within the European free trade zone. Leapmotor, another Chinese automaker, entered into a joint venture with Stellantis -- owner of the French brands Peugeot and Citroen, in addition to Jeep and Chrysler in the United States -- which will allow the company to produce its electric models in factories in Europe.

Last Relics of Giuliani's Heyday Join a Court-Ordered Fire Sale: [National Desk]

Full text: The trappings of Rudolph W. Giuliani's New York life are slipping away to pay $ 148 million to two election workers who sued for defamation.
The items read like a treasure trove of riches for New York royalty.
A 10-room apartment in a luxury cooperative one block from Central Park. A vintage convertible once owned by Lauren Bacall. Joe DiMaggio's No. 5 Yankees jersey, signed and framed.
On Tuesday, the owner of these valuables, Rudolph W. Giuliani, 80, must surrender them all, and more, to two election poll workers in Georgia, whom he defamed and who won a $ 148 million judgment in a lawsuit.
The order, by a Federal District Court judge last week, is an epilogue of sorts. Mr. Giuliani was once a respected mayor who fashioned himself as the quintessential New Yorker. And he was a leader admired far beyond the city before ultimately aligning himself with Donald J. Trump and promoting election conspiracy theories that cost him his reputation, his vocation and his broad appeal.
Now, barring any reconsideration by the court, Mr. Giuliani stands to lose something just as precious -- his carefully curated New York identity, built over decades in the spotlight, one trophy at a time. For a Brooklyn-born power broker, whose legal troubles have stripped him of his last home in the city, it approaches exile.
Mr. Giuliani has cited the court order in a fund-raising email for his legal defense.
"They want my home, my belongings, even all of the nostalgic keepsakes that I've collected throughout my 80 years of life," he wrote in the letter, before adding he will "NEVER SURRENDER the fight."
Still, the fire sale begins now.
Mr. Giuliani was found liable for defaming Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, two election poll workers who he claimed tried to steal the 2020 election from Mr. Trump. The women faced threats of violence and racist smears after Mr. Giuliani mentioned them repeatedly in media appearances. Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor in the 1980s, also faces criminal charges in two states for his attempts to keep Mr. Trump in office.
A path to seize Mr. Giuliani's assets, worth about $ 10 million, was cleared this summer. In late 2023, a jury awarded Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss the $ 148 million judgment. Mr. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy soon after, but failed to comply with basic court requirements.
Last Tuesday, a judge gave Mr. Giuliani one week to put the bulk of his possessions in a receivership controlled by the two women, who are likely to try to sell the items quickly.
Mr. Giuliani has until the end of Tuesday to comply with the court order, or he will face penalties that could include fines or possible jail time.
Ted Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, said the court has also restricted access to the former mayor's bank accounts and credit cards. Mr. Giuliani is appealing the court's decision, Mr. Goodman added.
"Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a man who has improved the lives of more people through public service than almost any other living American, is being unfairly punished by partisan, political activists who are trying to make an example out of him," Mr. Goodman said in a statement on Tuesday.
Lawyers for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Giuliani has been ordered to hand over nearly his entire estate, except, for now, his home in Florida, and three World Series Yankees rings that he claims to have given to his son, Andrew.
The list of Mr. Giuliani's belongings includes 26 designer watches. Two were given to him as gifts by the presidents of France and Italy for his leadership after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to court documents.
Another timepiece, inherited from his grandfather, Rudolfo, must also be forfeited.
There is his collection of sports memorabilia, including a signed photo of the Yankees legend Reggie Jackson, known as Mr. October for his heroics in postseason play. The Joe DiMaggio jersey, from 1951, the last active season for the Yankees great, hung above the wood-burning fireplace in Mr. Giuliani's library, where he recorded political podcasts.
Todd Sawatzky, a sports memorabilia appraiser in Niagara Falls, Canada, said that such a rare jersey could sell for over $ 10,000, but exponentially more if it was a game-worn shirt.
There is the 1980 Mercedes-Benz 500 SL, with 80,000 miles on it, which Mr. Giuliani said in October was his last remaining vehicle. (His driver's license is expired, he said in court.) He claimed the car was owned by Ms. Bacall, the film and Broadway star who lived for decades at the Dakota, one of New York's most storied apartment buildings.
Mr. Giuliani bought the car for $ 20,000, he said in the filings, because it made him feel like Humphrey Bogart, one of the great leading men in American cinema and Ms. Bacall's first husband.
"It was the quintessential, expensive, sort of playboy car," Tony Quiroga, the editor in chief of Car and Driver, said.
Then there is the fight over three Yankees World Series rings. George Steinbrenner, the team's mercurial late owner, had the rings made for Mr. Giuliani after three of the team's four championships during his time as mayor. Mr. Giuliani has claimed that he gave them to his son, Andrew and the rings are, for now, not subject to the seizure. In a phone call, Andrew Giuliani declined to comment, because litigation is ongoing.
Each is distinctive. The 2000 World Series ring, representing the Yankees' third win in a row, is made of 14-karat gold with the words "World Champions" surrounding a diamond-encrusted "NY" on a blue sapphire. In 2020, a similar ring, made for the former Yankee Chuck Knoblauch, was valued at between $ 40,000 to $ 60,000.
But the crown jewel of Mr. Giuliani's assets is the 10th-floor, three-bedroom aerie at 45 East 66th Street, a landmark co-op building on the Upper East Side. Mr. Giuliani moved into the apartment with his ex-wife, Judith Giuliani, in 2002, not long after being hailed as "America's mayor" by Oprah Winfrey for his stirring leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Much has changed since. In 2021, federal agents raided the apartment as part of an investigation into whether Mr. Giuliani had broken lobbying laws while serving as President Trump's personal lawyer.
In 2023, Mr. Giuliani listed the apartment for $ 6.5 million; a year later, he cut the price by 20 percent, which reflected poorly on the exclusive co-op, real estate brokers said. It was taken off the market in early October. Until a few weeks ago, the apartment was still Mr. Giuliani's primary residence
"The vibe has been horrific for quite a while" in the building, because of the negative publicity that Mr. Giuliani attracts, said Dolly Lenz, a real estate agent who has sold apartments in the building. The roughly 30-unit, prewar tower is home to a number of wealthy but otherwise low-profile residents, including bankers and diplomats.
The co-op board has prohibited residents from speaking publicly about Mr. Giuliani's recent departure from the building, according to building tenants.
The notoriety alone could have already affected the pricing of other apartments, Ms. Lenz said.
Some neighbors were vocal in their lack of sympathy for Mr. Giuliani.
"He sold his soul a long time ago," Judith Byrd, a renter in the building, said. "He totally brought it on himself, and a lot of people got hurt in the meantime," she added.
Not everyone agreed. Fred Stuart, a publicist and longtime renter in the building, said he exchanged niceties with Mr. Giuliani just a few weeks ago in the elevator.
"He's very likable," he said, adding that he should be granted some grace. "He did a lot for the city, and we shouldn't forget it."
What comes next for the apartment is unclear. If Mr. Giuliani successfully appeals the court's decision, a potential sale could be slowed or halted by the litigation, Michael Romer, a real estate lawyer, said. And if it does sell, part of the proceeds would most likely have to be paid to other creditors, he said.
"Who would really want to buy this property now, given all that is happening?" he asked.
Mr. Giuliani's only other apartment, a condo in a pink midcentury complex in Palm Beach, Fla., could soon be subject to a similar seizure.
He has a January court date to determine if he can claim the Florida apartment as his primary residence, to spare it from creditors.
Some have already noticed Mr. Giuliani's absence. John Sotello, a service captain at Bar Italia, a bistro near the former mayor's building, said Mr. Giuliani used to stop in unannounced and take pictures with diners.
"We miss him," he said. "As a person, as a politician and as a customer."

The items read like a treasure trove of riches for New York royalty.
A 10-room apartment in a luxury cooperative one block from Central Park. A vintage convertible once owned by Lauren Bacall. Joe DiMaggio’s No. 5 New York Yankees jersey, signed and framed.
On Tuesday, the owner of these valuables, Rudy Giuliani, 80, must surrender them all, and more, to two election poll workers in Georgia, whom he defamed and who won a $148 million judgment in a lawsuit.
The order, by a U.S. District Court judge last week, is an epilogue of sorts. Giuliani was once a respected mayor who fashioned himself as the quintessential New Yorker. He was a leader admired far beyond the city before ultimately aligning himself with Donald Trump and promoting election conspiracy theories that cost him his reputation, his vocation and his broad appeal.
Now, barring any reconsideration by the court, Giuliani stands to lose something just as precious — his carefully curated New York identity, built over decades in the spotlight, one trophy at a time. For a Brooklyn-born power broker, whose legal troubles have stripped him of his last home in the city, it approaches exile.
Giuliani has cited the court order in a fundraising email for his legal defense.
“They want my home, my belongings, even all of the nostalgic keepsakes that I’ve collected throughout my 80 years of life,” he wrote in the letter, before adding he will “NEVER SURRENDER the fight.”
Still, the fire sale begins now.
Giuliani was found liable for defaming Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, two election poll workers who he claimed tried to steal the 2020 election from Trump. The women faced threats of violence and racist smears after Giuliani mentioned them repeatedly in media appearances. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor in the 1980s, also faces criminal charges in two states for his attempts to keep Trump in office.
A path to seize Giuliani’s assets, worth about $10 million, was cleared this summer. In late 2023, a jury awarded Freeman and Moss the $148 million judgment. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy soon after, but failed to comply with basic court requirements.
Last Tuesday, a judge gave Giuliani one week to put the bulk of his possessions in a receivership controlled by the two women, who are likely to try to sell the items quickly.
Giuliani has until the end of Tuesday to comply with the court order or he faces penalties that could include fines or possible jail time.
Giuliani “is being unfairly punished by partisan, political activists who are trying to make an example out of him,” Ted Goodman, his spokesperson, said in a statement last week.
Lawyers for Freeman and Moss did not respond to requests for comment.
Giuliani has been ordered to hand over nearly his entire estate, except, for now, his home in Florida, and three World Series Yankees rings that he claims to have given to his son, Andrew.
The list of Giuliani’s belongings includes 26 designer watches. Two were given to him as gifts by the presidents of France and Italy for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to court documents.
Another timepiece, inherited from his grandfather, Rudolfo, must also be forfeited.
There is his collection of sports memorabilia, including a signed photo of Yankees legend Reggie Jackson, known as Mr. October for his heroics in postseason play. The Joe DiMaggio jersey, from 1951, the last active season for the Yankees great, hung above the wood-burning fireplace in Giuliani’s library, where he recorded political podcasts.
Todd Sawatzky, a sports memorabilia appraiser in Niagara Falls, Ontario, said that such a rare jersey could sell for over $10,000, but exponentially more if it was a game-worn shirt.
There is the 1980 Mercedes-Benz 500 SL, with 80,000 miles on it, which Giuliani said in October was his last remaining vehicle. (His driver’s license is expired, he said in court.) He claimed the car was owned by Bacall, the film and Broadway star who lived for decades at the Dakota, one of New York’s most storied apartment buildings.
Giuliani bought the car for $20,000, he said in the filings, because it made him feel like Humphrey Bogart, one of the great leading men in American cinema and Bacall’s first husband.
“It was the quintessential, expensive, sort of playboy car,” said Tony Quiroga, the editor-in-chief of Car and Driver.
Then there is the fight over three Yankees World Series rings. George Steinbrenner, the team’s mercurial late owner, had the rings made for Giuliani after three of the team’s four championships during his time as mayor. Giuliani has claimed that he gave them to his son, Andrew and the rings are, for now, not subject to the seizure. In a phone call, Andrew Giuliani declined to comment, because litigation is ongoing.
Each is distinctive. The 2000 World Series ring, representing the Yankees’ third win in a row, is made of 14-karat gold with the words “World Champions” surrounding a diamond-encrusted “NY” on a blue sapphire. In 2020, a similar ring, made for former Yankee Chuck Knoblauch, was valued at between $40,000 to $60,000.
But the crown jewel of Giuliani’s assets is the 10th-floor, three-bedroom aerie at 45 E. 66th St., a landmark co-op building on the Upper East Side. Giuliani moved into the apartment with future wife Judith Giuliani in 2002, not long after being hailed as “America’s mayor” by Oprah Winfrey for his stirring leadership after 9/11.
Much has changed since. In 2021, federal agents raided the apartment as part of an investigation into whether Giuliani had broken lobbying laws while serving as Trump’s personal lawyer.
In 2023, Giuliani listed the apartment for $6.5 million; a year later, he cut the price by 20%, which reflected poorly on the exclusive co-op, real estate brokers said. It was taken off the market in early October. Until a few weeks ago, the apartment was still Giuliani’s primary residence
“The vibe has been horrific for quite a while” in the building, because of the negative publicity that Giuliani attracts, said Dolly Lenz, a real estate agent who has sold apartments in the building. The roughly 30-unit, prewar tower is home to a number of wealthy but otherwise low-profile residents, including bankers and diplomats.
The co-op board has prohibited residents from speaking publicly about Giuliani’s recent departure from the building, according to building tenants.
The notoriety alone could have already affected the pricing of other apartments, Lenz said.
Some neighbors were vocal in their lack of sympathy for Giuliani.
“It couldn’t happen to a better guy,” said Judith Byrd, a renter in the building.
Not everyone agreed. Fred Stuart, a publicist and longtime renter in the building, said he exchanged niceties with Giuliani just a few weeks ago in the elevator.
“He’s very likable,” he said, adding that he should be granted some grace. “He did a lot for the city, and we shouldn’t forget it.”
What comes next for the apartment is unclear. If Giuliani successfully appeals the court’s decision, a potential sale could be slowed or halted by the litigation, Michael Romer, a real estate lawyer, said. And if it does sell, part of the proceeds would most likely have to be paid to other creditors, he said.
“Who would really want to buy this property now, given all that is happening?” he asked.
Giuliani’s only other apartment, a condo in a pink midcentury complex in Palm Beach, Florida, could soon be subject to a similar seizure.
He has a January court date to determine if he can claim the Florida apartment as his primary residence, to spare it from creditors.
Some have already noticed Giuliani’s absence. John Sotello, a service captain at Bar Italia, a bistro near the former mayor’s building, said Giuliani used to stop in unannounced and take pictures with diners.
“We miss him,” he said. “As a person, as a politician and as a customer.”

Paying an Influencer for Lessons: [Style Desk]

Full text: Valeria Lipovetsky brings in millions of dollars as an online personality. Now she's teaching aspirants what she's learned -- for a price.
In August, the energy inside the event space of a hotel in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, was first-day-of-school jitters meets sorority initiation ceremony. The room was bustling with about 50 women, mostly in their 30s, dressed in similar colors (neutrals with a pop of red) and similar silhouettes (trousers, maxi skirts and vested tops), per the styling mood board they received the previous week.
Over the course of five hours, they listened to a panel, participated in a Q. and A. session and broke out into small groups -- as one might at a business conference.
This gathering, however, also included a "content creation" hour, during which attendees were encouraged to collaborate on videos and photos. Ring lights glared around the room as everyone claimed their space. They were learning how to be influencers.
This was the first class of students at Creator Method, an online content creation academy founded by Valeria Lipovetsky, 34, and her husband, Gary Lipovetsky, 51. The venture is an offshoot of their company Valeria Inc., which supports Ms. Lipovetsky's career as a fashion and lifestyle influencer. On TikTok and Instagram -- where she has 2.3 million and 1.8 million followers -- she posts reels of her getting dressed, glimpses into her three sons' lives and snippets from her podcast, "Not Alone," where she talks to mostly female guests about relationships and wellness. She says her collection of social media brands earn her about $ 13.5 million over the span of her influencer career.
Ms. Lipovetsky, wearing a pea-green dress and with her sons Benjamin, 9, and Maximus, 5, in tow, had pledged to teach this group of young women her methods.
Her school for influencing, which she rolled out in May, has no course work, no exams and no certification of any kind. The $ 3,000 annual membership fee gives students access to a library of over 80 (and counting) prerecorded video lessons; weekly Zoom calls with the Lipovetskies and Rachel Ostro, the chief executive of Valeria Inc.; and private group chats.
Lessons include instructions on attracting brand partnerships, lectures on the importance of consistent posting and best iPhone practices. IRL events, like the one in August, are included in the cost.
"I feel like Creator Method is part of what we think future education will look like," Ms. Lipovetsky said.
There has perhaps never before been more demand for Ms. Lipovetsky's teachings. The creator economy is currently worth $ 250 billion, and it's predicted to be worth around $ 480 billion by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs Research. As the industry booms, a Morning Consult survey last year found that more than half of Gen Z-ers aspire to be influencers and see it as a viable career path.
Many people who have found success in social media influencing have done so without any special training or lectures; some have stumbled into it completely by accident. With its high price tag and educational promises, Ms. Lipovetsky's course has some people cautioning skepticism.
"It's buyer beware," said Jeff Hancock, the founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab at Stanford University and a professor of communication.
It's one thing, Professor Hancock said, "if you want to have a consulting firm or if somebody were like, 'Hey we know how this stuff works.' But to argue that it's an educational thing, that's when I think you can run into trouble."
'You don't actually have to have talent' "I was really, really surprised and grateful to have gotten in that early in my creator journey," said Murielle Simplice, 28, a registered nurse from Ottawa, Canada, who creates wellness content. She was accepted with 76 followers.
Ina Melendez, 35, said she thought the academy was "exclusive in a good way," and told herself, "if they accept me, then that's a sign."
As of July, the acceptance rate was 93 percent.
While a few students are stay-at-home mothers or wives, others have full-time jobs -- sex therapist, air traffic controller, surgeon and dance instructor, among them -- and are there to create content that either supports their primary career or as a way to transition into full-time influencing.
The 119 women and one man who made up the student body ranged in age from 20-something to 50-something. Would-be influencers come from all over the world, including Qatar and New Zealand. The median follower count for the 120 enrolled students was about 6,000 as of September; some attendees, like Ms. Simplice, had followers only in the double or triple digits, while others came in with as many as 250,000.
Mr. Lipovetsky frequently refers to his wife as "the Oprah of her generation," but to promote Creator Method he reassured aspirants that they need not be a once-in-a-lifetime personality. In order to succeed as an influencer, he said: "You need to believe you have talent. You don't actually have to have talent."
Ms. Lipovetsky started creating content at 26 -- posting vlogs on YouTube with a focus on nutrition and recipes. Over the past eight years, she has expanded to fashion and lifestyle, bringing in brand partnerships with big name brands like Amazon, H&M, Mercedes-Benz and Chanel.
Alison Cheperdak, 34, an etiquette coach from Washington, D.C., said she was posting almost daily before enrolling, but she ramped up once the courses began. In the few months since enrolling, she has seen her Instagram followers rise from 185,000 to 303,000. Previously, she was a law clerk on three U.S. Senate committees and an assistant staff secretary in the Trump White House.
"It's recommended that we post two reels a day to Instagram, at a minimum, and perhaps an additional carousel post," Ms. Cheperdak said.
But a quick search online will generate tons of resources offering this tip for free. Lucy Renouf, 27, a former dancer based in Sussex, England, who creates lifestyle content about her home renovation and raising a puppy, has never sought out any professional guidance on influencing. She said she decided to get serious about becoming an influencer in 2022 by committing to daily posts for 100 days -- she amassed 100,000 followers in four months, she said, primarily using tips she found by searching online. (Now she has 470,000 followers on Instagram and an agent.)
And some Creator Method students have found success because of the internet's whims.
Two months into the academy, Bianca Comanescu had about 300 Instagram followers when one reel -- which was captioned "when you reach the ripe old age of 26 and going out two nights in a row feels like the olympics" -- went viral to the tune of 10 million views, which gained her an additional 7,000 followers. The reel, however, didn't attract her target demographic: women interested in fashion. Instead, it skewed her ratio of followers to 80 percent male, she said.
Others say forming communities with other influencers -- with no cost of admission -- can be just as effective in helping boost their profiles online.
"I think people would be surprised how generous and kind so many other creators are in helping people build their business," said Ilana Torbiner, a fashion influencer in Chicago who is not part of Ms. Lipovetsky's content creation course.
Becoming the Tony Robbins of influencing
Creator Method is still in its infancy, but their goal to enroll 100,000 people -- only 4 percent of Ms. Lipovetsky's following -- which would amount to a cash flow of $ 300 million, if the program stays at the current fee. (Ms. Ostro, the chief executive, said, "If anything, I want to increase the price.")
Ms. Ostro and Mr. Lipovetsky say they are looking at how Tony Robbins, the inspirational speaker and life coach, has scaled his multi-million-dollar educational platform.
"There are people who are Tony Robbins fans who travel together, but they have no affiliation with Tony Robbins," Ms. Ostro said. "They somehow do find each other."
Creator Method isn't the only content creation program available, but it's one of the few that doesn't advertise itself promising large follower gains. Natalie Ellis, founder of Boss Babe, started her influencer school in October 2021, promoting proven methods for quickly boosting audiences, and said that 3,760 people have enrolled since then. She divides her 12-week course into "freshman," "sophomore" and "junior" year, and gives participants a certificate at the end.
"The program is really designed to help them get clear on their brand and be able to grow an audience, and get that engine going," Ms. Ellis said.
Some say there is a need for people with expertise to share their knowledge about influencing with others -- and it's not something that's taught in many traditional academic institutions.
"I think there's a real need out there for relevant and reliable instruction," said Robert Kwortnik, an associate professor at Cornell's SC Johnson College of Business.
But others aren't so sure about the pitch some instructors are making to aspiring influencers.
"They almost all really hammer the kind of ideology of entrepreneurship," said Angèle Christin, an associate professor at Stanford University's department of communication. She studies influencers and took more than a dozen online content creation courses as part of her research.
Part of that ideology, she said, is emphasizing to students that they have an opportunity " to refashion your life the way you want it to be and escape the grind of the 9-to-5 job."'
But it's no surprise how appealing that notion can be, and plenty of people seem to think that learning from Ms. and Mr. Lipovetsky is worth the $ 3,000 -- and that their guidance produces results.
"I wouldn't say that I have grown from a creative standpoint, but I feel like I'm growing so much from a business standpoint," said Mona Said, 28. Mr. Lipovetsky suggested that Ms. Said mention "partnerships" in her Instagram bio to attract more brand deals. "A week later, two brands reached out to me," she said.
Like any school, it may come down to how a student applies herself.
One attendee, Rosa Hoffman, 37, who creates skin care content, compared the program to therapy.
"They just tell you to do the work," she said. "And if you don't do it, you can't expect to grow."

Applying to Advance a ‘Creator Journey’
To be admitted to Lipovetsky’s influencer school, students don’t only have to pay; they have to apply.
“I was really, really surprised and grateful to have gotten in that early in my creator journey,” said Murielle Simplice, 28, a registered nurse from Ottawa, Ontario, who creates wellness content. She was accepted with 76 followers.

Lucy Renouf, 27, a former dancer based in Sussex, England, who creates lifestyle content about her home renovation and raising a puppy, has never sought out any professional guidance on influencing. She said she decided to get serious about becoming an influencer in 2022 by committing to daily posts for 100 days — she amassed 100,000 followers in four months, she said, primarily using tips she found by searching online. (Now, she has 470,000 followers on Instagram and an agent.)
And some Creator Method students have found success because of the internet’s whims.
Two months into the academy, Bianca Comanescu had about 300 Instagram followers when one reel — which was captioned “when you reach the ripe old age of 26 and going out two nights in a row feels like the olympics” — went viral to the tune of 10 million views, which gained her an additional 7,000 followers. The reel, however, didn’t attract her target demographic: women interested in fashion. Instead, it skewed her ratio of followers to 80% male, she said.
Others say forming communities with other influencers — with no cost of admission — can be just as effective in helping boost their profiles online.
“I think people would be surprised how generous and kind so many other creators are in helping people build their business,” said Ilana Torbiner, a fashion influencer in Chicago who is not part of Lipovetsky’s content creation course.
Becoming the Tony Robbins of Influencing
Creator Method is still in its infancy, but its goal is to enroll 100,000 people — only 4% of Lipovetsky’s following — which would amount to a cash flow of $300 million, if the program stays at the current fee. (Ostro said, “If anything, I want to increase the price.”)
Ostro and Gary Lipovetsky say they are looking at how Tony Robbins, an inspirational speaker and life coach, has scaled his multimillion-dollar educational platform.
“There are people who are Tony Robbins fans who travel together, but they have no affiliation with Tony Robbins,” Ostro said. “They somehow do find each other.”
Creator Method isn’t the only content creation program available, but it’s one of the few that doesn’t advertise itself promising large follower gains. Natalie Ellis, founder of Boss Babe, started her influencer school in October 2021, promoting proven methods for quickly boosting audiences, and said that 3,760 people have enrolled since then. She divides her 12-week course into “freshman,” “sophomore” and “junior" year, and gives participants a certificate at the end.
“The program is really designed to help them get clear on their brand and be able to grow an audience, and get that engine going,” Ellis said.
Some say there is a need for people with expertise to share their knowledge about influencing with others — and it’s not something that’s taught in many traditional academic institutions.
“I think there’s a real need out there for relevant and reliable instruction,” said Robert Kwortnik, an associate professor at Cornell’s SC Johnson College of Business.
But others aren’t so sure about the pitch that some instructors are making to aspiring influencers.
“They almost all really hammer the kind of ideology of entrepreneurship,” said Angèle Christin, an associate professor at Stanford University’s department of communication. She studies influencers and took more than a dozen online content creation courses as part of her research.
Part of that ideology, she said, is emphasizing to students that they have an opportunity “to refashion your life the way you want it to be and escape the grind of the 9-to-5 job.’”
But it’s no surprise how appealing that notion can be, and plenty of people seem to think that learning from the Lipovetskys is worth the $3,000 — and that their guidance produces results.
“I wouldn’t say that I have grown from a creative standpoint, but I feel like I’m growing so much from a business standpoint,” said Mona Said, 28. Gary Lipovetsky suggested that Said mention “partnerships” in her Instagram bio to attract more brand deals. “A week later, two brands reached out to me,” she said.
Like any school, it may come down to how a student applies herself.
One attendee, Rosa Hoffman, 37, who creates skin-care content, compared the program to therapy.
“They just tell you to do the work,” she said. “And if you don’t do it, you can’t expect to grow.”

Waymo Funding Round Valued at $ 5.6 Billion
Alphabet's self-driving unit, Waymo, said on Friday that it had closed a $ 5.6 billion funding round led by Alphabet, the Google parent, as it looks to expand its autonomous ride-hailing service.
Automakers and technology companies are investing in autonomous ride-hailing services to capitalize on the technology to drive commercial success, even as it faces regulatory scrutiny.
The investment round also saw participation from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek and T. Rowe Price, Waymo said.
"With this latest investment, we will continue to welcome more riders into our Waymo One ride-hailing service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and in Austin and Atlanta through our expanded partnership with Uber," the company said.
Alphabet had planned a $ 5 billion investment in Waymo over a multiyear period, an executive said in July. REUTERS

Mercedes-Benz Plans
To Ramp Up Cost Cuts
Mercedes-Benz will step up cost cuts after earnings halved in the third quarter hit by tepid demand and fierce competition in China, it said on Friday.
The luxury carmaker cut its full-year profit margin target twice during the third quarter, joining a growing number of European rivals blaming a weakening Chinese car market for falling profits and margins.
Union Investment, which according to LSEG is among the 30 top investors in Mercedes, called on the management to amend its strategy as it sees no market for 2 million luxury cars any longer.
"We are clearly in favor of adjusting the strategy and adapting it to the new market conditions and the new competition from China," said portfolio manager Moritz Kronenberger.
Mercedes refuses to participate in the price war in China and prefers to stick to its "value over volume" strategy. REUTERS
TECHNOLOGY
Meta Platforms to Use Reuters for Chatbot
Meta Platforms said on Friday its artificial intelligence chatbot will use Reuters content to answer user questions in real time about news and current events, the latest AI tie-up between a big technology company and a news publisher.
Neither Meta nor Reuters-parent Thomson Reuters disclosed the financial details of the partnership. The arrangement would be its first news deal in years. It comes at a time when the Facebook parent has been reducing news content on its services after criticism from regulators and publishers over misinformation.
Meta AI, the company's chatbot, is available across its services including Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The social media giant did not disclose whether it plans to use Reuters content to train its large-language model.
Reuters already has a fact-checking partnership with Meta, which began in 2020. REUTERS

Giuliani Ordered to Forfeit Millions in Assets to Workers He Defamed: [National Desk]

Full text: The onetime personal attorney to former President Donald J. Trump has seven days to turn over his Manhattan apartment, a vintage Mercedes-Benz and other possessions.
A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Rudolph W. Giuliani to turn over most of his possessions and available cash to a receivership controlled by the two Georgia election workers he defamed after the last presidential election.
Mr. Giuliani, 80, has seven days to make the transfer, which includes his New York apartment and his vintage Mercedes-Benz, once owned by the actress Lauren Bacall. The judge also ordered him to turn over certain pieces of furniture, his television, sports memorabilia, jewelry and 26 watches, including one that Mr. Giuliani said his grandfather gave him.
"The watch may be distinctive to defendant as an item of sentimental value, but it is not distinctive to the law," Judge Lewis J. Liman of Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote in the order issued on Tuesday. For now, Mr. Giuliani's son, Andrew, can hold on to his father's Yankee World Series rings while lawyers look into whether they were indeed a gift from father to son, as Andrew Giuliani has told the court.
Once the transfers are made, the two election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, can begin selling the assets and putting the proceeds toward the more than $ 148 million a federal jury determined he owes them. Judge Liman also said Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss could sue former President Donald J. Trump for the $ 2 million he owes Mr. Giuliani in unpaid legal bills.
Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss have been waiting nearly a year to be paid for the damage to their reputations caused by Mr. Giuliani, a onetime personal lawyer to Mr. Trump and mayor of New York. Mr. Giuliani has reported about $ 10 million in assets.
After the 2020 election, Mr. Giuliani spread false statements that the women tried to steal the election from Mr. Trump. The accusations circulated swiftly across social media and led to violent threats against the women and their families.
"Our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani's actions," said one of their lawyers, Aaron Nathan of Willkie Farr & Gallagher.
In a statement Tuesday evening, lawyers representing Mr. Giuliani said Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss would have to return the assets if Mr. Giuliani successfully appealed the $ 148 million judgment.
"Stay tuned," the lawyers, Kenneth Caruso and David Labkowski, wrote in an email. "When the judgment is reversed in the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., these plaintiffs will be required to return all this property to Mr. Giuliani."
But unless Mr. Giuliani's appeal results in the judgment being vacated or reduced to less than $ 10 million -- which is what his assets are worth -- it is not likely that Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss would have to return anything.
The women filed a defamation suit against Mr. Giuliani in December 2021. Over the course of two years, Mr. Giuliani refused to respond to discovery requests about his businesses and earnings. He was so uncooperative that the judge overseeing the case, Beryl A. Howell, ruled that he was liable for defaming the two women. A federal jury in Washington decided he owed them $ 148 million.
The judgment prompted Mr. Giuliani to file for bankruptcy last December. His case was dismissed from bankruptcy court eight months later because he refused to comply with basic reporting procedures.
"Our clients have been around the block with Mr. Giuliani quite a lot," Mr. Nathan said during a Sept. 27 hearing.
If Mr. Giuliani does not comply with Judge Liman's seven-day order, he could face being held in contempt of court, which could result in fines or even jail time.
The order covers about $ 6.5 million worth of assets, excluding the value of his condo in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Giuliani faces a January trial in Manhattan over whether he can claim that the Florida condo is his primary residence and therefore not eligible to be seized by his creditors under Florida law. But lawyers for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss say that is not enough under Florida law to establish primary residency. Judge Liman, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, said Mr. Giuliani was not allowed to do anything that would downgrade the value of the Palm Beach condo in the meantime.
If the case goes to trial, it will put Mr. Giuliani in the defendant's seat in a district he once oversaw as a U.S. attorney in the 1980s.
Since the 2020 election, Mr. Giuliani has lost his licenses to practice law in New York and Washington, D.C. He also faces criminal trials in Arizona and Georgia related to his efforts to keep Mr. Trump in office.

Expanding the N.F.L.'s Financial Field of Play: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Under the expansionist leadership of its commissioner, the National Football League is growing richer and richer. So, too, is Mr. Goodell.
As they met in the lobby of the Omni Viking Lakes Hotel in Minnesota in late August, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, greeted each other warmly, sharing fist bumps as a small entourage that included their oldest sons surrounded them.
"Boy, you're looking trim," Mr. Jones, wearing a light blue jacket with a diamond star pin on his lapel, told Mr. Kraft, wearing his signature Nike dress sneakers. The two men, who have nine Super Bowl wins between them (six for Mr. Kraft, 83, and three for Mr. Jones, who turns 82 on Sunday), were upbeat and refreshed after their summer vacations in the South of France and the Hamptons.
Soon they were joined in the lobby by other N.F.L. royalty: the Kansas City Chiefs owner, Clark Hunt; the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, Art Rooney II; and, most significant, Roger Goodell, the league commissioner. There were smiles all around -- and for good reason.
Over the next three hours, Mr. Goodell, 65, would preside over yet another decision that would make these already extremely wealthy individuals even richer: The league's owners voted 31 to 1 to allow teams to sell up to 10 percent of their multibillion-dollar clubs to private equity groups.
Afterward, as other owners slipped into their waiting limousines, Mr. Jones, the most ardent proponent of growing the league, said to a gaggle of waiting reporters: "This is good for anybody that's in love with the N.F.L., any part of it -- the game part, on the field, off the field. This is a good thing."
The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball tapped private equity money years ago. But the N.F.L. is the largest league with the best long-term prospects, which is why firms like Arctos Partners, Sixth Street Partners and others have been eager to bid for stakes in the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins and other clubs. By year's end, owners of N.F.L. teams, worth on average $ 6.5 billion, may get nine-figure checks to help pay for new stadiums, buy out partners or retire debt.
The private equity move is the latest financial milestone in Mr. Goodell's 18-year stewardship of the N.F.L. The son of a politician, he has spent his entire career in the league, starting as an intern after college, then climbing the ladder by tackling an array of jobs, including overseeing its international expansion and strong-arming cities to subsidize stadiums. By the time Mr. Goodell was elected commissioner in 2006, succeeding Paul Tagliabue, he was well aware that Mr. Jones, Mr. Kraft and other owners who had paid nine and 10 figures for their teams wanted faster returns on their investments.
Mr. Goodell has been the man to make sure that happens, with a series of aggressive moves over the past two decades that have made the N.F.L. the wealthiest sports league in the world.
While its financial prowess has been lauded in sports business circles, some of its growth has come at the expense of the players who have to play expanded schedules with less recovery time and a greater risk of injury. Fans, too, are having to shell out more to attend games or watch their favorite sport on television, with streaming services like Amazon, Peacock and Netflix showing more N.F.L. games -- including playoff contests -- that used to be the sole province of network TV and basic cable.
"They're doing what other leagues are doing, but from the highest mountaintop in the industry," said Robert Boland, a former N.F.L. agent who teaches sports law at Seton Hall University. "The big leagues are all moving away from a live product consumed by everyday men and women, but because the N.F.L. was so available for so long, there's some pain attached to this."
An Audacious Target
In 2010, at the league's annual meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes, in Florida, Mr. Goodell and his chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, unveiled an audacious target: The N.F.L. would hit $ 25 billion in revenue by 2027. The league generated about $ 8 billion at the time, double the amount it had 17 years earlier. Now, Mr. Goodell wanted to more than triple its revenue in the next 17 years. Owners and executives in the room shared sideways glances.
The N.F.L. was the country's most lucrative league, but it was facing headwinds from a deep recession and a labor deal that the owners felt had given the players too big a share of the revenue. The owners were optimistic by nature, but not that optimistic.
"You know, Roger always speaks confidently, and him saying it not all that far into his reign as commissioner, I have to admit, it was quite a statement," said Steve Underwood, a former Tennessee Titans general counsel, who attended the meeting. "I didn't see how he could achieve that, to be deadly blunt."
With the league now in its 105th season, Mr. Goodell's goal is no longer an ambitious dream; it's becoming a reality. The league has grown by about $ 1 billion a year since 2010 and now generates more than $ 20 billion in annual revenue.
In 2021, the league signed media rights contracts -- its largest source of revenue -- worth more than $ 110 billion, about twice the amount of prior deals. CBS, Fox and NBC agreed to pay more than $ 2 billion annually to hold on to their slots to broadcast games. And ESPN is shelling out about $ 2.7 billion a year to continue airing "Monday Night Football," and to be added into the rotation to broadcast the Super Bowl beginning in 2026.
In 2020, the owners persuaded the players to accept an additional 17th regular-season game, and in 2021, they added extra playoff games, changes that increased revenue even more. In April, at the N.F.L. draft in Detroit, Mr. Goodell floated the idea of an 18th regular-season game, a contentious proposal that would extend the season to Presidents' Day weekend in late February. Revenue has also poured in from new stadiums in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond.
"I thought the target was aggressive but, to be honest, achievable," Mr. Kraft said, referring to the commissioner's goal of achieving $ 25 billion in revenue by 2027. "I'm proud of Roger for putting it on the table to motivate everyone in the league office and the business management of teams that we all had to pull it together and try and make that happen."
As the league has prospered, so has Mr. Goodell: About 90 percent of the commissioner's compensation is tied to a basket of metrics and incentives. After securing lucrative labor and broadcast deals and steering the league through the Covid-19 pandemic without missing a game, he received $ 63,900,050 in each of the fiscal years running from April 2019 to March 2020 and April 2020 to March 2021, making him one of the highest-paid executives in the country. In October, Mr. Goodell signed an extension that will keep him atop the league through March 2027, when he will be 68. (Mr. Goodell declined to be interviewed for this article.)
An Unstoppable Juggernaut
One of Mr. Goodell's other big jobs is to shield the owners from controversies. In 2014, he was widely criticized for his two-game suspension of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after video showed him dragging his fiancée out of a hotel elevator. The criticism turned into a national uproar when a subsequent video showed Mr. Rice knocking her unconscious. (Mr. Goodell suspended Mr. Rice indefinitely after the release of the second video. An arbitrator nullified that decision, saying Mr. Rice could not be penalized twice for the same offense.)
Three years later, the commissioner was chastised -- including by President Donald J. Trump -- for his handling of protests by dozens of players who knelt during the playing of the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and social injustice.
But Mr. Goodell has emerged from those and other controversies with the support of ownership primarily for one reason: He keeps making them money.
Last year, 93 of the top 100 programs on television were N.F.L. games. The number of N.F.L. fans has increased to about 210 million, up from 170 million about a decade ago, according to figures supplied by the league. But the N.F.L. has grown in part because Mr. Goodell and the owners take small, careful steps, not bold leaps. The new private equity investment rules fit that pattern.
The owners began discussing accepting private equity in 2019 but chose to watch how other leagues handled the process first. The N.F.L. wanted to preserve its governance structure, which relies heavily on owners to make most key decisions affecting the league. The owners were also wary of diluting the control of the multigenerational families that own the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants, the Steelers and other teams.
Most of those families have their wealth wrapped up in their teams and lack the cash to build splashy stadiums. As the value of teams has soared -- the Washington Commanders fetched a record $ 6 billion in 2023, despite having a 32-49-1 record the previous five years -- they have found it harder to attract bidders with pockets deep enough to buy minority stakes that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Private equity firms have access to billions of dollars and have been eager investors in the sports world. But they have a reputation for slashing costs at companies they acquire and flipping them for a quick profit, potential turmoil the N.F.L. owners want to avoid.
So last year, Mr. Goodell created a committee that included Mr. Hunt, Mr. Kraft, the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, the Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, the Denver Broncos chief executive Greg Penner and the Commanders owner Josh Harris to design rules so teams could tap private equity money while keeping the firms at arms length.
At a meeting in August, the league's owners approved investment by four private equity groups. Three of them -- Arctos, Sixth Street and Ares Management -- can invest in no more than six teams at a time. The fourth group, a consortium that includes Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, can invest in up to 12 teams.
"We tried to talk to people who we think are in the know, and I think we were patient on this," Mr. Goodell said to reporters after the meeting. "We hope by taking what we think are the blue-chip firms that this will be a successful approach for everyone at the N.F.L., the investors and the firms. So we think we found the right model."
An 18th Game
Soon after having back surgery, Mr. Goodell flew to Detroit in April to host the draft, where players have traditionally walked onstage after being selected by a team and bear-hugged the commissioner. (Players were told to avoid doing so this year, but at least one, JC Latham, ignored the directive.)
The draft is an example of how Mr. Goodell has maximized the N.F.L.'s popularity. In 2015, the league moved the three-day event out of New York City, its longtime home, to Chicago, Nashville, Las Vegas and elsewhere, drawing larger crowds each year, including a record 750,000 fans in Detroit.
During the draft, Mr. Goodell said in an interview on ESPN that he favored adding an extra regular-season game. The owners have long craved an 18th game because it would mean more ticket revenue and money from broadcasters. But the league needs the players to agree, and union reps quickly voiced their opposition, saying it could further endanger the players' health.
"Yeah, 18 games sounds great when Roger is saying it on Pat McAfee's," said the Indianapolis Colts center Ryan Kelly, a member of the union's executive committee, referring to the ESPN interview. "But until you're the one going out there and putting a helmet on for 18 of those games, yeah, then come talk to me."
Not every owner favors an expanded schedule, either.
"People seem to think that it's a fait accompli, and maybe it will happen," John Mara, a co-owner of the Giants, said. But, he added, "I'm not a big fan of it. The season is long enough as it is."
But Mr. Mara is in the minority. Brian Rolapp, the league's top media and business officer, said that like many large companies, the league suffered from the "tyranny of big numbers" and must work harder to find new revenue. An 18-game schedule is one way to do that.
"It's a cliché, but I'll say it: Complacency is an enemy," Mr. Rolapp said.
Speaking of Mr. Goodell's predecessor, he added: "Paul Tagliabue had a line I remember. He said, 'If it ain't broke, fix it anyway.' I think there's a healthy paranoia here about how do you keep it going? How do you keep it growing? How do you keep it fresh?"
Teams are also contributing, Mr. Rolapp said. The Falcons, for example, are attracting more high-end fans to Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta by adding field-level suites behind the team benches that sell out at every event. Living-room-type suites on the second deck were added and sponsored by AT&T. The team opened a two-level private club, where members pay $ 15,000 a season. The club is sold out.
"It's the champagne kind of service crowd down there," the Falcons president Greg Beadles said.
These amenities are one reason the average cost of attending a game has jumped 44 percent since 2015, according to Freebets.com. But watching games at home has become more expensive, too, as the N.F.L. airs more of them exclusively on streaming platforms, which require subscriptions that can cost hundreds of dollars a year.
Mr. Goodell has defended the strategy, saying that fewer younger fans have cable television packages, so putting games on streaming services is a way to reach them.
"We have to fish where the fish are," Mr. Goodell said at the Super Bowl in February. "For us, it's part of the future."
Flag Football at the Olympics
The notion that the N.F.L. was greedy -- or too greedy, depending on your view -- was partly why Mr. Goodell flew to Los Angeles in June to testify in the antitrust trial brought by customers of the subscription service Sunday Ticket. The plaintiffs claimed that the league had colluded with CBS and Fox to inflate prices of the service, which shows all out-of-market games on Sundays. Mr. Goodell had never appeared as a witness in a federal trial, but the stakes were high because the case challenged a core of the league's business model: exclusive agreements with broadcasters.
Mr. Goodell's four-hour testimony, in which he said Sunday Ticket was a premium product and had been priced accordingly, didn't win over the jurors. Before he flew to Sun Valley, Idaho, for Allen & Company's conference for media and technology leaders in July, the jury returned a $ 4.7 billion verdict against the league.
In an appearance on "Squawk Box" on CNBC during the conference, Mr. Goodell vowed to appeal. That became moot on Aug. 1, when Judge Philip Gutierrez threw the case out of U.S. District Court because, he said, the plaintiffs' expert witnesses had used flawed logic when determining damages.
That let the owners exhale, and Mr. Goodell could jet to the Paris Games without a crisis on his hands. N.F.L. commissioners don't often attend the Olympics, but because of Mr. Goodell's lobbying, flag football will be included for the first time in 2028 at the Los Angeles Games.
The league has been promoting flag football in part to persuade nervous parents to let their sons and daughters pick up the game. When Mr. Goodell took over as commissioner, stories about players suffering from long-term brain damage were front-page news. He has pushed for better equipment and rule changes to reduce dangerous plays like hits to the head, though the repetitive hits that have been linked to neurological and cognitive problems later in life are nearly impossible to remove from the game.
Some critics call flag football a gateway to tackle football. Even Mr. Goodell acknowledges that flag football is not without its risks. But every N.F.L. team now sponsors youth flag leagues. In July, the N.F.L. hosted a championship weekend in Canton, Ohio, where more than 2,000 athletes from around the world competed, and ESPN showed some of the games.
Peter O'Reilly, who runs events for the league, said sponsors like Toyota and Visa had attached their names to the tournament during a lull in the N.F.L. calendar. He said the event could move around the country, a formula that had worked well for the draft.
"Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if other cities or teams were interested in hosting at some of their team complexes," Mr. O'Reilly said.
Expanding the Global Footprint
To the N.F.L., flag football is another way to keep fans involved in the league. That has been its approach to sports betting as well. The league doesn't make money on the bets themselves, but it sells tens of millions of dollars in sponsorships to gambling companies like Draft Kings.
It also makes money selling its real-time statistical feeds, which will be integrated into streams that fans can personalize, something the league hopes will further increase viewership.
"I know people are focused on betting and gambling, but to me, it's just about engagement," said Steve Bornstein, who previously ran the league's media group and is now the president of North America for the sports technology company Genius Sports. "You have all this data. The trick is how do you use it."
Another frontier is overseas. With the U.S. market near saturation, the league has been expanding its footprint across the globe. In Week 1 of the current season, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers played in São Paulo, Brazil, the first N.F.L. game in South America and the 44th played on international soil since 2007. Global expansion is such a priority that Mr. Goodell flew to Brazil instead of to Kansas City, Mo., where the Super Bowl champion Chiefs hosted the season-opening game. (The Brazilian contest was streamed on Peacock.)
Not everyone is on board with the league's global push. Before heading out on a nine-hour flight to São Paulo, the Eagles cornerback Darius Slay Jr. questioned why the N.F.L. would play in a market where players had been told not to leave their hotels for their own safety.
"I'm like, N.F.L., why would you all want to send us somewhere where the crime rate is this high?" Mr. Slay said. "We're out of the country, and so the first thing we're thinking is something terrible could possibly happen."
But Mr. Goodell remains committed to the ambitious plan he outlined 14 years ago. He recently said the N.F.L. could play as many as 16 games a year overseas, up from five now, which could allow the league to create a new media-rights package -- and yet another huge payday for the N.F.L. owners and their expansionist commissioner.

A Democratic Leader Gets School Jobs, Despite Crime: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Democratic chairman of Hillside, N.J., is serving a six-month prison term. He got an $ 80,000 teaching job in the township after pleading guilty to tax fraud.
Anthony Salters, the powerful and well-connected chairman of the Democratic Party in Hillside, N.J., pleaded guilty in January to federal tax fraud. Three months later, Hillside's school district hired him for a newly created, $ 80,000 job teaching homebound students.
He was sentenced in August to six months in prison, federal records show. But that did not stop the school district from giving Mr. Salters, 62, a second job: club adviser at a middle school.
There is no possibility that the district was unaware Mr. Salters had admitted to willfully failing to file taxes; his criminal defense lawyer, Raymond Hamlin, is also the school board's lawyer.
Even in a state known for political patronage and corruption, the post-plea appointments to two taxpayer-funded jobs -- and Mr. Salter's continuing role as Hillside's Democratic leader despite being in prison -- are striking. And at a moment when New Jersey politics are at a crossroads, they highlight the challenge facing those seeking to upend the old ways of wielding power.
"People keep stealing our watch and telling us what time it is," said Dahlia Vertreese, Hillside's mayor.
It is not clear if Mr. Salters is being paid while in prison; district officials refused to respond to questions about his job status or salary history. But his post-conviction hiring demonstrated the degree to which political patronage can sideline sensible policy decisions.
Mr. Salters entered prison on Oct. 1, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons. He is expected to remain there through March, making it unclear how he could have been hired to fulfill a teaching or advising role during the current school year.
Ms. Vertreese, a Democrat, has openly opposed Mr. Salters's political influence in the 22,000-person township, 20 miles west of Manhattan. And residents of Hillside said the district's decision to hire Mr. Salters has exposed how a broken system permits political power brokers to operate with impunity.
Political corruption in New Jersey has been the dominant theme of the race to replace Robert Menendez, the state's former Democratic senator who was convicted in July of peddling his influence for bribes of gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz. Two lawsuits, including one filed by Representative Andy Kim, the Democratic nominee for the Senate seat, have upended a mainstay of party politics -- a ballot design known as "the line" -- that for decades has given leaders like Mr. Salters outsize power.
The practice allowed county leaders to give preferred candidates a prominent spot on primary ballots -- placement that studies have shown affords an often insurmountable advantage. A federal judge and an appeals court have deemed it unconstitutional.
"Time and again, New Jersey gives us examples of officeholders, candidates and party officials who do not have the best interests of voters and constituents at heart," said Brett Pugach, a lawyer involved in both federal suits. "Rather, they are selected either based on personal relationships or to fulfill the private interests of party leaders."
The school district's superintendent, Erskine Glover, and business administrator, David Eichenholtz, did not reply to emails, calls or a public records request for information about Mr. Salters. But three people familiar with Hillside's employment process, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear retribution, said Mr. Salters remains a district employee.
Mr. Hamlin said he was barred from discussing any employee's job status. He also instructed board of education members not to discuss the matter after they were contacted by a New York Times reporter.
Commenting on behalf of Mr. Salters and the school board, Mr. Hamlin did say there was nothing in New Jersey law to preclude Mr. Salters from continuing to work for Hillside -- or serving as its Democratic Party leader.
"Whatever public employment he may or may not have," Mr. Hamlin said, "there is no legal prohibition against him holding public employment."
Asked whether he expected Mr. Salters to step down as the township's Democratic chairman, he said, "I don't see why he would."
The leader of the Democratic Party in Union County, which includes Hillside, is no ordinary citizen.
Nicholas Scutari, a state senator, has been Union County's chairman since 2018. He held on to his county leadership role the next year with Mr. Salters's support, and in 2021 he became Senate president, making him one of three men in Trenton whose support is needed for most political appointments and all legislation.
Mr. Scutari said he was unaware that Mr. Salters was in prison.
As for the teaching position, he said, "If he's incarcerated, I think it would make it pretty difficult to do the job."
Ms. Vertreese, 47, was elected mayor in 2017 on a ticket backed by Mr. Salters, who each election cycle runs a slate of school board and council candidates. She said they soon parted ways.
Mr. Salters was charged with tax and wire fraud by the U.S. attorney's office in the District of New Jersey in 2020.
The next year, he helped to open a new school in Hillside with $ 2.4 million in state funds; the school's ribbon cutting drew Mr. Scutari and Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was campaigning for re-election.
Many serious crimes, including murder and sexual assault, would automatically disqualify a potential school employee from being hired, according to state law. Tax fraud is not on the list of disqualifying offenses, and a spokeswoman for the State Department of Education referred questions to the district, which has full control over hiring.
Mr. Murphy's spokesman said the governor did not believe Mr. Salters should be a paid school employee, or a Democratic chairman, while in prison.
Hillside students, the majority of whom are Black or Latino, lag behind their peers in much of the rest of Union County. Roughly 42 percent of students are proficient in English, and 18 percent are proficient in math, well below the statewide averages.
Ms. Vertreese said her efforts to publicize new recreation options for students have been blocked by Mr. Salters and his allies in the schools.
"People focus so much on the cities," she said. "But the majority of New Jersey are these little, small, tiny towns -- where no one is paying attention."

Europe Raises E.V. Tariffs On China, a Key Trade Ally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: European Union officials say the duties are meant to protect the region's automakers from what they say are unfair trade practices in China.
The European Union voted on Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, risking tensions with an important trading partner in an effort to protect an industry crucial to Europe's economy.
The decision affects billions of dollars of trade between two of the world's biggest economic powers. The move also reveals how the European Union is struggling to reconcile the conflicting interests of its members, some of whom see China as an essential partner while others view it as a dangerous competitor.
The tariffs are much lower than the 100 percent duties imposed by the United States and Canada, but analysts said they reflected Europe's willingness to build bridges with Washington by taking a tougher stance on Beijing, but without shutting out China entirely.
The vote sends "a signal that there's an emerging consensus in Europe that stronger pushback against China on the economic front is needed," said Noah Barkin, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund who specializes in Europe's relationship with China.
Still, the decision exposed the divisions among the 27 E.U. member states over how they should handle the issue with China. Five countries voted to block the tariffs, while 12 abstained.
The tariffs, which take effect on Oct. 31 and will last for five years, go as high as 45 percent. But both European and Chinese officials have said they remain in negotiations to reach an agreement that would address Brussels's concerns about unfair advantages enjoyed by automakers in China.
"The E.U. and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution," the European Commission said in a statement on Friday, adding that any deal would have to be within the rules set by the World Trade Organization. The vote stems from an investigation that the commission started last year into government subsidies given to electric vehicles made in China, part of a broader push against what the commission describes as anticompetitive behavior from China that has hurt European businesses.
The tariffs were calculated by the level of state support that Chinese automakers received from Beijing. The highest duties are being imposed on manufacturers that disclosed little about their subsidies, while Tesla, which has a large factory in Shanghai, was hit with the lowest because it negotiated with investigators.
China, which had lobbied individual countries to reject the tariffs, criticized the vote and called for the European Commission to postpone the duties while negotiations between the two sides continued. China is the European Union's second most important trading partner, after the United States. Last year, the two traded goods worth 739 billion euros, or $ 811 billion.
China's commerce ministry said the move represented "unfair, noncompliant and unreasonable protectionist practices." And the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said the lower prices of Chinese electric vehicles stemmed not from subsidies but from a supply chain that had developed through fierce market competition inside the country.
Talks will continue between Chinese and E.U. officials on Monday, a ministry spokesman said in the statement. He added a thinly veiled threat of retaliation if the tariffs were enacted, saying China would "take all measures to firmly safeguard the interests of Chinese companies."
China has already started investigations against subsidies on European goods, including dairy, brandy, pork and luxury cars.
European officials have said the tariffs could be paused or even ended should they reached an agreement with the Chinese that addressed their concerns about unfair advantages.
The Biden administration has voiced concerns that internet-connected Chinese cars and trucks pose a national security risk because their operating systems could send sensitive information to Beijing, but Europeans are more concerned about protecting their automotive industry. Last year, that industry provided 13.8 million jobs and accounted for 7 percent of the region's economic output.
In Germany, which voted against the tariffs, automakers and the government are concerned that the move could set off a trade war with China. Germany's three biggest automakers, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, are all heavily invested in China.
The decision by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany to vote "no" reflected the pressure that he faced from the country's leading autoworkers union, as well as from industry leaders, who warned that increased duties could harm competition when overall demand for cars, including electric vehicles, in Europe was shrinking and production costs in Germany remained stubbornly high.
"It is the right signal from the German government, which -- with a view to the economy, prosperity and growth -- has backed the interests of the European and German automotive industry and its employees on such an important issue," said Hildegard Müller, the president of the German Automobile Association. Hungary, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia also voted against the tariffs.
The European Union faces a shrinking share of the global economy and is lagging far behind the United States and China. A report published last month by Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, found that Europe needed to prioritize protecting its automotive plants and companies from state-subsidized foreign producers. Tariffs would "help level the playing field" while keeping Europe open to benefiting from productivity gains from China, according to the report, which was the result of a yearlong study requested by the European Commission on the causes of Europe's competitiveness crisis.
The 12 abstaining E.U. countries included Austria, Sweden and Spain, according to a European diplomat.
Carlos Cuerpo, Spain's economy minister, in a letter sent on Thursday to Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission's trade commissioner, called on the commission to continue negotiations with China. He wrote that the European Union needed to protect its automotive industry while avoiding an escalation of tensions with major trading partners like China, according to a European official who had seen a copy of the letter.
Others argue the tariffs will encourage the Chinese companies to shift their production to Europe, creating jobs and bringing their expertise to the continent. Two Chinese companies, Chery and Leapmotor, have already set up joint ventures with automakers in Europe, and BYD, China's leading automaker, is building its first factory in Europe.
But leaning too heavily on China to help prop up European industrial production could prove counterproductive in the long run, said Janka Oertel, the director of Asia for the European Council on Foreign Relations.
"Reindustrializing with the help of Chinese companies may seem like an easy fix to some in Rome or Madrid, but would further enhance dependence on Beijing and ability to strong-arm the European political process," she said.

BERLIN — The European Union voted Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, risking tensions with an important trading partner in an effort to protect an industry crucial to Europe’s economy.
The decision affects billions of dollars of trade between two of the world’s biggest economic powers. The move also reveals how the EU is struggling to reconcile the conflicting interests of its members, some of whom see China as an essential partner while others view it as a dangerous competitor.
The tariffs are much lower than the 100% duties imposed by the United States and Canada, but analysts said they reflected Europe’s willingness to build bridges with Washington by taking a tougher stance on China, but without shutting out Beijing entirely.
The vote sends “a signal that there’s an emerging consensus in Europe that stronger pushback against China on the economic front is needed,” said Noah Barkin, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund who specializes in Europe’s relationship with China.
Still, the decision exposed the divisions among the 27 EU member states over how they should handle the issue with China. Five countries voted to block the tariffs, while 12 abstained.
The tariffs, which take effect Oct. 31 and will last for five years, go as high as 45%. But both European and Chinese officials have said they remain in negotiations to reach an agreement that would address Brussels’ concerns about unfair advantages enjoyed by automakers in China.
“The EU and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution,” the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said in a statement Friday, adding that any deal would have to be within the rules set by the World Trade Organization.
The vote stems from an investigation that the commission started last year into government subsidies given to electric vehicles made in China, part of a broader push against what the commission describes as anticompetitive behavior from China that has hurt European businesses.
The tariffs were calculated by the level of state support that Chinese automakers received from Beijing. The highest duties are being imposed on manufacturers that disclosed little about their subsidies, while Tesla, which has a large factory in Shanghai, was hit with the lowest because it negotiated with investigators.
China, which had lobbied individual countries to reject the tariffs, criticized the vote and called for the European Commission to postpone the duties while negotiations between the two sides continued. China is the EU’s second most important trading partner, after the United States. Last year, the two traded goods worth 739 billion euros ($811 billion).
China’s Commerce Ministry said the move represented “unfair, noncompliant and unreasonable protectionist practices.” And the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said the lower prices of Chinese electric vehicles stemmed not from subsidies, but from a supply chain that had developed through fierce market competition inside the country.
Talks will continue between Chinese and EU officials Monday, a ministry spokesperson said in the statement. He added a thinly veiled threat of retaliation if the tariffs were enacted, saying China would “take all measures to firmly safeguard the interests of Chinese companies.”
China has already started investigations against subsidies on European goods, including dairy, brandy, pork and luxury cars.
European officials have said the tariffs could be paused or even ended should they reach an agreement with the Chinese that addresses their concerns about unfair advantages.
The Biden administration has voiced concerns that internet-connected Chinese cars and trucks pose a national security risk because their operating systems could send sensitive information to Beijing, but Europeans are more concerned about protecting their automotive industry. Last year, that industry provided 13.8 million jobs and accounted for 7% of the region’s economic output.
In Germany, which voted against the tariffs, automakers and the government are concerned that the move could set off a trade war with China. Germany’s three biggest automakers, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, are all heavily invested in China.
The decision by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany to vote “no” reflected the pressure he faced from the country’s leading autoworkers union, as well as from industry leaders, who warned that increased duties could harm competition when overall demand for cars, including electric vehicles, in Europe was shrinking and production costs in Germany remained stubbornly high.
“It is the right signal from the German government, which — with a view to the economy, prosperity and growth — has backed the interests of the European and German automotive industry and its employees on such an important issue,” said Hildegard Müller, the president of the German Automobile Association. Hungary, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia also voted against the tariffs.
The EU faces a shrinking share of the global economy and is lagging far behind the United States and China. A report published last month by Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, found that Europe needed to prioritize protecting its automotive plants and companies from state-subsidized foreign producers. Tariffs would “help level the playing field” while keeping Europe open to benefiting from productivity gains from China, according to the report, which was the result of a yearlong study requested by the European Commission on the causes of Europe’s competitiveness crisis.
The 12 abstaining EU countries included Austria, Sweden and Spain, according to a European diplomat.
Carlos Cuerpo, Spain’s economy minister, in a letter sent Thursday to Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission’s trade commissioner, called on the commission to continue negotiations with China. He wrote that the EU needed to protect its automotive industry while avoiding an escalation of tensions with major trading partners like China, according to a European official who had seen a copy of the letter.

European Union Likely to Clear Boost in Tariffs On China E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union is expected to support wielding tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, seeking to prevent unfair competition.
European countries are expected on Friday to approve an increase in tariffs to as much as 45 percent on electric cars imported from China, a move that officials said would help protect European carmakers from a glut of cheaper vehicles subsidized by Beijing.
The vote, by the 27 countries in the European Union, will impose additional tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla cars made in China to 35.3 percent for vehicles made by the Chinese automaker SAIC, with duties for other automakers falling somewhere in between. Those rates will come on top of the European Union's existing 10 percent tariffs on all imported cars.
Leaders in Brussels say the duties are aimed at creating a level playing field for automakers in Europe and their competitors in China, rather than to close the European Union market to Chinese imports.
But European countries are divided on the issue. France, Italy and Poland support the tariffs, while Germany remains opposed. Spain initially supported them but on a visit to China last month, the country's prime minister urged Brussels to consider a compromise.
To block the tariffs, 15 countries whose populations amount to 65 percent of the European Union's total inhabitants would need to vote against them.
Chinese leaders have spent recent weeks traveling through Europe's capitals, meeting with leaders from member countries and representatives in Brussels to try to reach an agreement that would prevent the tariffs from taking effect. European leaders said that although they were legally required to vote on the tariffs, they remained open to continuing talks on the issue with China.
The additional tariffs stem from an E.U. investigation into government subsidies given to electric vehicles made in China. The European Commission has indicated that it is open to continuing negotiations with China even after the vote, and the tariffs could be dropped, even after they have taken effect, should the two sides reach an agreement.
"The conclusions of the investigation is not necessarily the end of consultations on finding a solution," Martin Lucas, the commission's director-general in charge of trade defense, told the European Parliament on Monday.
The duties, which would come into effect on Oct. 31 and remain for five years, would still be significantly lower than the 100 percent tariffs imposed by the United States, Canada or Turkey.
President Emmanuel Macron of France has pushed his country's backing of the tariffs, insisting on Wednesday that the level of support that the Chinese automakers received from the state was "unbearable" and harmful to the European market.
"Broadly, we have to protect the level playing field in all the different sectors of our industry," he said.
Among those countries opposed to the tariffs is Germany, whose automakers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are all heavily invested in China, is concerned that the Chinese will retaliate against the tariffs.
"That is why negotiations with China on electric vehicles must continue," Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said in Berlin on Wednesday. He suggested the European Union look at other areas where Chinese competition was hurting Europeans, such as steel.
The automotive sector is crucial to Europe, employing 13.8 million people and accounting for 7 percent of the overall E.U. economic output. But sales have been falling, along with demand, leading manufacturers to consider layoffs and factory closures from Belgium to Germany to Italy.
Despite weaker overall demand for electric cars in Europe, China is taking a larger share of the market. Registration among owners of electric vehicles built in China has increased sevenfold in the past three years, according to the European Commission.
But some analysts point out that concerns about a tit-for-tat trade conflict with China were overblown, citing China's growing dependence on Europe.
"China really needs the European market, especially with the U.S. market closing down to Chinese products," said Noah Barkin, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. "China is going to respond if the E.U. introduces duties, but I doubt whether that response will be an over the top response."

Could Republicans Gain New Jersey Senate Seat?: [National Desk]

Full text: Curtis Bashaw, a hotel owner, is competing to represent New Jersey in the U.S. Senate against Andy Kim, a Democratic congressman.
Curtis Bashaw maneuvers his lanky body through a maze of picnic tables, stopping every few steps to repeat his upbeat introductory pitch to voters waiting for lunch on a recent weekday.
He is a Republican running to represent New Jersey in the U.S. Senate, he tells groups of graying attendees at Bergen County's annual senior festival. A fiscal conservative, he adds. A hotel owner from Cape May, N.J. A gay, married man.
"I don't think government should tell us what to do in our own homes," he says, bending down on one knee to be heard above music coming from a nearby stage.
He has positioned himself as a moderate competing for a seat vacated in spectacular fashion by the state's longtime Democratic senator, Robert Menendez, who was convicted of peddling his political influence in exchange for cash, gold and a Mercedes-Benz. Mr. Bashaw, 64, beat a candidate endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump to win the Republican nomination, and his showing in November will be a measure of his party's appeal to centrist voters at a time of heightened polarization.
New Jersey has teetered between political parties when selecting governors. But it has been 52 years since voters elected a Republican senator, and both Mr. Bashaw and his closest supporters acknowledge that his road to victory is narrow.
"I don't mind being stealth," he says.
With the race for president at a fever pitch, turnout is expected to be robust, a factor that in New Jersey benefits Democrats, whose voters outnumber Republicans by 930,000. Mr. Bashaw has chipped in $ 1.8 million to his campaign, yet as of July 1 had $ 3 million less to spend than his Democratic opponent, Representative Andy Kim, who unveiled his first television ad last week and said he planned to be on the air through Election Day.
Last month, the state's main gay rights organization, Garden State Equality, endorsed Mr. Kim. "If they're about equality for gays -- I'm gay," Mr. Bashaw said, sounding exasperated.
He has assembled a formidable team. His main political adviser, Mike DuHaime, twice helped lead former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, to victory. Jeanette Hoffman, his communications director, is a former executive director of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump's former campaign manager, came on as a strategist in July.
One independent poll soon after the primary found Mr. Kim, a third-term congressman, ahead by seven points. A survey commissioned by the Bashaw campaign two months later found that he had narrowed the gap and was behind Mr. Kim by five points, within the poll's margin of error.
It has been an extraordinarily volatile campaign cycle that has already reshaped politics in New Jersey.
"It's interesting that this race is flying under the radar since it has shaken up the political power structure in such a significant way," said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.
The political intrigue in New Jersey spiked last September when Mr. Menendez was indicted, in New York, on corruption charges. The governor's wife, Tammy Murphy, made a play for Mr. Menendez's seat. That led her main opponent, Mr. Kim, to file a federal lawsuit challenging a practice that for decades has given preferential spots on primary ballots to candidates favored by the state's powerful county political leaders.
Ms. Murphy, battered by accusations of nepotism, dropped out of the race. Mr. Kim won his legal challenge, upending a central pillar of party politics in New Jersey. Two of New Jersey's 12 House members died after lengthy hospitalizations. And a jury convicted Mr. Menendez of taking bribes and acting as an agent of Egypt.
Yet until August, Mr. Menendez, 70, was still toying with seeking re-election as an independent -- a strategy that Democrats struggling to retain a narrow majority in the Senate feared could siphon enough votes from Mr. Kim to benefit Mr. Bashaw.
That worry vanished when Mr. Menendez quit the Senate and pulled his name off the ballot hours before the deadline. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 29.
Mr. Bashaw, a first-time candidate, owns and operates coastal hotels on Long Island and at the southernmost tip of New Jersey in Cape May, where he renovated Congress Hall, a resort that dates to the 19th century and has long been a magnet for politicians from Trenton to Washington. He was appointed by Jim McGreevey, then the Democratic governor, to run the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority in Atlantic City, N.J., in 2004, a post he held for about two years that involved managing land use and trying to lure private investment to the seaside city.
Mr. Bashaw has been endorsed by several police unions and said he believed that Mr. Menendez's trial and the first lady's campaign had left enough of a taint on Democrats to help him make his case to voters.
"The stench of Menendez's corruption hangs in the air," he said. "The inside baseball of Tammy Murphy's campaign is in the air."
He cited the porous southern border and government regulation as issues he would tackle in Washington. He has criticized Mr. Kim for calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and has stressed Israel's right to defend itself.
He said he supports abortion rights, but has also repeatedly said that the Supreme Court got it right when it overturned Roe v. Wade, ending a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy, because it returned decision-making to the states. Mr. Bashaw said that if elected, he would support bipartisan federal legislation to make abortion legal nationwide, but declined to say until what point in a pregnancy he believed it should be allowed.
Mr. Kim said he was baffled by his opponent's position. "For him, the only thing 'pro-choice' means is the choice for legislators to make decisions about women's bodies," said Mr. Kim, a member of the Pro-Choice Caucus in Washington who opposed the end of Roe.
Mr. Bashaw, who during the primary waited for months to say he supported Mr. Trump, said the former president has his vote. "I'm going to vote for President Trump, in this race, at this point," Mr. Bashaw said.
State Senator Michael L. Testa Jr., a right-leaning Republican who is chairman of Mr. Bashaw's campaign, said Mr. Bashaw must appeal to the state's 2.4 million so-called unaffiliated voters, who are not registered with either major party and whose support Republicans need to win statewide elections.
"There's a narrow pathway," Mr. Testa said from a coffee shop at Congress Hall. "If he executes his plan and it's authentic, he can attract voters to the Republican Party who haven't been voting with the party."
People like Joanne Russo.
Ms. Russo, 68, an unaffiliated voter from Bogota, N.J., stopped Mr. Bashaw abruptly as he was campaigning in Paramus. "You've got to win," she told him. "You have no choice."
In an interview, she said she believed that the Democrats' grip on both U.S. Senate seats, the governor's mansion and both houses of the State Legislature had left New Jersey without a healthy system of checks and balances.
"New Jersey is in the Democratic bag," Ms. Russo said. "I feel like, 'Why vote?"'
Mr. Kim, 42, represents a largely rural and suburban district in southern and central New Jersey and is less well known in the more populous urban centers close to New York City, where he has been campaigning hard since jumping into the race the day after Mr. Menendez was indicted. Three debates between Mr. Bashaw and Mr. Kim are planned this month.
Democrats control the Senate, 51 to 49, and are fighting to protect seats in hotly contested races in Michigan, Montana and Ohio. Losing New Jersey, ranked by the Cook Political Report as solidly Democratic, would be a major upset.
Even Mr. Bashaw's allies in Cape May, who are quick to praise his business acumen, say they are concerned that, if elected, he would have little choice but to fall in line with the conservative wing of the Republican Party, particularly if Mr. Trump wins the presidency.
"I always swear he's the smartest guy in the room," said Tom Carroll, who with his wife led Cape May's revival as a bed-and-breakfast destination and has worked closely with Mr. Bashaw on historic preservation and business improvement efforts in the small city.
"As much as I like Curtis," added Mr. Carroll, a Democrat, "I'm not really happy with him being a catch for the Republican Party and Trump."

In Istanbul, Testing Eric Adams's Upgrade Life: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Life is grand in the Bentley Suite at the St. Regis Istanbul, with its marble floors and walk-in closet, its 24-hour butler service, and its views stretching all the way to the blue waters of the Bosporus.
The light sculpture suspended above the vast bed, where New York Mayor Eric Adams slept in 2017, is said to evoke the undulations of the Nürburgring racetrack in Germany. The complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries on the coffee table are dusted with crushed pistachios and nestled on a bed of delicately crumbled cookies. The curved leather sofa has two built-in Champagne coolers that light up and open at the press of a button.
If you were to think about New York City (but why would you?) while reclining on your private balcony and gazing at the Gucci store across the street, you might be struck by the notion that the suite is roughly three times the size of your first apartment.
The Bentley, whose spectacular leather, chrome and lacquer décor was designed in concert with the luxury car manufacturer and inspired by the interior of a Bentley Continental GT, usually costs about $ 2,500 a night. Mr. Adams is said to have paid just $ 300. The rest of his tab was picked up by the hotel.
Last week, the mayor was accused in a federal indictment of corruptly accepting more than $ 100,000 in illegal gifts, including expensive airline seats and stays in hotels, in exchange for using his political influence to help Turkey. He pleaded not guilty to five felony counts on Friday.
In the 57-page indictment, federal prosecutors portrayed Mr. Adams as a man who, after enjoying a few travel-related upgrades early in his political career, developed a hunger for and expectation of luxury travel that grew increasingly feverish and detail-oriented over the years.
Doling out upgrades is not unusual in the travel industry, where special perks are seen as a strategic way to curry favor with influential people. What stands out, according to the indictment, is the ardor of Mr. Adams's efforts to capitalize on his Turkish connections in order to travel in style, not only when he visited Turkey but also when he insisted on using its national airline to travel to places like Ghana, China and India. Also notable is the blatant nature of the political favors that the mayor is charged with bestowing in return.
This weekend, a photographer for The New York Times, Clark Hodgin, and I retraced one of Mr. Adams's trips to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, long the mayor's carrier of choice. We, too, enjoyed not thinking about our wearisome responsibilities back home and not having to use our own money while on this rarefied assignment. I also got to spend a night in the Bentley Suite.
The Times paid $ 9,236.90 for my round-trip ticket, tax included, and the benefits began not in the air, but in the (small, in the scheme of things) Turkish Airlines lounge in Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport. On Friday, it was offering typical lounge fare: a breakfast buffet of eggs and other hot entrees, as well as platters of cheese, charcuterie and tiny cakes.
None of the other customers seemed interested in discussing Mr. Adams and what he may or may not have done, perhaps because it was only 5:30 a.m. Still, the mayor's presence seemed to shimmer invisibly in the air.
For one thing, his enormous image could be seen looming from the TV screen, illustrating a report on CBS about his legal woes and their connections to Turkish Airlines. Also, in a strange turn of events, the lounge's Wi-Fi password turned out to be TKNYCADAMS.
That was merely an odd coincidence, according to the attendant at the front desk, who said that the lounge was operated by a company called Adams International and that its proprietor was a man named John Adams.
Flying business class on Turkish Airlines was a lovely experience, as flying business class always is. My joy at being allotted a seat in this happy area for the 10-hour flight was enhanced by my feelings of schadenfreude-infused sympathy for Clark. Though he flew on the same flight, he had bought his ticket too late and thus was stuck back in economy -- the exact place Mr. Adams had not wanted to be. (Clark's ticket cost The Times $ 2,289.90.) I felt sorry for him, wedged into his cramped seat with no one catering to his every whim, but not sorry enough to offer to switch places.
Up front, it was far too easy to get used to it all. The way the attendants made up our seats with special bedding, so we would be spared the burden of having to make direct contact with the actual seat fabric. The way the seats then stretched out into fully flat beds. The way dinner was preceded by a trolley full of appetizers -- an eggplant mélange, hummus, boiled shrimp and falafel, among other things -- mixed and matched at our seats by an attendant wearing a chef's toque and apron.
The snack bar set up in the front of the cabin was replenished throughout the flight. Battery-operated candles were lovingly placed on our trays in tiny paper bags printed with the words "candlelight dinner high above the clouds." The man sitting next to me was served two whiskeys before breakfast even arrived.
Let us stipulate that while all of this was pretty great, the high-end travel the mayor is said to have improperly accepted wasn't at the highest level possible. He didn't fly first class, for instance (possibly because Turkish Airlines doesn't have one). Meanwhile, while the airline's business class took the top award for its food service in the 2024 Skytrax World Airlines Awards rankings of airlines' business classes, it came just 10th in overall quality.
And while the 1,345-square foot Bentley Suite is considered one of the most luxe accommodations at the St. Regis, it's not as luxe as the Presidential Suite, which has two bedrooms, not one. Nor is the hotel arguably the grandest in Istanbul. Mr. Adams is said to have planned to stay in one of the city's two Four Seasons properties for a nominal fee on another trip in 2021 that would also have included "a yacht tour, a three-day stay at a luxury beach resort, and a car and driver," according to the indictment. (Alas, he canceled the trip at the last minute.)
Mr. Adams has not been said to have accepted free rides on anyone's private jet (hello, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas) or convicted of amassing solid gold bars, cash and a luxury Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible in a bribery scheme benefiting Egypt, as recently happened to Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
Yet it's hard not to read the story of Mr. Adams and his trips as a cautionary tale about the perils of accepting free luxury anything, especially if you're a politician obliged to fill out pesky financial disclosure forms. It may indeed be better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, but not when it comes to travel. Once you've been in the front of a plane or stayed in one of the best rooms at a five-star hotel, it's disproportionately painful to be sent back to economy or forced to return once again to a Studio Suite at the Residence Inn.
Cenk Öcal, who as general manager of Turkish Airlines in New York was said in the indictment to have served as the point person for Mr. Adams's numerous seat-upgrade requests, seems to have understood this all too well, dangling business-class seats in front of the mayor as both carrot and stick. After Mr. Adams was elected mayor, Mr. Öcal began angling for a spot on his transition committee.
"It would suit me well to be lead Or Senior Advisor," Mr. Öcal wrote in a text to an Adams staffer, according to the indictment.
"Lead Plz :)," he later texted, and then added -- deploying perhaps the most horrifying generic threat imaginable to someone terrified of being relegated to the back of the plane -- "Otherwise seat number 52 is empty."

Amazon's A.I. Deal Cleared by Watchdog
Britain's competition watchdog said Friday that it's clearing Amazon's partnership with artificial intelligence company Anthropic because the $ 4 billion deal didn't qualify for further scrutiny.
The Competition and Markets Authority approval comes after it started looking into the deal, part of wider global scrutiny for investments from Big Tech companies into leading startups working on generative AI technology.
The watchdog found that San Francisco-based Anthropic's revenue and its combined market share with Amazon in Britain were not big enough to require an in-depth investigation under the country's merger rules.
"We welcome the UK's Competition and Markets Authority decision acknowledging its lack of jurisdiction regarding this collaboration," Amazon said in a statement. "By investing in Anthropic, we're helping to spur entry and competition in generative AI."

Leading Contender to Buy Citgo Petroleum Emerges
Elliott Investment Management was named on Friday as the leading contender to acquire Citgo Petroleum, the oil refining giant that has been the subject of a long legal battle over billions of dollars the government of Venezuela owes foreign businesses, including U.S. energy companies.
A special master appointed to oversee the sale of Citgo said in a federal court filing that he recommended the company be sold to an affiliate of Elliott, Amber Energy. A federal judge would have to approve the deal, which values Citgo at up to $ 7.3 billion, including debt.
Citgo's main assets are three refineries in Illinois, Louisiana and Texas that together account for roughly 4 percent of the country's fuel-making capacity.
The sale is unlikely to directly affect operations at more than 4,000 independently owned gas stations that use the Citgo brand as franchisees.

Volkswagen Downgrades Annual Forecast Again
Volkswagen cut its annual outlook for the second time in less than three months on Friday, citing a weaker-than-expected performance at its passenger car division as pressure on Europe's top automaker continues to rise.
The lowered outlook is the latest from Germany's car giants, with Mercedes-Benz and BMW both downgrading their annual forecasts earlier this month as a result of weakening demand in China, the world's biggest car market.
It also comes two days after Volkswagen kicked off crucial talks with IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, over pay and job protection, a historic conflict that could lead to the first German factory closures in the carmaker's history.
Volkswagen now expects a profit margin of around 5.6 percent in 2024, down from 6.5-7 percent previously and below the 6.5 percent LSEG estimate. REUTERS

Foiling Tariff By Building Cars in E.U.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: BYD, which leads China's electric vehicle sector, is constructing a plant in Hungary while its Chinese rivals expand through joint ventures in Europe.
The leafy city of Szeged, Hungary, boasting wide avenues, a respected university and ornate, pale yellow villas near the country's border with Serbia, looks more like a relic of the Hapsburg empire than the location of Europe's automotive future.
But at a 740-acre construction site here, excavators have already begun preparing for what will be the first European assembly plant of China's leading automaker, BYD. Large concrete pipes and stacks of metal sheets stand ready, with the cornerstone to be set this fall.
Timing is crucial. The European Union is poised to decide by Oct. 30 whether to increase tariffs on electric vehicles entering the bloc from China. The duties, on top of an existing 10 percent tariff, would range from 9 to 35.3 percent and remain in effect for five years. They are significantly lower than the 100 percent tariffs imposed by the United States and Canada, but they come as Chinese automakers are eager to break into the European market.
BYD has already been seeking to raise its profile in Europe, working with distributors across 19 countries to offer electric and hybrid models and sponsoring the European Championship soccer tournament this summer.
"They have very ambitious plans," Sandor Nagy, a deputy mayor responsible for urban development in Szeged, said of BYD's plant, which the company plans to bring online next year. "And they obviously have a very strong incentive with the tariffs."
Other Chinese automakers, eager to convince Europeans that their cars are fun to drive and more affordable than models made by European companies, are also looking for ways to avoid the tariffs.
Chery, a Chinese car manufacturer, announced in April that it would begin producing electric vehicles in Barcelona, Spain, in partnership with Ebro EV Motors. Stellantis, whose European brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Opel, announced in May that it was entering into a partnership with Leapmotor of China, with production of electric vehicles in Europe to begin this fall.
Zhejiang Geely Holding, which acquired the Swedish automaker Volvo Cars in 2010, is also scouting for a possible production site in Europe. It owns Polestar, which is based in Sweden but produces its vehicles in China. This year, the company began making a sport utility vehicle at a plant in South Carolina, which will also be used to supply the European market.
The moves into Europe come as deliberations about the tariffs head into their final weeks. Wang Wentao, China's minister of commerce, is touring European capitals ahead of a meeting on Thursday in Brussels with Valdis Dombrovskis, the E.U. commissioner for trade.
E.U. officials worry that China poses a threat to Europe's auto industry, which accounts for nearly 7 percent of the region's economic output. They say Beijing has not offered a solution that sufficiently addresses their concerns that years of government support have granted Chinese automakers an unfair advantage over their European peers.
Analysts believe that shifting production closer to the market will benefit both sides: The European auto industry would gain jobs and access to cutting-edge technology, while Chinese producers would save on tariffs and shipping costs.
"I don't think it makes corporate sense from simply a profitability point of view to think you can supply the global car market from factories in China," said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Chinese brands accounted for 3.7 percent of all electric vehicles sold in Europe in 2023, compared with 0.4 percent of market share four years earlier. That number is expected to climb in the next five years.
In July, Turkey announced that BYD would build an assembly plant there, with production of battery-powered and hybrid cars to begin in 2026. Turkey is not an E.U. member, but trade agreements mean that cars made there would not be subject to the tariffs.
In Szeged, BYD is aiming to ramp up production over the next few years, creating thousands of new jobs. The speed is part of a push to get its cars onto the European market, despite the recent slump in demand.
Already the company has been working to make itself known across Europe, setting up relationships with dealers. At the European soccer championship in Germany, BYD displayed its cars at fan fairs in 10 cities, and its logo flashed on the sideboards throughout the matches.
Germany is Europe's largest economy and its largest market for cars. But it also holds a special prestige for China. Germany's top automakers -- Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- helped to develop the auto industry there through joint ventures formed with Chinese companies in the early 1990s.
But German consumers are traditionally conservative and deeply loyal to their brands. Berlin's decision to abruptly cut subsidies toward the purchase of electric vehicles led to a nearly 37 percent drop in new registrations in the year through July, compared with the same time in the previous year.
That has not stopped Chinese automakers from trying to gain a toehold. Last week, several Chinese car manufacturers displayed their latest models at a trade fair in Frankfurt that is normally focused on automotive suppliers.
"Even if some in Europe turn against us, we will never turn against the European market," Victor Yang, senior vice president at Geely, told reporters at the fair.
The interest in Europe is not just from automakers. More Chinese suppliers have arrived over the past several years to be closer to the assembly plants that purchase their products, said Maarten Otte, the head of investor relations for Central and Eastern Europe at CTP, a logistics and industrial real estate firm.
Automakers such as BMW that rely on parts made by Chinese companies are concerned about the costs and the risks associated with shipping goods overseas and are looking to make their supply chains more affordable and secure, he said.
"So they say, 'If you want to produce for our European market, you need to be in Europe,"' Mr. Otte said. A combination of skilled workers available at lower wages and the availability of undeveloped land has made countries in Central and Eastern Europe especially interesting, he said.
The Hungarian government of Viktor Orban has pledged incentives to support the project but has not yet disclosed the amount. BYD did not respond to a request for comment.
Some analysts have drawn parallels between the situation playing out in Europe and Washington's approach to Toyota and Honda, Japanese brands that invested heavily in production in the United States in the 1980s.
But despite attempts to shift the relationship from cooperation to competition, China remains Europe's second-largest trading partner, after the United States, with bilateral trade worth 739 billion euros, or $ 814 billion, in 2023.
"All of these things combined produce an overall political situation where the national security-driven U.S. approach is certainly not desirable in Europe," said Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute.
This is especially true in Germany, where automakers are heavily invested in China and, fearful of endangering their interests there, oppose the tariffs.
And during a visit to China last week, Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain -- Europe's second-largest car manufacturer -- urged Brussels to reconsider its position, arguing that pursuing the tariffs would be harmful.
"We don't need another war, in this case a trade war," Mr. Sánchez said. "I think we need to build bridges between the European Union and China."

All G.M. Electric Vehicles Gain Access to Tesla's Network of Chargers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a delay of several months, General Motors said owners of its battery-powered models would now be able to use Tesla charging stations with adapters.
Owners of electric cars and pickup trucks made by General Motors will be able to use Tesla's extensive charging network starting on Wednesday, a potential boost for slowing electric vehicle sales.
G.M. said it would begin selling adapters allowing owners of Chevrolet Bolts, GMC Hummers, Cadillac Lyriqs and other electric models from the company to charge at Tesla Supercharger stations.
Access to the network could encourage people to buy electric cars by alleviating fears about finding reliable places to charge them. Tesla's fast-charging network is the largest in the United States and is widely considered by analysts and drivers to be the most reliable.
With limited exceptions, those chargers were open only to Tesla cars until last year when the company, led by Elon Musk, agreed to allow access to other models. Virtually all manufacturers of electric vehicles have since agreed to switch to the charging technology developed by Tesla, which uses a proprietary plug.
G.M. had said its cars would be able to use Tesla chargers several months ago, but until Wednesday, only the owners of Ford and Rivian vehicles had gained access to the network. Cars from other automakers like Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are expected to be next, though the timing is unclear. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
A shortage of adapters has also limited the number of drivers who can use the system. The adapters are an interim solution until other automakers begin manufacturing cars designed to accept the plugs used by Teslas.
The delays in gaining access to Tesla's chargers have raised questions about whether other automakers erred by agreeing to switch to the company's network, making them dependent on Mr. Musk, who is known for impulsive decision making. The company manufactures adapters at a factory in Buffalo, N.Y., but was not producing them fast enough to meet demand.
G.M. said on Wednesday that it would buy adapters from several suppliers, rather than relying solely on Tesla. G.M. will sell the adapters for $ 225, in contrast to Ford and Rivian, which are buying them from Tesla and offering them to their customers at no cost. Drivers in the United States will get the adapters first, followed by Canadian customers later this year.
One factor probably contributing to delays was Mr. Musk's decision in April to dismiss nearly all of the 500 Tesla employees responsible for the Supercharger network. The company's construction of new chargers plunged afterward, but it surged again in August after some of the fired employees were rehired.
Tesla installed 617 new fast-charging ports last month, more than all other charging companies combined, according to EVAdoption, a research firm. Still, installations are down about 10 percent from 2023. A fast charger can replenish a depleted car battery in 20 minutes to an hour depending on the capabilities of the charger and the car.
G.M. said it was working with other partners to increase the amount of charging stations, which remains inadequate for the number of electric vehicles on the road.
"G.M.'s ongoing efforts to help accelerate the expansion of public charging infrastructure is an integral part of our commitment to an all-electric future," Wade Sheffer, vice president of G.M. Energy, said in a statement.
All electric vehicles manufactured by G.M. will be able to use the adapters, the company said, although some versions of the Chevrolet Bolt will need free software updates, which will require their owners to take them to a dealer.
Not all of Tesla's network will be open to other car brands. The adapters will work with about 18,000 Tesla fast-charging ports in the United States, about 60 percent of the total. Older, less powerful Tesla chargers will remain inaccessible.
Tesla began building charging stations more than a decade ago when they were a rarity. Exclusive access to the network was a major selling point for Tesla cars.
In recent years, companies like Electrify America and EVgo have built thousands of chargers that are open to cars from all automakers.
By opening its network, Tesla can make money from a larger pool of drivers. But the company also risks angering buyers of its cars who may now have to wait longer for chargers to open up because Tesla stations are being used by many more vehicles.
The growth rate of electric vehicle sales has slowed sharply recently, though the pace is still faster than for sales of gasoline-powered cars. Along with other carmakers, G.M. has cut back investment in manufacturing facilities for electric vehicles, but the company's executives have said they still expect electric cars to gain ground over time.

Trump Rolls Out World Liberty Financial, a New Cryptocurrency Venture: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a livestream, Donald Trump formally introduced World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture led by two digital currency entrepreneurs with little experience running high-profile businesses.
A day after an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald J. Trump, he appeared on a livestream on Monday to champion his latest business venture: cryptocurrencies.
"Crypto is one of those things we have to do," Mr. Trump said on X. "Whether we like it or not, I have to do it."
Beside him were his collaborators, including a family friend; Mr. Trump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump; and two little-known crypto entrepreneurs with no experience running a high-profile business. Together, they were rolling out Mr. Trump's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, a project that has already raised concerns about the former president's conflicts of interest and even alarmed some of his most vocal supporters in the industry.
Mr. Trump has promoted the venture since August, but its exact purpose remains unclear. No official launch date has been set. On the livestream, he did not address the project directly, leaving the details to the two entrepreneurs, Chase Herro and Zachary Folkman. Mr. Herro has described himself as "the dirtbag of the internet," while Mr. Folkman used to teach classes on how to seduce women.
It's highly unusual for a presidential candidate to embark on a new business just weeks before Election Day, and even rarer for one to aggressively promote a venture designed to benefit himself and his family. But throughout his political career, Mr. Trump has engaged in business dealings that ethics experts have flagged as problematic. He is the majority owner of Trump Media & Technology Group, the publicly traded parent company of his social media platform, Truth Social, which accounts for some $ 2 billion of his personal wealth.
Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said that if Mr. Trump was elected in November, his involvement in the crypto venture would create serious conflicts of interest. The Securities and Exchange Commission has cracked down on the industry, arguing that nearly all cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities and ought to be regulated like stocks traded on Wall Street.
Mr. Trump "would be able to push regulatory agencies to favor businesses he is involved in," Ms. Brian said. Ethics experts have said that his ownership of the social media company raises similar issues.
Representatives for the Trump Organization and World Liberty Financial did not respond to requests for comment.
For years, Mr. Trump was a crypto skeptic who denounced Bitcoin as a "scam." But on the campaign trail, he has morphed into a vocal supporter, speaking at a popular industry conference and drawing donations from crypto executives. "You have a very hostile S.E.C.," Mr. Trump said on Monday. "My attitude is different."
Planning for World Liberty Financial began nine months ago, according to the Trump family friend involved in the venture, Steve Witkoff, a real estate magnate who helped spearhead it. On the livestream, Mr. Witkoff said he introduced Mr. Trump's sons to Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman, who have overseen the venture.
By July, AMG Software Solutions, a company based in Puerto Rico, had filed a trademark for the new platform. The next month, Mr. Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. started posting about it on X.
On the livestream on Monday, Mr. Trump and his sons said that crypto would transform the financial system, without detailing what their business venture is designed to accomplish. But privately, some people involved in World Liberty Financial have pitched it as a borrowing and lending platform, according to three people with knowledge of the project. A white paper for the venture, reviewed by The New York Times, said that it would feature a new cryptocurrency called $ WLFI that would be sold to the public.
On its official X and Telegram accounts, World Liberty Financial has said that the project aims to drive "mass adoption of stablecoins," a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value of $ 1. One person briefed on the project described it as similar to an existing service called Instadapp, an application that allows users to manage their investments across a range of crypto platforms.
Several members of the Trump family have roles in the business, according to a list of team members included in the white paper. Mr. Trump's title is "chief crypto advocate." Barron Trump, his 18-year-old son, is listed as the project's "DeFi visionary," a reference to the branch of crypto known as decentralized finance. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are each described as a "web3 ambassador."
A disclaimer at the end of the document said the platform wasn't owned or managed by Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization or his family, though family members might receive compensation. (The white paper was earlier reported by the crypto news outlet CoinDesk.)
Behind the scenes, Steve Witkoff has taken a hands-on role, according to a person familiar with the planning. He envisioned the project partly as a way to give Barron Trump some experience with entrepreneurship, the person said, and steer him away from memecoins, a scam-ridden segment of the crypto industry. A spokesman for Mr. Witkoff declined to comment.
Barron Trump did not participate in the livestream, but the former president described him as a crypto enthusiast. "He's got four wallets or something," Mr. Trump said. "He knows this stuff inside out."
The key figures in the project are Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman. On the livestream, Mr. Herro, who sometimes spells his surname Hero, said his aim was to give "the everyday American" access to crypto investments.
"This country's been so good to me, and crypto has been so good to me," Mr. Herro said.
Mr. Herro is a relatively obscure figure in the crypto world. As a young man, he has said, he was a habitual drug offender and was imprisoned, but later turned his life around and became rich. In 2022, he appeared at a crypto seminar hosted by Jordan Belfort, who inspired the 2013 movie "The Wolf of Wall Street." At the event, Mr. Herro described stablecoins as "the biggest innovation since sliced bread," and said his favorite of the coins was "vivacious and insane and almost borderline a Ponzi scheme."
Over the years, Mr. Herro has worked closely with Mr. Folkman, who founded a company called Date Hotter Girls, which offered seminars on "attracting, dating and keeping women of beauty and quality."
Mr. Folkman and Mr. Herro have pursued a range of business ventures together, first in the U.S. Virgin Islands and later in Puerto Rico. Both have homes in Puerto Rico, which has become a haven for crypto enthusiasts who were drawn by a generous tax break, according to public records. Mr. Folkman is listed in a government database as one of the thousands of people living in Puerto Rico who receive the tax break.
Before they set up shop in Puerto Rico, Mr. Folkman and Mr. Herro ran the Nexus Group, an internet advertising and media company in the U.S. Virgin Islands that received a similar business tax break. Mr. Herro also ran a separate crypto trading business there called Pacer Capital.
In the U.S. Virgin Islands, Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman worked with Alex Golubitsky, a lawyer listed in the white paper as World Liberty Financial's legal counsel.
In an email, Mr. Golubitsky said he could not discuss the crypto venture. But he referred to Mr. Herro and Mr. Folkman as "talented tech entrepreneurs."
On the livestream, Mr. Folkman said that lawyers were in the room with him, "staring daggers at me." Because of the government crackdown on crypto, he explained, the digital currency associated with World Liberty Financial would be available in the United States only to accredited investors.
"The lawyers are getting nervous back there," he said. "They're sweating."

G.M. and Hyundai Plan to Work Together on New Vehicles and Supply Chains: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: General Motors and the South Korean automaker say they will collaborate on new vehicles, buying parts and clean energy technologies.
General Motors and Hyundai said on Thursday that they would look for areas where they could collaborate on new vehicles, supply chains and technologies in a bid to cut costs and move faster.
The two automakers said they aimed to work together on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. But they did not provide details on where the joint work would be done, which executives would oversee the effort or how quickly they would come up with new models.
"G.M. and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams," Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said in a statement. "Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently."
The companies have signed a nonbinding agreement and said they would begin exploring possible areas of cooperation immediately.
Like other automakers, G.M. and Hyundai have invested tens of billions of dollars to develop electric vehicles that have so far fallen short of the lofty sales goals some executives had set. Consumer enthusiasm for battery-powered models has cooled in the past year, largely on concerns about the high prices of electric models and the challenges of charging them.
Sales of such cars and trucks are growing at a modest pace, though generally at a faster pace than for conventional gasoline vehicles. Many manufacturers, including Tesla, have cut prices to spur demand and are scrambling to reduce costs.
"This partnership will enable Hyundai Motor and G.M. to evaluate opportunities to enhance competitiveness in key markets and vehicle segments, as well as drive cost efficiencies and provide stronger customer value," Hyundai's group executive chair, Chung Eui-sun, said in a statement.
G.M. has been losing money on the electric models it makes but has said it expects those vehicles to become profitable by the end of the year. Ford Motor lost $ 2.5 billion on its electric vehicle business in the first half of this year, and has set up a development team in California to design models that are less costly to produce.
Automotive partnerships have had a mixed record of success, however. Several years ago, Ford invested in the electric vehicle start-up Rivian, but later decided to sell most of its shares. Ford also established a partnership with Volkswagen, but the companies have reduced their collaboration, and Volkswagen said this year that it would work with Rivian, mainly on software.
G.M. and Honda also formed a partnership to develop electric vehicles. Honda and its luxury brand, Acura, recently introduced two electric sport utility vehicles that are assembled at G.M. factories with G.M.'s battery technology. But the two companies have scrapped plans to work together on more models, and Honda has said it is solely developing its next slate of battery-powered models. Tesla has at different times worked with Toyota and Mercedes-Benz before shifting its strategy.

Former Chief Of VW Faces Fraud Trial Over Testing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Nine years after the carmaker admitted to concealing emissions on a massive scale, Martin Winterkorn will be tried in a German court.
Almost nine years after Volkswagen admitted that it had rigged millions of cars to cheat on emissions tests, the company's former chief executive went on trial Tuesday on charges stemming from the fraud, a vast corporate conspiracy that changed the auto industry.
Martin Winterkorn, 77, who led Volkswagen from 2007 until he resigned under pressure in September 2015, appeared at a court in Braunschweig, Germany, after a judge rejected his pleas to postpone the trial because he said he was in poor health. The trial will be a test of whether German authorities can hold top executives accountable for wrongdoing that cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars and contributed to poor air quality in Europe and the United States.
Mr. Winterkorn, who was once Germany's highest-paid executive, faces criminal charges including fraud, market manipulation and making false statements. Prosecutors accused him of failing to notify authorities and owners of Volkswagen cars when, in 2014, he became aware of software designed to illegally cloak emissions that exceeded limits imposed by European and U.S. regulators.
With Mr. Winterkorn's knowledge, prosecutors said, Volkswagen continued to sell such vehicles until the cheating was exposed by California regulators and the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015. Over a decade, Volkswagen and its Audi, Skoda and Seat units sold nine million cars with the illicit software.
Prosecutors have also accused Mr. Winterkorn of authorizing a recall of the affected vehicles in 2014 with the purpose of preventing regulators from learning about the forbidden software. And he is accused of lying under oath to a German parliamentary committee investigating the cheating.
The market manipulation charge arises from allegations that Mr. Winterkorn failed to notify Volkswagen shareholders of the financial risk posed by the software as required by securities law.
The trial started on Tuesday, with prosecutors reading all three indictments against Mr. Winterkorn, who arrived early wearing a dark blue suit. He looked tired as the charges were read, but his lead attorney, Felix Dörr, said Mr. Winterkorn was in good health.
The case illustrates how difficult and time-consuming it can be for prosecutors to hold high-ranking corporate managers accountable for illegal activity that takes place on their watch. Mr. Winterkorn, who was known for his authoritarian management style and short fuse, has insisted that he had no knowledge of the cheating, blaming underlings for the wrongdoing.
The trial comes at an inopportune time for Volkswagen, which faces profitability problems amid increasing pressure from Asian competitors. On Monday, the carmaker warned that it would consider closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, ending a decades-old guarantee of job security for workers.
The wheels of justice moved exceptionally slowly in Mr. Winterkorn's case. The trial was postponed repeatedly while he received treatment for knee and hip problems. But the court in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, rejected his most recent pleas to delay the proceedings.
The charges carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, although it is unusual for German judges to impose long prison sentences for white-collar crimes. Rupert Stadler, the former chief executive of Volkswagen's Audi unit, received a suspended sentence last year after he pleaded guilty to charges related to the scandal.
The illegal software that Volkswagen used recognized when a diesel vehicle's emissions system was being tested and dialed up pollution controls to comply with regulations.
At other times, the cars spewed excessive quantities of toxic nitrogen oxides, which cause asthma and other respiratory problems. The engines' emissions systems were not capable of consistently operating within legal limits.
The scandal has had long-lasting effects on the auto industry. Volkswagen and other carmakers had, for years, marketed cars that ran on diesel as cleaner alternatives to gasoline cars. They argued that diesel cars had better fuel economy, and therefore emitted less greenhouse gases.
Few people listened to environmental activists who pointed out that pollution levels in European cities were much higher than they should have been if the technology was as clean as advertised.
Volkswagen's wrongdoing, which was initially uncovered by graduate students at West Virginia University working with a $ 70,000 grant, exposed the degree to which the auto industry had obscured the hazards of diesel.
Other automakers including Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, and Mercedes-Benz paid fines to settle accusations they had also illegally concealed emissions, though none was accused of doing so on the same scale as Volkswagen, the second-largest carmaker in the world after Toyota.
The scandal prompted European authorities to tighten air quality standards and encourage sales of electric vehicles, which have surpassed diesels in popularity. Diesels once accounted for more than 50 percent of new cars in Europe, but recently accounted for 13 percent.
In the United States, Volkswagen agreed to pay $ 15 billion to settle civil and criminal claims stemming from the scandal. That included fines, compensation to owners of diesel vehicles and a fund that local governments could tap to buy electric school buses or pay for other projects to reduce air pollution. As part of the settlement, Volkswagen funded the creation of Electrify America, which operates one of the largest electric car charging networks in the country today.
Testimony in German criminal trials does not always take place on consecutive days, and the proceedings can last years. Four lower-ranking Volkswagen executives have been jointly on trial in Braunschweig since 2021. That trial is expected to last until January.
Outside the courthouse on Tuesday, Matti Holtz, a Volkswagen factory worker and a father of two, stood with others while carrying a protest poster. Mr. Holtz, who owns a Volkswagen, said he wished punishment for Mr. Winterkorn, not only for the "fraud of the customers," but also because of the "intentional poisoning of people and nature."
The court has scheduled about 90 days of testimony in Mr. Winterkorn's case, which is expected to last until September 2025.

Electric Mercedes-Benz Blaze Jolts South Korea's E.V. Transition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The government is aggressively promoting electric cars. But a dramatic blaze in an underground lot has left some potential buyers worried about safety.
The flames and smoke from a burning Mercedes-Benz electric sedan spread rapidly through the underground parking lot of an apartment complex in South Korea this month. The fire damaged almost 900 cars, and 23 people suffered smoke inhalation.
It took firefighters more than eight hours to put out the blaze, which reached temperatures above 1,500 degrees Celsius, according to officials in Incheon, the city near Seoul where the fire broke out around dawn on Aug. 1.
Fires are much less common in electric vehicles than in gasoline-powered ones, and the cause of the Incheon blaze has not been disclosed. But across South Korea, one of the world's biggest car producers, it caught the public's attention because of its scale and intensity, and it raised safety fears that some say could impede the government's aggressive push toward electric vehicles.
One popular secondhand car sales platform, K Car, said that listings by E.V. owners hoping to sell their vehicles had nearly tripled since the fire.
"I know that E.V.s might be the more environmentally friendly choice, but I'm still afraid of it catching fire," said Lee Min, an office worker in Seoul who is hoping to buy her first car. "I got even more scared after seeing the Incheon incident."
News coverage of the fire, and social media's reaction to it, have focused on perceived risks from battery charging, and car makers and government officials have tried to assuage those fears. The municipal government in Seoul said that by the end of next month, it would prevent E.V.s from being fully charged in parking lots beneath residential buildings, limiting them to 90-percent capacity to prevent the risk of overcharging, though some experts have questioned whether that would do much to improve safety.
Some automakers, including Mercedes-Benz Korea, have offered owners free safety checks on their E.V.s and identified their battery suppliers. The German automaker said a Chinese company, Farasis Energy, had supplied the battery in the sedan that caught fire. Farasis did not respond to a request for comment.
"The popularity of E.V.s is going to decrease for the next while," said Lee Ho-Guen, a professor of automotive engineering at Daeduk University in the city of Daejeon. "People are scared."
Before the fire, South Korea's E.V. market had been growing at a clip, accounting for 9.3 percent of new cars in the country last year, according to official data.
The national government has rolled out subsidies for buyers as well as tax breaks for E.V. makers, part of an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 40 percent by 2030, compared to 2018 levels. It hopes to end sales of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. The government has spent 371.5 billion Korean won, or about $ 280 million, to install charging facilities.
There have been almost 200 electric vehicle fires across the nation over the past six and a half years, according to government figures. That does not include a fire at a lithium battery factory near the capital that killed 23 workers in June, one of the country's worst industrial disasters in recent years.
Lithium, which is used in most E.V. batteries, can store large amounts of energy in a small space, but it burns intensely when on fire. There are no government-approved extinguishers designed for lithium battery fires, according to South Korea's national fire department.
Electric vehicles catch fire less frequently than other types of vehicles. For every 100,000 E.V.s, there are just 25 fires, compared to 1,530 for gasoline-powered vehicles, according to the United States' National Transportation and Safety Board. Battery fires, however, can be much larger and more damaging, Mr. Lee, the engineering professor, said.
Despite the statistics, fires have raised concern about E.V.s' safety in many countries, including the United States. The Incheon blaze resonated in South Korea because many people live in apartment blocks and share underground parking lots.
Security video footage released by news outlets shows smoke coming out of the Mercedes EQE 350 before it burst into flames. The vehicle, which was on a floor with a capacity for about 2,000 cars, was not plugged in at the time, according to the local fire department.
Hundreds of residents have been temporarily moved out of the building while repair work takes place.
Days after the fire, Mathias Vaitl, the president of Mercedes-Benz Korea, said the company would pay 4.5 billion won, or around $ 3.4 million, to affected residents. Mercedes-Benz said in a statement it was deeply sorry to all impacted by the fire, but did not comment on the cause.
The German automaker released a list of its battery suppliers in the wake of the fire, and other companies followed suit, including Hyundai and Kia. Over the weekend, the government said it would require all automakers to disclose their battery suppliers by early next year.
The government discussed comprehensive measures to alleviate public concern and ensure that such a mass fire doesn't happen again, a spokeswoman said at a televised briefing on Sunday.
Mr. Lee, the engineering professor, said the government needed to upgrade charging infrastructure and fire-response systems. He said that a 90-percent cap on battery charges, on its own, was unlikely to prevent all fires.
"It's like asking a smoker to smoke two cigarettes instead of three," he said.

Philosopher President, Near His End, on How to Be Truly Free: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A decade ago, the world had a brief fascination with José Mujica. He was the folksy president of Uruguay who had shunned his nation's presidential palace to live in a tiny tin-roof home with his wife and three-legged dog.
In speeches to world leaders, interviews with foreign journalists and documentaries on Netflix, Pepe Mujica, as he is universally known, shared countless tales from a life story fit for film. He had robbed banks as a leftist urban guerrilla; survived 15 years as a prisoner, including by befriending a frog while kept in a hole in the ground; and helped lead the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world's healthiest and most socially liberal democracies.
But Mr. Mujica's legacy will be more than his colorful history and commitment to austerity. He became one of Latin America's most influential and important figures in large part for his plain-spoken philosophy on the path to a better society and happier life.
Now, as Mr. Mujica puts it, he is fighting death. In April, he announced he would undergo radiation for a tumor in his esophagus. At 89 and already diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, he admitted the path to recovery would be arduous.
Last week, I traveled to the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay's capital, to visit Mr. Mujica at his three-room home, full of books and jars of pickling vegetables, on the small farm where he has grown chrysanthemums for decades. As the sun set on a winter day, he was bundled in a winter jacket and wool hat in front of a wood stove. The treatment had left him weak and hardly eating.
"You're talking to a strange old man," he said, leaning in to look at me closely, a glisten in his eye. "I don't fit in today's world."
And so we began.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
How is your health?
They did radiation treatment on me. My doctors said it went well, but I'm broken.
(Unprompted.)
I think that humanity, as it's going, is doomed.
Why do you say that?
We waste a lot of time uselessly. We can live more peacefully. Take Uruguay. Uruguay has 3.5 million people. It imports 27 million pairs of shoes. We make garbage and work in pain. For what?
You're free when you escape the law of necessity -- when you spend the time of your life on what you desire. If your needs multiply, you spend your life covering those needs.
Humans can create infinite needs. The market dominates us, and it robs us of our lives.
Humanity needs to work less, have more free time and be more grounded. Why so much garbage? Why do you have to change your car? Change the refrigerator?
There is only one life and it ends. You have to give meaning to it. Fight for happiness, not just for wealth.
Do you believe that humanity can change?
It could change. But the market is very strong. It has generated a subliminal culture that dominates our instinct. It's subjective. It's unconscious. It has made us voracious buyers. We live to buy. We work to buy. And we live to pay. Credit is a religion. So we're kind of screwed up.
It seems you don't have much hope.
Biologically, I do have hope, because I believe in man. But when I think about it, I'm pessimistic.
Yet your speeches often have a positive message.
Because life is beautiful. With all its ups and downs, I love life. And I'm losing it because it's my time to leave. What meaning can we give to life? Man, compared to other animals, has the ability to find a purpose.
Or not. If you don't find it, the market will have you paying bills the rest of your life.
If you find it, you will have something to live for. Those who investigate, those who play music, those who love sports, anything. Something that fills your life.
Why did you choose to live in your own home as president?
The cultural remnants of feudalism remain. The red carpet. The bugle. Presidents like to be praised.
I once went to Germany and they put me in a Mercedes-Benz. The door weighed about 3,000 kilos. They put 40 motorcycles in front and another 40 in back. I was ashamed.
We have a house for the president. It's four stories. To have tea you have to walk three blocks. Useless. They should make it a high school.
How would you like to be remembered?
Ah, like what I am: a crazy old man.
That's all? You did a lot.
I have one thing. The magic of the word.
The book is the greatest invention of man. It's a shame that people read so little. They don't have time.
Nowadays people do much of their reading on phones.
Four years ago, I threw mine away. It made me crazy. All day talking nonsense.
We must learn to speak with the person inside us. It was him who saved my life. Since I was alone for many years, that has stayed with me.
When I'm in the field working with the tractor, sometimes I stop to see how a little bird constructs its nest. He was born with the program. He's already an architect. Nobody taught him. Do you know the hornero bird? They are perfect bricklayers.
I admire nature. I almost have a sort of pantheism. You have to have the eyes to see it.
The ants are one of the true communists out there. They are much older than us and they will outlive us. All colony beings are very strong.
Going back to phones: Are you saying they are too much for us?
It's not the phone's fault. We're the ones who are not ready. We make a disastrous use of it.
Children walk around with a university in their pocket. That's wonderful. However, we have advanced more in technology than in values.
Yet the digital world is where so much of life is now lived.
Nothing replaces this. (He gestures at the two of us talking.) This is nontransferable. We're not only speaking through words. We communicate with gestures, with our skin. Direct communication is irreplaceable.
We are not so robotic. We learned to think, but first we are emotional beings. We believe we decide with our heads. Many times the head finds the arguments to justify the decisions made by the gut. We're not as aware as we seem.
And that's fine. That mechanism is what keeps us alive. It's like the cow that follows what's green. If there is green, there is food. It's going to be tough to give up who we are.
You have said in the past that you don't believe in God. What is your view of God in this moment of your life?
Sixty percent of humanity believes in something, and that must be respected. There are questions without answers. What is the meaning of life? Where do we come from? Where are we going?
We don't easily accept the fact that we are an ant in the infinity of the universe. We need the hope of God because we would like to live.
Do you have some kind of God?
No. I greatly respect people who believe. It's like a consolation when faced with the idea of death.
Because the contradiction of life is that it is a biological program designed to struggle to live. But from the moment the program starts, you are condemned to die.
It seems biology is an important part of your worldview.
We are interdependent. We couldn't live without the prokaryotes we have in our intestine. We depend on a number of bugs that we don't even see. Life is a chain and it is still full of mysteries.
I hope human life will be prolonged, but I'm worried. There are many crazy people with atomic weapons. A lot of fanaticism. We should be building windmills. Yet we spend on weapons.
What a complicated animal man is. He's both smart and stupid.

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — A decade ago, the world had a brief fascination with José Mujica. He was the folksy president of Uruguay who had shunned his nation’s presidential palace to live in a tiny tin-roof home with his wife and three-legged dog.
In speeches to world leaders, interviews with foreign journalists and documentaries on Netflix, Pepe Mujica, as he is universally known, shared countless tales from a life story fit for film. He had robbed banks as a leftist urban guerrilla; survived 15 years as a prisoner, including by befriending a frog while kept in a hole in the ground; and helped lead the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world’s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies.
But Mujica’s legacy will be more than his colorful history and commitment to austerity. He became one of Latin America’s most influential and important figures in large part for his plain-spoken philosophy on the path to a better society and happier life.
Now, as Mujica puts it, he is fighting death. In April, he announced he would undergo radiation for a tumor in his esophagus. At 89 and already diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, he admitted the path to recovery would be arduous.
Last week, I traveled to the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, to visit Mujica at his three-room home, full of books and jars of pickling vegetables, on the small farm where he has grown chrysanthemums for decades. As the sun set on a winter day, he was bundled in a winter jacket and wool hat in front of a wood stove. The treatment had left him weak and hardly eating.
“You’re talking to a strange old man,” he said, leaning in to look at me closely, a glisten in his eye. “I don’t fit in today’s world.”
And so we began.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Q: How is your health?
They did radiation treatment on me. My doctors said it went well, but I’m broken.
(Unprompted.)
I think that humanity, as it’s going, is doomed.
Q: Why do you say that?
A: We waste a lot of time uselessly. We can live more peacefully. Take Uruguay. Uruguay has 3.5 million people. It imports 27 million pairs of shoes. We make garbage and work in pain. For what?
You’re free when you escape the law of necessity — when you spend the time of your life on what you desire. If your needs multiply, you spend your life covering those needs.
Humans can create infinite needs. The market dominates us, and it robs us of our lives.
Humanity needs to work less, have more free time and be more grounded. Why so much garbage? Why do you have to change your car? Change the refrigerator?
There is only one life and it ends. You have to give meaning to it. Fight for happiness, not just for wealth.
Q: Do you believe that humanity can change?
A: It could change. But the market is very strong. It has generated a subliminal culture that dominates our instinct. It’s subjective. It’s unconscious. It has made us voracious buyers. We live to buy. We work to buy. And we live to pay. Credit is a religion. So we’re kind of screwed up.
Q: It seems you don’t have much hope.
A: Biologically, I do have hope, because I believe in man. But when I think about it, I’m pessimistic.
Q: Yet your speeches often have a positive message.
A: Because life is beautiful. With all its ups and downs, I love life. And I’m losing it because it’s my time to leave. What meaning can we give to life? Man, compared to other animals, has the ability to find a purpose.
Or not. If you don’t find it, the market will have you paying bills the rest of your life.
If you find it, you will have something to live for. Those who investigate, those who play music, those who love sports, anything. Something that fills your life.
Q: Why did you choose to live in your own home as president?
A: The cultural remnants of feudalism remain. The red carpet. The bugle. Presidents like to be praised.
I once went to Germany and they put me in a Mercedes-Benz. The door weighed about 3,000 kilos. They put 40 motorcycles in front and another 40 in back. I was ashamed.
We have a house for the president. It’s four stories. To have tea you have to walk three blocks. Useless. They should make it a high school.
Q: How would you like to be remembered?
A: Ah, like what I am: a crazy old man.
Q: That’s all? You did a lot.
A: I have one thing. The magic of the word.
The book is the greatest invention of man. It’s a shame that people read so little. They don’t have time.
Q: Nowadays people do much of their reading on phones.
A: Four years ago, I threw mine away. It made me crazy. All day talking nonsense.
We must learn to speak with the person inside us. It was him who saved my life. Since I was alone for many years, that has stayed with me.
When I’m in the field working with the tractor, sometimes I stop to see how a little bird constructs its nest. He was born with the program. He’s already an architect. Nobody taught him. Do you know the hornero bird? They are perfect bricklayers.
I admire nature. I almost have a sort of pantheism. You have to have the eyes to see it.
The ants are one of the true communists out there. They are much older than us and they will outlive us. All colony beings are very strong.
Q: Going back to phones: Are you saying they are too much for us?
A: It’s not the phone’s fault. We’re the ones who are not ready. We make a disastrous use of it.
Children walk around with a university in their pocket. That’s wonderful. However, we have advanced more in technology than in values.
Q: Yet the digital world is where so much of life is now lived.
A: Nothing replaces this. (He gestures at the two of us talking.) This is nontransferable. We’re not only speaking through words. We communicate with gestures, with our skin. Direct communication is irreplaceable.
We are not so robotic. We learned to think, but first we are emotional beings. We believe we decide with our heads. Many times the head finds the arguments to justify the decisions made by the gut. We’re not as aware as we seem.
And that’s fine. That mechanism is what keeps us alive. It’s like the cow that follows what’s green. If there is green, there is food. It’s going to be tough to give up who we are.
Q: You have said in the past that you don’t believe in God. What is your view of God in this moment of your life?
A: Sixty percent of humanity believes in something, and that must be respected. There are questions without answers. What is the meaning of life? Where do we come from? Where are we going?
We don’t easily accept the fact that we are an ant in the infinity of the universe. We need the hope of God because we would like to live.
Q: Do you have some kind of God?
A: No. I greatly respect people who believe. It’s like a consolation when faced with the idea of ​​death.
Because the contradiction of life is that it is a biological program designed to struggle to live. But from the moment the program starts, you are condemned to die.
Q: It seems biology is an important part of your worldview.
A: We are interdependent. We couldn’t live without the prokaryotes we have in our intestine. We depend on a number of bugs that we don’t even see. Life is a chain and it is still full of mysteries.
I hope human life will be prolonged, but I’m worried. There are many crazy people with atomic weapons. A lot of fanaticism. We should be building windmills. Yet we spend on weapons.

Bitter Opposition Blocks Lithium Mine in Serbia: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Rio Tinto mine that Europe sees as a critical source for electric vehicle batteries has been the target of enormous protests. "I don't need green cars. I need green apples and green grass," said one opponent.
Their windows broken and roofs smashed, the abandoned homes in an otherwise bucolic valley carpeted with cornfields and orchards near Serbia's border with Bosnia look like the wreckage of the Balkan wars of the 1990s.
But the houses are actually the casualties of a current struggle freighted with geopolitics: where and how Europe can get the materials it needs to make electric car batteries and break its dependence on sources like China.
The houses, in the Jadar Valley in the west of Serbia, were bought up years ago by the minerals behemoth Rio Tinto, which planned to tear them down and start mining and processing lithium, a crucial element for electric car batteries. Its plans stalled by vociferous opposition, the company left the properties to crumble.
The project has been supported by the United States and the European Union, which is in desperate need of lithium to meet its climate goals. But it has generated a wave of public fury in Serbia, where fears that the mine will poison the air and water have set off huge street protests against President Aleksandar Vucic.
Europe has plenty of lithium and more than 20 mining projects for the mineral at various stages of development. But none have started producing battery-grade lithium. The giant project in Serbia was aimed at filling that hole.
"There is no green transition in Europe without this lithium," said Chad Blewitt, the head of Rio Tinto's Serbian operations, adding that the company planned to invest more than $ 2.55 billion in the project.
The Serbian government gave preliminary approval in 2019, but, worried about losing votes during protests against Rio Tinto before a 2022 election, canceled it.
Under pressure from the European Union, which Serbia aspires to join, the government changed its mind in July, allowing Rio Tinto to revive the project. The British-Australian multinational says it has already invested nearly $ 600 million to buy land, dig 500 exploratory holes, commission studies and make donations to the local soccer club and other entities.
Serbia's mining minister, Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, said mining probably would not start for another two years, but once it did, lithium from the Jadar Valley would allow Serbia to manufacture batteries and electric cars, providing about 20,000 jobs.
A report by The Hague Center for Strategic Studies estimates that if it is to reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, Europe will need 60 times more lithium by that year than what it imported in 2020 from China and elsewhere.
Michael Schmidt, a lithium expert at Germany's Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, said Europe might be able to reach its targets without supplies from Serbia. But, he said, "the Serbian project is one of the largest, and that is why it is so significant." He added, "We need each and every project to reach targets."
The success of the projects ultimately depends on the price for lithium on the global market and whether companies like Rio Tinto can recoup their investments. The price has collapsed over the past 18 months as Chinese demand has slackened and its output soared.
The proposed mine in Serbia has not only provoked fury among farmers, environmental activists and ordinary citizens, it also has become a proxy battleground in the West's efforts to extract the country from the orbits of Russia, its traditional ally, and China.
Geoffrey R. Pyatt, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for energy resources, this past week cheered the Serbian lithium project on social media as "an opportunity to contribute to the green transition at home & abroad."
For those who view Serbia as a partner for the United States and Europe rather than a Moscow-aligned and authoritarian regional bully, Mr. Vucic's support for Rio Tinto, along with his assent to Serbian-made weapons being sold covertly to Ukraine, is evidence he was serious about disengaging from Russia.
Russia has strong support among hard-line Serb nationalists, and some diplomats and analysts say Moscow has been stirring the unrest over the mine. Mr. Vucic, however, has said Moscow told him that the West is orchestrating the protests because it wants to topple him.
"Unfortunately, it has become a political fight, a big political battle," said the mining minister, Ms. Djedovic Handanovic.
Among those taking part in recent nationwide demonstrations against Rio Tinto have been leaders of People's Patrol, an ultranationalist group aligned with Moscow. Social media accounts known for spreading Russian disinformation have been active in promoting horror stories about the planned lithium mine.
But leftists and middle-of-the-road pro-Europeans have also joined the protests, chanting opposition to a project that has become a lightning rod for diverse grievances against the government.
"He sold out Kosovo but is not going to take away our clean water," read a sign denouncing Mr. Vucic that was held by Angela Rojovic, 25, at a recent protest in Belgrade, the capital. She said the president had not done enough to defend the interests of Serbs living in mainly ethnic Albanian Kosovo.
And she said Mr. Vucic was sacrificing Serbia's environment to serve Europe's climate goals. "I don't need green cars," she said. "I need green apples and green grass."
In Gornje Nedeljice, a Jadar Valley village that sits atop Europe's biggest known deposit of high-grade lithium, the project has alienated Mr. Vucic's previously stalwart rural base.
Dragan Karajcic, the district head for a cluster of small settlements around the proposed mine, said he was a member of Mr. Vucic's governing party but still joined a local protest group hostile to Rio Tinto and the government.
"We are not trying to bring down the government," he said. "The government is doing that itself."
Goran Tomic, a native of Gornje Nedeljice who now lives mostly in Germany, said he understood the need to combat climate change by moving away from gasoline-powered cars, but he was still appalled that his older brother had agreed to sell his house and land to Rio Tinto.
"He allowed himself to betray himself for money, and in doing that he betrayed us all," Mr. Tomic said, sitting on his front stoop with his mother, who was also angry but proud that two of her three sons refused to sell to Rio Tinto.
Its assurances over safety undermined by past misbehavior, Rio Tinto has tried to counter what it dismisses as lies and disinformation spread on social media by recently disclosing preliminary findings of an environmental impact assessment. It was carried out by Serbian and foreign scientists who debunked much of what protesters believe about lithium mining.
Wild claims on social media included one last week that an exploratory hole bored by Rio Tinto was belching radioactive fluid.
Mr. Vucic, rattled by the scale and intensity of public anger, has also veered into fear-mongering, claiming protests were led by "anarchists, Marxists and hidden fascists."
The real leaders, however, were people like Nebojsa Petkovic, a villager from Gornje Nedeljice and an activist who traveled to Belgrade to help organize a demonstration on Saturday, Aug. 10, that attracted tens of thousands of people.
"Let the Germans save the planet," Mr. Petkovic said. "We need to save ourselves."
Eager to get mining started, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and executives of Mercedes Benz, which has big electric vehicle plans, visited Belgrade last month to applaud the Rio Tinto project.
Germany's role, however, has only amplified opposition.
Mr. Karajcic, the district head, said he was infuriated by German assurances that the mine would be safe, recalling Nazi atrocities in a nearby town in 1941 that the Germans had promised would be left unhurt.
He said his great-grandfather fought nearby against Austrian troops during World War I. "He fought to keep our land, and now I'm supposed to give it away to Rio Tinto. No way," he said. "There is a lot of bad blood in these hills."

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey instructed state officials on Friday to remove his name from the Nov. 5 ballot.
Senator Robert Menendez, a famously pugnacious Democrat whose five-decade political career came to a crashing halt last month when he was convicted of corruption, has run his final race for re-election.
After resisting what felt all-but inevitable to people close to the senator, Mr. Menendez pulled his name from November's ballot hours before the Friday deadline. He had planned to run as an independent.
"I am advising you that I wish to have my name withdrawn from the ballot," Mr. Menendez wrote in a one-sentence email to the New Jersey Division of Elections.
Mr. Menendez, 70, was found guilty of taking bribes and acting as an agent of Egypt after a two-month trial in Manhattan, and he had virtually no chance of winning re-election.
He had not mounted a campaign and is reliant on his shrinking election war chest to pay lawyers as he prepares to appeal his conviction on 16 criminal counts. He has also dipped into his campaign funds to pay lawyers representing his wife, Nadine Menendez, who is awaiting trial on charges that she traded her husband's political influence for cash, gold and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.
But until Friday it was unclear whether voters might get one more chance to cast a vote for Mr. Menendez, who has lost only one campaign in his storied political career -- his first race for mayor of Union City, N.J., in 1982.
Mr. Menendez did not compete in the Democratic primary in June, but he did file three times the requisite number of signatures needed to lock in a spot on the ballot in November. He had until the end of Friday to pull his name off the ballot.
Had he opted against bowing out, he would have faced off against Curtis Bashaw, a Republican hotel developer, and Representative Andy Kim, a third-term congressman who won the Democratic primary with 75 percent of the vote and is heavily favored to win in November. Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by nearly one million registered voters, and it has been more than 50 years since the state elected a Republican senator.
Mr. Kim, 42, said he doubted that Mr. Menendez would have had a meaningful effect on the race results.
"I'm not particularly concerned," Mr. Kim said after a campaign event in Maywood, N.J., just before Mr. Menendez's letter was filed. "It's not keeping me up at night."
Mr. Menendez can continue to use his remaining $ 3.3 million in campaign funds to pay legal fees even though he is no longer running for office. But he is now precluded from accepting additional campaign contributions, which had tapered off drastically since he was indicted in September. He took in just $ 731.50 from mid-May through the end of June, according to his most recent Federal Election Commission filing.
There was more activity in a defense fund he had established to help pay his legal fees. Twenty-one donors contributed a total of $ 127,500 between April and July, federal records show. He can legally continue to accept donations to the defense fund, regardless of his status as a candidate.
Mr. Menendez's legal woes have proved to be a source of significant embarrassment for Democrats struggling to hold on to the White House and retain their narrow margin in the Senate.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, refrained from calling for Mr. Menendez's resignation until after his conviction. On Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer had no immediate comment on Mr. Menendez's decision to abandon his race for re-election.
Mr. Bashaw, the Republican hoping to replace Mr. Menendez in Washington, said it was "time to move on with this election and make it a clean, straightforward race focusing on the issues facing our state."
Ms. Menendez's trial has been delayed while she is being treated for breast cancer. Friday was also the deadline for her lawyers to provide Judge Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court with additional medical records that may be used to determine when Ms. Menendez, 57, might be ready to stand trial.
As of late Friday afternoon, there was no record that her lawyer, Barry Coburn, had filed the requested documents, which are likely to be sealed from public view to safeguard Ms. Menendez's medical privacy. Mr. Coburn said he had no comment.
Mr. Menendez, his two co-defendants and a disgraced insurance broker who pleaded guilty and testified against the senator during the trial are all scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 29. Each faces decades in prison.
A week after his conviction, Mr. Menendez said he would step down from his Senate seat at the end of the day on Aug. 20.
Earlier on Friday, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that he had selected George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to replace Mr. Menendez in the Senate through the Nov. 5 election.
After the election, Mr. Helmy, 44, will step down and the governor will appoint the winner of the Senate race to the seat, roughly two months early.
Mr. Kim said he supported the governor's plan to keep Mr. Helmy in the temporary role only until voters had decided who will represent New Jersey in the Senate for the next six years.
"You should want to try to keep that as short as possible," Mr. Kim said, "and if you have the opportunity to have a duly elected person come in -- I think that's good."

Menendez Plans To Quit Senate: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey was facing a possible expulsion vote after his conviction on federal corruption charges last week.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey announced on Tuesday that he would resign from Congress effective in late August, bowing to intense pressure from Democratic colleagues who had pushed him to step down or face an expulsion vote after his conviction in a vast international bribery scheme.
Mr. Menendez has maintained his innocence and vowed to appeal a guilty verdict returned last week by a federal jury in Manhattan. But with the Senate Ethics Committee fast-tracking a vote to expel him, he opted to quit his term months early, rather than force an ugly intraparty fight that threatened to make him the first senator ousted since the Civil War.
Mr. Menendez conveyed his resignation in a letter to Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, shortly after he shared the news with what remained of his staff. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said he would promptly appoint a replacement who would serve until January.
In the letter, Mr. Menendez, 70, said he had concluded that his presence in the Senate would only complicate his efforts to clear his name and salvage his legacy. However, he notably left open the possibility that he might remain a long-shot candidate for re-election this fall as a political independent; he has until Aug. 16 to take his name off the ballot.
"While I fully intend to appeal the jury's verdict, all the way and including to the Supreme Court, I do not want the Senate to be involved in a lengthy process that will detract from its important work," the senator wrote.
By delaying his departure until August, Mr. Menendez will allow his staff members time to find new jobs but also ensure that he receives another month's salary and health insurance at a time when his finances are crumbling and his wife, Nadine Menendez, is undergoing cancer treatment. His resignation will not immediately affect his federal pension, though the senator could still stand to lose it under an anticorruption law if his conviction is upheld.
And yet, there was no avoiding the magnitude of the collapse of his storied five-decade career -- one that saw Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, rise from mayor of his hometown, Union City, N.J., to become the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the most senior Latinos in Washington.
For much of that time, the senator had looked invincible, no more so than after he avoided a conviction on earlier federal bribery charges at a lengthy trial in New Jersey in 2017.
Now, Mr. Menendez has been branded a felon, convicted of selling his office for bars of gold and making himself an agent of a foreign power. He faces decades in prison when Judge Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court sentences him on Oct. 29.
Mr. Menendez had faced calls for his resignation since he, his wife and three New Jersey businessmen were first charged last fall with taking part in a yearslong bribery conspiracy. But demands that he step aside intensified after the jury found him guilty of 16 federal crimes on July 16.
The counts included helping to disrupt criminal cases for friends, locking in a lucrative Egyptian halal certification monopoly for an ally and using his political influence to cement a business deal with an investment fund run by a Qatari sheikh.
In exchange, the government said that he and his wife were rewarded with gold, cash and a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible. F.B.I. agents discovered bars of gold bullion worth more than $ 100,000 and roughly $ 480,000 in cash stuffed into envelopes, a shopping bag, boots and a closet safe.
There is nothing in the Constitution or in the Senate's rules that required Mr. Menendez to give up his seat upon conviction. But his colleagues appeared intent on denying him the choice to stay, even if it meant using a rare expulsion vote. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Mr. Menendez's political protégé, volunteered to lead the effort, and the bipartisan Ethics Committee had indicated on Monday that it was moving "expeditiously" to complete the procedural work needed to tee up a vote.
The political context had also changed, upended by President Biden's decision to bow out of his race for re-election and the possibility of former President Donald J. Trump's return to power. Mr. Menendez's continued presence in Washington would have been a distraction for a party trying to refocus its energy on retaining the White House and its slim Senate majority.
Still, the relief for Democrats on Tuesday was not complete. The party was left to wonder whether Mr. Menendez would follow through on his independent campaign for re-election that could shake Democrats' decades-long hold on the New Jersey Senate seat.
Representative Andy Kim won the Democratic nomination to run for Senate last month after a bruising contest with Tammy Murphy, the wife of the governor. Mr. Kim said on Tuesday that he would try to bring New Jersey into "a new era of politics built on integrity, service and delivering for all families."
Polls suggest there is no path for Mr. Menendez to win, but some in the party fear he might have enough of a nostalgic following, particularly among Latino voters, to siphon off Democratic votes and create an opening for the Republican nominee, Curtis Bashaw.
Even a modest level of support for Mr. Menendez "could be consequential," according to Mike DuHaime, a Republican political consultant advising Mr. Bashaw.
"The D.C. folks are definitely paying attention," he said.
Mr. Murphy, the governor, was already winnowing a list of potential successors to temporarily fill Mr. Menendez's seat. According to several current and former aides, the list included Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way; Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman; Nina Mitchell Wells, a former New Jersey secretary of state; and George Helmy, Mr. Murphy's former chief of staff.
The governor's wife quickly removed herself from consideration Tuesday afternoon. "While I'm grateful for the humbling support and outreach I've received since last year, I want to reiterate that I will not accept an appointment to the U.S. Senate," she wrote on X.
The aides familiar with his thinking said that Mr. Murphy was opposed to appointing Mr. Kim, despite pressure from Washington to give him the title of senator and the advantages of incumbency ahead of November's race. Mr. Kim has indicated he would accept an appointment if one was offered.
Though the biggest question was answered by Mr. Menendez's planned resignation, his Senate colleagues were left to adjudicate smaller ones in the interim. For example, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said he would leave it to the Ethics Committee to determine whether Mr. Menendez should continue receiving classified intelligence briefings or serving on the Foreign Relations Committee given the nature of his conviction.
As others turned their attention to the future, though, many of Mr. Menendez's former aides and longtime friends expressed melancholy at the end to an often-distinguished career and the specter of what could amount to a lifetime prison sentence.
One noted ruefully that Mr. Menendez's sentencing date coincided with the 12th anniversary of Superstorm Sandy and the disaster recovery that he helped to lead. Another cited the senator's unwavering, decades-long support on behalf of New Jersey's large and varied immigrant communities.
Tasos D. Zambas, a close friend of Mr. Menendez who attended parts of his two-month trial, said the man prosecutors described in court was unrecognizable.
"Agent of a foreign government? You've got to be kidding me," said Mr. Zambas, who grew up in Union City after fleeing Cyprus as a child in 1975. "He's an amazing individual. This is not who he is."
But last weekend, more than two dozen of the senator's onetime political foes gathered in Lavallette, on the Jersey Shore, for what an organizer described as a "Menendez conviction party." Guests wore T-shirts depicting hands gripping a jail cell above the words "BYE BYE BOBBY."

Even a modest level of support for Menendez “could be consequential,” according to Mike DuHaime, a Republican political consultant advising Bashaw.
“The D.C. folks are definitely paying attention,” he said.
Murphy was already winnowing a list of potential successors to temporarily fill Menendez’s seat. According to several current and former aides, the list included Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way; Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman; Nina Mitchell Wells, a former New Jersey secretary of state; and George Helmy, Murphy’s former chief of staff.
The governor’s wife quickly removed herself from consideration Tuesday afternoon. “While I’m grateful for the humbling support and outreach I’ve received since last year, I want to reiterate that I will not accept an appointment to the U.S. Senate,” she wrote on the social platform X.
The aides familiar with his thinking said that Murphy was opposed to appointing Kim, despite pressure from Washington to give him the title of senator and the advantages of incumbency before November’s race. Kim has indicated he would accept an appointment if one was offered.
Although the biggest question was answered by Menendez’s planned resignation, his Senate colleagues were left to adjudicate smaller ones in the interim. For example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and the majority leader, said he would leave it to the Ethics Committee to determine whether Menendez should continue receiving classified intelligence briefings or serving on the Foreign Relations Committee, given the nature of his conviction.
As others turned their attention to the future, though, many of Menendez’s former aides and longtime friends expressed melancholy at the end to an often-distinguished career and the specter of what could amount to a lifetime prison sentence.
One noted ruefully that Menendez’s sentencing date coincided with the 12th anniversary of Superstorm Sandy and the disaster recovery that he helped to lead. Another cited the senator’s unwavering, decades-long support on behalf of New Jersey’s large and varied immigrant communities.
Tasos D. Zambas, a close friend of Menendez who attended parts of his two-month trial, said the man prosecutors described in court was unrecognizable.
“Agent of a foreign government? You’ve got to be kidding me,” said Zambas, who grew up in Union City after fleeing Cyprus as a child in 1975. “He’s an amazing individual. This is not who he is.”
But last weekend, more than two dozen of the senator’s onetime political foes gathered in Lavallette, on the Jersey Shore, for what an organizer described as a “Menendez conviction party.” Guests wore T-shirts depicting hands gripping a jail cell above the words “BYE BYE BOBBY.”

AT&T Outage Blocked
Over 92 Million Calls
A nationwide AT&T Wireless outage in February that lasted over 12 hours blocked more than 92 million voice calls and prevented more than 25,000 attempts to reach 911, according to report released Monday.
The Federal Communications Commission's report came after a five-month investigation, which led the agency to refer the matter to its enforcement bureau for potential violations of F.C.C. rules, which could result in a fine.
The F.C.C. said all voice and 5G data services for customers were unavailable during the outage affecting more than 125 million devices.
The incident began after AT&T implemented a network change with an equipment configuration error, the F.C.C. said.
The agency added that network operators must adhere to their internal procedures and industry best practices when implementing network changes. REUTERS

AMC Creditors Agree
To Extend Debt Deadlines
AMC Entertainment said on Monday it had reached an agreement with creditors that extends up to $ 2.45 billion of debt maturities from 2026 to 2029 and beyond.
The agreement will also allow AMC to reduce debt by $ 464 million by converting exchangeable notes into equity.
The company had been grappling with the aftermath of the Hollywood strikes last year that shut down productions and affected theater chains across the country.
Under the terms of the deal, AMC will issue $ 1.2 billion of new secured term loans due 2029 in consideration for an open market purchase of senior secured term loans due 2026.
AMC and its units will also issue about $ 414 million of exchangeable notes for cash, with proceeds used to repurchase roughly $ 414 million of second-lien notes. REUTERS

Porsche Pulls Back
On Its E.V. Sales Goals
The luxury carmaker Porsche said on Monday that it expected the transition to electric vehicles to take longer than its previous aim of 80 percent of all sales by 2030.
It has now watered down that goal by tying it explicitly to customer demand and developments in the electromobility sector, saying only that it could now deliver on the 80 percent target if those factors warrant it.
Executives at carmakers from Mercedes-Benz to Renault have warned in recent months that goals they set in recent years for fully electric sales in the next decade were too ambitious, as customers remained hesitant to make the switch away from gas-powered cars.
Porsche, struggling with low E.V. sales this year so far, highlighted the disparity in its three key markets in E.V. uptake, with demand far ahead in China, slower in Europe and spotty in the United States. REUTERS

In Appeal of His Corruption Charges, Precedent May Give Menendez Hope: [National Desk]

Full text: The Supreme Court has narrowed the legal definition of corruption, with political figures in New York and elsewhere having their convictions overturned as a result.
They were once among New York's most powerful political figures: Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, and Dean G. Skelos, the onetime Republican leader of the State Senate. Then, both men were convicted in federal corruption trials, only to have the verdicts overturned on appeal.
Now, with Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, found guilty of corruption charges in the Southern District of New York, his lawyers say they will appeal his conviction aggressively and believe he, too, will be vindicated.
Defense lawyers make such claims routinely, but in the realm of federal corruption cases, they may have reason to be optimistic. The U.S. Supreme Court, in rulings since 2010, has narrowed the legal definition of corruption, resulting in a number of convictions of political figures in New York and elsewhere being overturned.
"We have seen the capacity of appeals courts to surprise us all," said Martin S. Bell, a former Southern District corruption prosecutor. "If Yogi Berra were to be heard on this, he'd probably say, it ain't really over until the appeals court sings."
Still, Mr. Bell and other legal experts said, prosecutors are learning to work within the new rules in ways that may withstand scrutiny from potentially skeptical higher courts.
At Mr. Menendez's trial, prosecutors presented evidence of a brazen plot in which, they said, the senator and his wife accepted bribes of gold bullion, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for his agreeing to do political favors at home and abroad. As part of the scheme, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez steered weapons and aid to Egypt.
After the verdict, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, whose office prosecuted Mr. Menendez, said the case had "always been about shocking levels of corruption."
"This wasn't politics as usual," Mr. Williams said. "This was politics for profit."
Mr. Menendez, 70, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was found guilty on all 16 counts he faced, including bribery, honest services wire fraud, conspiracy, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as an agent for Egypt.
"How much worse could the facts be?" said Carrie H. Cohen, one of the prosecutors at Mr. Silver's 2015 trial. "How far is the Supreme Court willing to go in limiting what it believes constitutes a bribe scheme under our federal law?" (Mr. Silver was retried and convicted; he died in prison.)
In a landmark 2016 ruling, the Supreme Court tightened the definition of the kind of "official act" that constituted one side of a quid pro quo in a bribery case involving a public official. The unanimous ruling threw out the conviction of Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia. The court held that a bribery scheme must involve an official performing more than routine courtesies like arranging a meeting. An official act has to involve more formal, concrete government actions, like filing a lawsuit or making an administrative determination.
Cheryl Bader, a law professor at Fordham University, said the McDonnell ruling noted that its more limited interpretation of "official act" left "ample room" for prosecutors to pursue corruption.
"There's a lot of areas within the law where there's shades of gray," Professor Bader said. "But at some point, we want to think about how to draw that line in a way that is sufficiently protective against criminality but also appreciates the necessity of lawmakers being able to do what they need to do."
"In the Menendez case, the prosecutors were able to find that sweet spot," she added.
The McDonnell decision loomed over Mr. Menendez's trial, including when his lawyers argued unsuccessfully last month after prosecutors rested their case that the charges against him be dismissed.
Avi Weitzman, a lawyer for the senator, told the judge, Sidney H. Stein, that the government had failed to prove that Mr. Menendez performed an official act in the alleged bribery schemes presented by prosecutors.
Mr. Weitzman also argued that there was no evidence of an agreement that constituted a quid pro quo between Mr. Menendez and any of his co-conspirators. The senator's wife, Nadine Menendez, 57, was also charged in the case, but her trial was postponed because she is being treated for breast cancer. She has pleaded not guilty.
At most, Mr. Weitzman told the judge, prosecutors were trying to draw inferences that were unsupported by the facts about an agreement that did not exist. The senator's actions were the kind of conduct he "often takes to benefit constituents," Mr. Weitzman said.
Another area of potential appeal was signaled by Mr. Menendez himself, in statements outside the courthouse after his conviction, when he roundly rejected the jury's finding that he acted as an agent for Egypt.
The verdict made him the first U.S. senator found guilty of acting as an agent for a foreign power.
Mr. Menendez said he had never violated his public oath and had never been anything but a patriot for his country.
"I have never, ever been a foreign agent," he said, "and the decision rendered by the jury today would put at risk every member of the United States Senate in terms of what they think a foreign agent would be."
Mr. Weitzman, in his arguments last month, said the government had not shown Mr. Menendez "took direction and instruction" from Egypt.
Daniel C. Richman, a Columbia Law School professor, said there is not a long history of judicial opinions providing clarity on where to draw the line between ordinary contacts with a foreign power that may be part of a legislator's work, and being an agent of that foreign power.
Regardless, he said, "when you're bought and paid for, you really are an agent in a way that is different from what we should in any way tolerate of a senator."
Mr. Menendez's lawyers could also appeal a pretrial ruling in which Judge Stein rejected their motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they flouted protections afforded to members of Congress under what is known as the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause.
The speech or debate privilege bars prosecutors from citing specific legislative actions in an effort to prove a federal lawmaker committed a crime.
During the trial, Mr. Menendez's lawyers successfully objected to particular text messages prosecutors wanted to show the jury that referred to the senator's approving or holding up aid to Egypt.
In an oral argument in May, outside of the jury's presence, a prosecutor, Paul M. Monteleoni, acknowledged that the "speech or debate" clause made the prosecution's life harder to an extent.
"But it is also not designed to make members of Congress super citizens immune from all criminal responsibility," Mr. Monteleoni said.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers could also appeal rulings by Judge Stein during the trial in which he admitted pieces of evidence the defense believed violated the speech or debate clause.
Josh Chafetz, a Georgetown University law professor who studies legislative procedure and the separation of powers, said he would be surprised if Mr. Menendez's case ended up being overturned, at least on the issue of the speech or debate clause.
Professor Chafetz said that the privilege was meant to be a jurisdictional bar to keep members of Congress from being dragged into court, but that the Supreme Court has adopted a narrower view of the provision at it pertains to bribery, thus affording federal legislators less protection.
"It seems to me the speech or debate clause rulings that the judge made in this case were very much consistent with what the Supreme Court has said," he added.
Mr. Menendez's appeal, when it is filed, may echo a theme of the Supreme Court's recent holding that former President Donald J. Trump was entitled to broad immunity from prosecution for official actions he took while in office, according to Rebecca Roiphe, a New York Law School professor.
The Trump and Menendez cases, Professor Roiphe said, were both about the central question of how to hold public officials accountable while still giving them sufficient leeway to do their jobs effectively.
"At a certain level of generality," she added, "the same central question about our democracy is at issue in both of these two cases."

Menendez Guilty in Scheme to Sell Political Favors: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was found guilty of bribery, conspiracy, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a powerful Democrat who once led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was convicted on Tuesday of participating in a vast international bribery scheme, in which prosecutors said he had accepted gold, cash and other payoffs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors abroad and at home.
A Manhattan jury returned the verdict after deliberating for about 13 hours over three days in Federal District Court. Mr. Menendez was found guilty on all 16 counts he faced, including bribery, honest services wire fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and acting as an agent for Egypt.
The verdict made Mr. Menendez the first United States senator to be found guilty of acting as an agent of a foreign power and the seventh to be convicted of a federal crime while in office.
Mr. Menendez, 70, now faces the possibility of many years in prison when he is sentenced by the judge, Sidney H. Stein. Eight of the counts on which he was convicted carry potential 20-year sentences. The judge said he would sentence Mr. Menendez on Oct. 29.
The resounding verdict will almost certainly deliver a final blow to Mr. Menendez's storied four-decade political career and create intense pressure for him to leave office before his term expires at year's end. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and majority leader, said in a statement, "In light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate and our country, and resign."
Mr. Menendez had resisted calls to step down before his trial, but he could now face a rare expulsion vote by his Senate colleagues if he does not leave voluntarily. If the seat is vacated, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey would be able to name a replacement to fill out his term.
Outside the federal courthouse, Mr. Menendez said he was "deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury's decision." He said he had "every faith that the law and the facts did not sustain that decision" and that he would be successful upon appeal.
"I have never violated my public oath," Mr. Menendez said. "I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country."
The senator, who had criticized the prosecution for criminalizing routine legislative activity, addressed charges that he acted as an agent for the government of Egypt.
"I have never, ever been a foreign agent," Mr. Menendez said, "and the decision rendered by the jury today would put at risk every member of the United States Senate in terms of what they think a foreign agent would be."
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office prosecuted the senator, said, "This wasn't politics as usual; this was politics for profit." He said Mr. Menendez's "years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end."
"Corruption isn't costless," Mr. Williams added. "It erodes public trust, and it undermines the rule of law."
The verdict comes seven years after Mr. Menendez was tried in an unrelated federal bribery case, held in New Jersey, in which a jury said it could not reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. When Mr. Menendez was indicted in Manhattan last September, he became the first U.S. senator ever to face federal bribery charges twice.
Two businessmen -- Wael Hana, 40, and Fred Daibes, 66, -- were charged alongside Mr. Menendez. They were also found guilty of all counts they faced.
Lawrence S. Lustberg, Mr. Hana's lawyer, and César de Castro, Mr. Daibes's lawyer, each said their clients would pursue appeals.
"We're obviously very disappointed in today's verdict," Mr. Lustberg said. "We think it is contrary to justice and contrary to both the facts and the law."
Mr. Menendez's lawyers, Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, said the senator was "eager to aggressively pursue the very substantial legal issues on appeal to a higher court," and they said they expected he would be vindicated on appeal.
Jurors left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.
Mr. Menendez's trial was bookended by extraordinary legal and political turmoil. As it began in mid-May, former President Donald J. Trump was on trial in a state court down the block, where he was convicted on 34 felony counts two weeks later. Each morning, Mr. Trump's motorcade would roll up Worth Street directly past the entrance Mr. Menendez used to enter the federal courthouse.
Mr. Menendez spent the duration of the two-month trial in court and was not present in Washington, where he ordinarily would be at the center of legislative action. As the trial ended, he was absent from the debate over whether President Biden should continue his campaign for re-election. The day after the jury began deliberating, Mr. Trump was shot and injured in an assassination attempt during a political rally in Pennsylvania.
Even before the jury's verdict on Tuesday, the explosive array of bribery charges against Mr. Menendez had thrust New Jersey politics into disarray.
Representative Andy Kim, a Democrat, entered the race for Mr. Menendez's seat a day after the senator was indicted, drawing the ire of Democratic Party bosses in New Jersey who had already been asked to support a different candidate -- Tammy Murphy, the governor's wife.
Ms. Murphy, whose candidacy was damaged by claims of nepotism, dropped out of the contest in late March, days before the collapse of a mainstay of politics in New Jersey -- preferential ballot placement for candidates endorsed by party leaders.
After Mr. Kim filed a lawsuit challenging the practice, which for decades had given those candidates an often insurmountable edge by allowing them to be grouped in a single line, a judge ordered Democrats to redesign the ballots for the primary being held in June.
Mr. Kim won the Democratic nomination with 75 percent of the vote after a campaign that highlighted the shocking nature of the allegations against Mr. Menendez. He is now the odds-on favorite to win the seat in the November general election.
Over the years, Mr. Menendez attracted federal scrutiny as he rose through New Jersey's notoriously corrupt political circles and became one of the most powerful Latino politicians in Washington.
Soon after he was indicted last September, Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, said he had been singled out by prosecutors who "simply cannot accept that a first-generation Latino American from humble beginnings could rise to be a U.S. senator."
Throughout the trial, prosecutors presented testimony and other evidence that placed Mr. Menendez at the center of a web of corruption that intermingled sensitive matters of security in the Middle East and the bare-knuckle, backroom dealings of the senator's home state.
Mr. Menendez was charged with steering aid and weapons to Egypt, using his clout to help the government of Qatar and propping up Mr. Hana's lucrative halal certification business monopoly for meat sold in Egypt. Mr. Hana, in a text to an Egyptian general, referred to Mr. Menendez, who held sway over U.S. military sales, financing and other aid, as "our man."
Prosecutors also cited evidence showing Mr. Menendez tried to disrupt criminal investigations in New Jersey on behalf of two allies -- Mr. Daibes, a real estate developer, and Jose Uribe, a former insurance broker -- who helped funnel bribes to the senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez.
Ms. Menendez, 57, was indicted with her husband but was not tried with him. In April, Judge Stein postponed her trial after her lawyers said she would be undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She has pleaded not guilty.
In the scheme, Ms. Menendez was the senator's "go-between, demanding payment, receiving payment and passing messages, but always -- always -- keeping him informed," a prosecutor, Paul M. Monteleoni, said in a closing argument at the senator's trial.
"It wasn't enough for him to be one of the most powerful people in Washington," Mr. Monteleoni told the jury. "No, Robert Menendez wanted all that power, but he also wanted to use it to pile up riches for himself and his wife."
"So, Menendez sold the power of his office," Mr. Monteleoni added.
When the F.B.I. raided the Menendezes' home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in June 2022, agents found bars of gold bullion worth more than $ 100,000 and about $ 480,000 in cash, the evidence showed. They also found, parked in the driveway, a 2019 Mercedes-Benz convertible Mr. Uribe had given to Ms. Menendez.
Mr. Menendez has proclaimed his innocence ever since he was charged. In January, he delivered a defiant speech on the floor of the Senate, calling the case against him "baseless" and saying it had set a dangerous precedent that could be used against other senators.
During the senator's trial, his lawyers largely sought to shift blame for his troubles to Ms. Menendez. In an opening statement to the jury, his lawyer, Mr. Weitzman, cast her as an opportunist in dire financial straits who had kept her husband "in the dark" about what she was asking others to give her, and who "tried to get cash and assets any which way she could."
The senator's other lawyer, Mr. Fee, said in a closing argument that the government's case was based on half-truths, factual leaps, unsupported inference and guesses.
"The gaps you are being asked to fill are not based on evidence," Mr. Fee said.
In court Tuesday, as the jury forewoman announced the verdict, repeating "guilty" over and over again, Mr. Menendez leaned forward, elbows on the table in front of him, chin resting on his clasped hands. Later, after the jury was discharged and the packed courtroom cleared, Mr. Menendez quietly stood up, picked up a large folder holding documents and walked out.

NEW YORK — Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a powerful Democrat who once led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was convicted Tuesday of participating in a vast international bribery scheme in which prosecutors said he had accepted gold, cash and other payoffs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors abroad and at home.
A Manhattan jury returned the verdict after deliberating for about 13 hours over three days in U.S. District Court. Menendez was found guilty on all 16 counts he faced, including bribery, honest services wire fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and acting as an agent for Egypt.
The verdict made Menendez the first U.S. senator to be found guilty of acting as an agent of a foreign power and the seventh to be convicted of a federal crime while in office.
Menendez, 70, now faces the possibility of many years in prison when he is sentenced by the judge, Sidney Stein. Eight of the counts on which he was convicted carry potential 20-year sentences. The judge said he would sentence Menendez on Oct. 29.
The resounding verdict will almost certainly deliver a final blow to Menendez’s storied four-decade political career and create intense pressure for him to resign before his term expires at year’s end. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, “In light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate and our country, and resign.”
Menendez had resisted calls to step down before his trial, but he could now face a rare expulsion vote by his Senate colleagues if he does not leave voluntarily. If the seat is vacated, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy would be able to name a replacement to fill out his term.
Outside the federal courthouse, Menendez said he was “deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury’s decision.” He said he had “every faith that the law and the facts did not sustain that decision” and that he would be successful upon appeal.
“I have never violated my public oath,” Menendez said. “I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country.”
The senator, who had criticized the prosecution for criminalizing routine legislative activity, addressed charges that he acted as an agent for the government of Egypt.
“I have never, ever been a foreign agent,” Menendez said, “and the decision rendered by the jury today would put at risk every member of the United States Senate in terms of what they think a foreign agent would be.”
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office prosecuted the senator, said, “This wasn’t politics as usual; this was politics for profit.” He said Menendez’s “years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end.”
“Corruption isn’t costless,” Williams added. “It erodes public trust, and it undermines the rule of law.”
The verdict comes seven years after Menendez was tried in an unrelated federal bribery case, held in New Jersey, in which a jury said it could not reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. When Menendez was indicted in Manhattan last September, he became the first U.S. senator ever to face federal bribery charges twice.
Two businesspeople — Wael Hana, 40, and Fred Daibes, 66 — were charged alongside Menendez. They were also found guilty of all counts they faced.
Lawrence Lustberg, Hana’s lawyer, and César de Castro, Daibes’s lawyer, both said their clients would pursue appeals.
“We’re obviously very disappointed in today’s verdict,” Lustberg said. “We think it is contrary to justice and contrary to both the facts and the law.”
Menendez’s lawyers, Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, said the senator was “eager to aggressively pursue the very substantial legal issues on appeal to a higher court,” and they said they expected he would be vindicated on appeal.
Jurors left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.
Menendez’s trial was bookended by extraordinary legal and political turmoil. As it began in mid-May, former President Donald Trump was on trial in a state court down the block, where he was convicted on 34 felony counts two weeks later. Each morning, Trump’s motorcade would roll up Worth Street directly past the entrance Menendez used to enter the federal courthouse.
Menendez spent the duration of the two-month trial in court and was not present in Washington, where he ordinarily would be at the center of legislative action. As the trial ended, he was absent from the debate over whether President Joe Biden should continue his campaign for reelection. The day after the jury began deliberating, Trump was shot and injured in an assassination attempt during a political rally in Pennsylvania.
Even before the jury’s verdict on Tuesday, the explosive array of bribery charges against Menendez had thrust New Jersey politics into disarray.
Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, entered the race for Menendez’s seat a day after the senator was indicted, drawing the ire of Democratic Party bosses in New Jersey who had been asked to support a different candidate — Tammy Murphy, the governor’s wife.
Murphy, whose candidacy was damaged by claims of nepotism, dropped out of the contest in late March, days before the collapse of a mainstay of politics in New Jersey: preferential ballot placement for candidates endorsed by party leaders.
After Kim filed a lawsuit challenging the practice, which for decades had given those candidates an often insurmountable edge by allowing them to be grouped in a single line, a judge ordered Democrats to redesign the ballots for the primary being held in June.
Kim won the Democratic nomination with 75% of the vote after a campaign that highlighted the shocking nature of the allegations against Menendez. He is now the odds-on favorite to win the seat in the November general election.
Over the years, Menendez attracted federal scrutiny as he rose through New Jersey’s notoriously corrupt political circles and became one of the most powerful Latino politicians in Washington.
Soon after he was indicted last September, Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, said he had been singled out by prosecutors who “simply cannot accept that a first-generation Latino American from humble beginnings could rise to be a U.S. senator.”
Throughout the trial, prosecutors presented testimony and other evidence that placed Menendez at the center of a web of corruption that intermingled sensitive matters of security in the Middle East and the bare-knuckle, backroom dealings of his home state.
Menendez was charged with steering aid and weapons to Egypt, using his clout to help the government of Qatar and propping up Hana’s lucrative halal certification business monopoly for meat sold in Egypt. Hana, in a text to an Egyptian general, referred to Menendez, who held sway over U.S. military sales, financing and other aid, as “our man.”
Prosecutors also cited evidence showing that Menendez tried to disrupt criminal investigations in New Jersey on behalf of two allies — Daibes, a real estate developer, and Jose Uribe, a former insurance broker — who helped funnel bribes to the senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez.
Nadine Menendez, 57, was indicted with her husband but was not tried with him. In April, Stein postponed her trial after her lawyers said she would be undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She has pleaded not guilty.
In the scheme, Nadine Menendez was the senator’s “go-between, demanding payment, receiving payment and passing messages, but always — always — keeping him informed,” a prosecutor, Paul Monteleoni, said in a closing argument at the senator’s trial.
“It wasn’t enough for him to be one of the most powerful people in Washington,” Monteleoni told the jury. “No, Robert Menendez wanted all that power, but he also wanted to use it to pile up riches for himself and his wife.
“So Menendez sold the power of his office,” Monteleoni added.
When the FBI raided the Menendezes’ home in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, in June 2022, agents found bars of gold bullion worth more than $100,000 and about $480,000 in cash, the evidence showed. They also found, parked in the driveway, a 2019 Mercedes-Benz convertible Uribe had given to Nadine Menendez.
Menendez has proclaimed his innocence ever since he was charged. In January, he delivered a defiant speech on the floor of the Senate, calling the case against him “baseless” and saying it had set a dangerous precedent that could be used against other senators.
During the senator’s trial, his lawyers largely sought to shift blame for his troubles to his wife. In an opening statement to the jury, his lawyer, Weitzman, cast her as an opportunist in dire financial straits who had kept her husband “in the dark” about what she was asking others to give her, and who “tried to get cash and assets any which way she could.”
The other lawyer, Fee, in a closing argument said the government’s case had been based on half-truths, factual leaps, unsupported inference and guesses.
“The gaps you are being asked to fill are not based on evidence,” Fee said.
In court Tuesday, as the jury foreperson announced the verdict, repeating “guilty” over and over again, Menendez leaned forward, elbows on the table in front of him, chin resting on his clasped hands. Later, after the jury was discharged and the packed courtroom cleared, Menendez quietly stood up, picked up a large folder holding documents and walked out.

Giuliani's Assets at Risk After Case Is Dismissed: [National Desk]

Full text: Without the protection of Chapter 11, the former mayor and Trump lawyer could have his assets seized and sold by creditors.
Rudolph W. Giuliani is free from the demands -- and protections -- of bankruptcy court. A federal judge dismissed his case on Friday, citing the former New York mayor's failure to comply with almost any of the court's requirements.
Mr. Giuliani, the onetime personal lawyer to former President Donald J. Trump, filed for bankruptcy protection in December after a federal jury in Washington decided he should pay $ 148 million to two Georgia election workers he defamed after the 2020 election. In total, he owes about $ 153 million to 20 people and businesses.
Filing for bankruptcy under the Chapter 11 code protected Mr. Giuliani from having his creditors coming after his assets and pursuing lawsuits. But bankruptcy also required that he disclose his assets and details about his businesses.
"The record in this case reflects Mr. Giuliani's continued failure to meet his reporting obligations and provide the financial transparency required of a debtor in possession," Sean H. Lane, the bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York who oversaw the case, said in his dismissal order.
Here is a look at what comes next, now that Mr. Guiliani's creditors are free to go after his estate.
Mr. Giuliani owes money to at least 20 people and entities.
Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss became the focus of a torrent of attacks and threats after the 2020 election because Mr. Giuliani spread lies about them cheating when they counted votes in Fulton County, Ga. They are the two creditors who come first in making Mr. Giuliani pay. Not only are they owed far more than anyone else, but they also have a court judgment stating that Mr. Giuliani must pay them.
Other creditors include Noelle Dunphy, a former employee of Mr. Giuliani's who claims he harassed and assaulted her. She has sued Mr. Giuliani in a Manhattan state court, and the case will continue now that he is no longer in bankruptcy. Dominion Voting Systems has also filed a lawsuit against Mr. Giuliani, accusing him of spreading lies about the company after the 2020 election.
Mr. Giuliani also owes back taxes to New York and money to law firms that have represented him. He is in debt with several credit card companies; two golf clubs in Florida, including one owned by Mr. Trump; and the condominium association for his apartment in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Giuliani says he has nearly $ 11 million in assets.
Much of the $ 11 million represents the condos he owns in New York and Palm Beach. His New York property is on the market for $ 5.7 million. His home in Palm Beach is estimated to be worth around $ 3.5 million.
He has also said he has $ 30,000 worth of jewelry, including three World Series rings from the New York Yankees. But his creditors think that he is undervaluing those pieces. They have said the rings alone are worth about $ 15,000 each. He also has a 1980 Mercedes-Benz worth $ 25,000.
Mr. Giuliani disclosed that he owns stock in Uber, but said he did not know how much. He also told the court he has a signed Reggie Jackson picture and a signed Yankees stadium picture, but he said he did not know their value.
Next comes a flurry of paperwork.
Mr. Giuliani must sell his assets to pay off his debts. First up will be his New York condo. If he refuses, Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss can pursue a lien to force his hand. The women will also be in the position to choose whether they want to ask local authorities to seize Mr. Guiliani's belongings and sell them at auction.
The creditors who have not yet sued Mr. Giuliani can file claims in state courts. Others can move forward with their lawsuits after a nearly seven-month pause put in place because of the bankruptcy filing.
Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss can also seek information from people who might know whether Mr. Giuliani has any hidden assets, such as a bank account he did not disclose.
"If Mr. Giuliani tries to hide his assets, my clients can and will go after anyone who hides things for him," said Rachel Strickland, a lawyer for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss. "This formerly famous grifter will now have to face the music."
Judge Lane said Mr. Giuliani could not file for bankruptcy protection again for at least a year. This will give his creditors some time to collect their debts from him before any new proceedings put the process on hold again.
There is no end in sight to the legal fees.
Mr. Giuliani faces multiple lawsuits, plus criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election while working as Mr. Trump's lawyer.
In a mass email just a few hours ahead of Judge Lane's dismissal order, Mr. Giuliani asked supporters to donate to his defense fund. He said the goal was to raise $ 231,375.70. He chose that number because it is the booking number he was assigned when he turned himself in for the racketeering case against him in Fulton County. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump and his allies are being charged there for their efforts to try to overturn the state's 2020 election results.
Mr. Giuliani never disclosed to the bankruptcy court how much had been donated to the fund. In a bankruptcy filing earlier this year, the fund's trustee -- a former aide to Mr. Giuliani -- said the funds had been raised from hundreds of donors. Most are contributions between $ 5 and $ 100. It also received a contribution of $ 25,000, but the trustee did not disclose the name of the donor.

Jury Begins Deliberations As Menendez Awaits Fate: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez is charged with 16 separate crimes, including bribery, obstructing justice and acting as an agent of a foreign government.
The Manhattan jury in Senator Robert Menendez's corruption trial began its deliberations Friday on a raft of federal charges in what prosecutors describe as a complex and yearslong bribery conspiracy.
A third-term Democrat who represents New Jersey, Mr. Menendez is accused of steering aid to Egypt, applying political pressure to preserve a friend's business monopoly and meddling in criminal investigations in exchange for bribes of gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz.
The jurors were sent home shortly after 5 p.m. without reaching a verdict and were to resume deliberations on Monday. Mr. Menendez, 70, left the courthouse, telling reporters, "I have faith in God, and in the jury."
On Thursday, the senator sat at the defense table with his lawyers, and leaned back in a chair, hands clasped on his lap, as a prosecutor offered an hourslong rebuttal to frequently impassioned closing arguments by lawyers for the senator and two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who are being tried with him.
In his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, took direct aim at a pillar of the senator's defense strategy -- an effort to shift blame to his wife, Nadine Menendez, 57.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers had told the jury that Ms. Menendez was in dire financial straits early in their relationship and kept her husband "in the dark" about what she was asking others, like Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes, to give her.
"Are you going to accept that there was a secret plan to dupe Senator Menendez," Mr. Richenthal asked the jury, "that his wife cooked up a scheme to secretly collect money and gold by invoking his name with two men, one of whom was his close friend, and he never learned about it?"
"Because let's be clear about what that means," Mr. Richenthal said. "It means that she duped her husband -- her boyfriend and now husband -- an experienced public official, one of the most powerful people in the entire U.S. Congress for five years."
"He knows all about the payments," Mr. Richenthal said. "He's taking actions, he's part of it."
Ms. Menendez, who last year was indicted with her husband in the bribery case and has pleaded not guilty, is not being tried with him. Her trial was postponed because she is being treated for breast cancer.
Mr. Menendez, Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes are charged in a 66-page federal indictment that includes 18 counts, not all of which apply to each defendant. Mr. Menendez faces 16 counts, including bribery, conspiracy, obstructing justice, extortion and acting as an agent of a foreign government -- a charge never before leveled against a U.S. senator.
Throughout the trial, the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, has complimented the jurors on their punctuality and attentiveness during weeks of sometimes tedious testimony about evidence charts, the life span of a dollar bill, Egypt's import market, and the process for allocating foreign military aid.
In sometimes soaring rhetoric, the lawyers and prosecutors, who began delivering closing arguments on Monday, echoed the judge's words, reminding the jurors of the import of the decisions they were being asked to render.
"What makes this system that you now have spent quite some time existing in so special," Adam Fee, one of Mr. Menendez's lawyers, said, "is that everyone -- the powerful, the powerless -- have one thing standing between them and a lifetime of shame, a conviction: a jury."
The six-woman, six-man jury is racially diverse and varies in age. The two youngest jurors are 27 and 28; the two oldest are 65 and 68.
Many hold advanced degrees, according to responses given during the jury-selection process. The panel includes a doctor who works at a New York City hospital, a mother of a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old, and an investment banker.
On Friday, shortly before 1 p.m., Judge Stein finished instructing the jury on the law. He then said he had been informed that the 12 jurors and five alternate jurors, who had sat with them throughout the two-month trial as potential backups, had asked to eat one last lunch together as a group, before the 12 went in to deliberate.
"That's perfectly fine," the judge said, "except you can't start deliberating now because there are going to be 17 of you there."
Then, after lunch, around 2 p.m., the jury began its deliberations.

Biden Offers $1.7 Billion To Factories in 8 States To Build Electric Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A Jeep plant that closed last year will be among those that will benefit from federal grants meant to help automotive manufacturers and protect jobs.
The federal government will grant car and auto parts factories in eight states $ 1.7 billion to begin producing electric vehicles and other clean energy technology, the Biden administration announced on Thursday.
Among the 11 recipients will be a Jeep factory in Belvidere, Ill., that the brand's parent company Stellantis closed last year. The money will allow the plant to reopen and produce electric vehicles, officials said, restoring almost 1,450 jobs.
Other beneficiaries include a factory in Georgia that plans to make Blue Bird electric school buses, a General Motors factory in Michigan that will shift production from gasoline to electric vehicles, and a Harley-Davidson factory in Pennsylvania that will increase production of electric motorcycles.
The funding helps to address fears that electric vehicles will endanger jobs at factories that make gasoline-powered vehicles or parts for internal combustion engines as the industry shifts to E.V.s. To qualify for the money, companies had to commit to retraining their existing workers.
Employees at all of the factories chosen are represented by unions. Officials said they gave priority to communities that suffered disproportionately from pollution or lack of investment.
Several of the factories are in Pennsylvania, Michigan or Georgia, states where narrow margins will determine the outcome of the presidential election. President Biden, in a statement, sought to contrast his industrial policies with those of former President Donald J. Trump.
"This delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor," Mr. Biden said.
A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt, said the Biden administration was doing the bidding of "environmental extremists who are trying to implement the most radical energy agenda in history and force Americans to purchase electric vehicles they can't afford while shipping our great American auto industry to China."
The funds will preserve 15,000 jobs and create almost 3,000 new ones, Jennifer Granholm, the energy secretary, said on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. In a reference to China, she said the money will allow the United States to "compete with other countries who were subsidizing their auto industries."
The awards will draw on funds allocated by the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats in Congress in 2022. The legislation provided subsidies that have fed a boom in construction of electric vehicle factories and battery plants.
Some automakers, including Ford Motor and Mercedes-Benz, have recently slowed their investments in electric vehicle manufacturing because demand has not grown as fast as they had expected. But industry analysts expect sales of electric vehicles to pick up as prices fall and more chargers become available. Affordability and charging are the biggest concerns for car buyers interested in electric vehicles, surveys show.
There are signs that consumer appetite for battery-powered cars is increasing. Sales of electric vehicles in the United States climbed 11.3 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, Cox Automotive, which tracks the industry, said Tuesday. Americans bought or leased more than 330,000 electric cars and light trucks during the quarter, accounting for 8 percent of all new cars sold or leased in the three-month period.
The German automaker BMW said Wednesday it delivered 180,000 electric BMWs worldwide in the first six months of the year, a 34 percent increase from the same period a year earlier.
Companies receiving the federal awards announced on Thursday will also be able to use the money to produce plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have both electric and gasoline motors, and other zero-emission technology such as hydrogen fuel cells.
Before they can receive the money, companies must negotiate agreements with the Department of Energy that will obligate them to meet investment and employment targets, and to provide workers with benefits like training, child care and pensions.
The grants "are not blank checks to corporations," Julie Su, the acting secretary of labor, said. "They should uplift entire communities and maintain high wage jobs."
The awards include a $ 32.6 million grant to a U.S. subsidiary of Hyundai Mobis, a Korean auto parts maker, which will convert a Toledo, Ohio, plant to make chassis for plug-in hybrid vehicles and battery systems. And $ 500 million will go to G.M., which will convert a plant in Lansing, Mich., from producing gasoline cars to electric models.
The Jeep factory in Illinois will receive $ 334.8 million and another Stellantis operation, a transmission plant in Kokomo, Ind., will get $ 250 million to help it make components for electric vehicles.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez's lawyers finished a six-hour closing statement on Wednesday afternoon.
During a closing argument that stretched for nearly six hours over two days, a lawyer for Senator Robert Menendez tried to take apart the vast and complicated case that prosecutors spent weeks building against his client, calling it "painfully thin."
Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is being tried alongside two businessmen, has been indicted on 16 felony counts, including bribery, extortion, obstruction of justice, acting as a foreign agent and conspiracy.
Prosecutors have shown jurors hundreds of text messages, emails, bank records and photographs of nearly half a million dollars in cash and gold bars that were found in the Englewood Cliffs, N.J., home of Mr. Menendez, 70, and his wife Nadine, 57. The couple received the gifts between 2018 and 2022 in exchange for political favors, the government says.
But Adam Fee, one of Mr. Menendez's lawyers, said in a closing argument on Wednesday that prosecutors had failed to connect any of that evidence to an act of bribery or corruption. Mr. Menendez's actions, such as calling government officials about investigations involving constituents or pushing for aid to Egypt, were part of his job.
"This case, it dies here today," Mr. Fee said. "Because they have failed to prove that very high standard that Bob's actions were anything other than what we want our elected officials to do."
Mr. Fee finished his marathon closing argument just before the lunchtime break, testing the patience of jurors, who had also withstood a five-hour summation from prosecutors.
Jurors had arrived looking alert and refreshed on Wednesday morning, but as the closing argument went on, some appeared to grow fatigued and restless.
Some fidgeted. Others looked at the clock. One juror's eyes were closed.Mr. Menendez expressed confidence in his defense team as he left Federal District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon.
"We have stripped away the government's false narratives and exposed their lies," he told reporters.
Since May 13, Mr. Menendez and his two co-defendants, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, have sat in Courtroom 23A in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where prosecutors have outlined a large-scale bribery scheme. They accused the senator of using his position to aid Mr. Daibes with a bank fraud investigation against him and to help Mr. Hana protect a halal meat certification monopoly he received from the Egyptian government, among other favors.
At the center of that scheme, the government says, was Ms. Menendez, who was friends with both Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer and a longtime ally of the senator. Federal prosecutors have portrayed her as an eager go-between, who texted and arranged meetings with Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes in order to shield Mr. Menendez from suspicion.
In their opening statements, Mr. Menendez's lawyers shifted the blame to Ms. Menendez, casting her as an opportunist who took advantage of the fact that she and the senator lived largely separate lives to hide her financial problems and desire for luxuries from him. Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes were not seeking political favors, according to the defense. They were helping her get cash and assets "any which way she could" as she kept Mr. Menendez "in the dark."
Ms. Menendez was also charged, but her trial has been postponed because she is undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She has pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Menendez's strategy of blaming his wife risked turning off jurors, according to legal observers, and prosecutors accused the defense in their closing of making Ms. Menendez a scapegoat.
By the end of the trial, Mr. Menendez's lawyers had softened their descriptions of Ms. Menendez. In his closing, Mr. Fee called her a "vulnerable" woman who had not worked for years and in 2018 was trying to get out of an abusive, overlapping relationship with another man, which briefly derailed her relationship with the senator.
When they got back together the next year, she kept her financial troubles from Mr. Menendez out of fear of losing him again, Mr. Fee said.
"She was trying to present an image that would make Bob stay with her," Mr. Fee said. "This is not us shifting blame to anyone. This is the truth."
During his closing, Paul M. Monteleoni, one of the federal prosecutors, reminded jurors of testimony by Jose Uribe, a former insurance broker who said that he agreed to buy Ms. Menendez a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible in exchange for the senator's help quashing a state investigation into Mr. Uribe's trucking company.
During his testimony, Mr. Uribe, who has pleaded guilty, described a meeting in the patio of the Menendezes' home, when, he said, the senator rang a bell to call Ms. Menendez outside.
"He's not a puppet having his strings pulled by someone that he summons with a bell," Mr. Monteleoni said during his closing argument on Tuesday.
In his closing, Mr. Fee said the senator had no knowledge of the agreement between his wife and Mr. Uribe, whom he described as a liar who took advantage of Ms. Menendez's desperation.
Mr. Uribe wanted a meeting with Mr. Menendez in exchange for the Mercedes, which he got, but by Mr. Uribe's own admission, there was never a conversation about a quid pro quo, Mr. Fee said. "His testimony doesn't stand up," Mr. Fee said. "He helped disprove the charges."
Mr. Fee mentioned other government witnesses who, he argued, ended up helping Mr. Menendez's case. Philip R. Sellinger, New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, said he never felt Mr. Menendez was asking him to do "anything unethical or improper" when he talked to him about a criminal case against Mr. Daibes, Mr. Fee reminded jurors. And Ted McKinney, an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Menendez never threatened him or intimidated him during a brief phone call about Mr. Hana's meat monopoly.
Mr. Uribe, Mr. Fee said, was another witness whom prosecutors called but who ended up helping Mr. Menendez's case.
The defense doesn't have the burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt, Mr. Fee said. "They do. But the evidence is on our side."
In his closing, Lawrence Lustberg, Mr. Hana's lawyer, said his client and Ms. Menendez had a rocky but close friendship -- they took care of each other through illnesses, sent each other holiday cards and gave each other gifts.
The government failed to show that Mr. Hana had gotten anything in return for such gifts, a key element of proving bribery, Mr. Lustberg said. For example, he said, it was up to the Egyptian government, not Mr. Menendez, whether Mr. Hana kept his certification monopoly.
"Not every action is criminal," Mr. Lustberg said. "Not every gift is a bribe."
He also noted that Mr. Hana fired Ms. Menendez from a consulting job he had given her -- a $ 10,000-a-month position that prosecutors said was part of the bribery scheme.
But Ms. Menendez had scoffed at working eight hours a day and eventually Mr. Hana let her go, Mr. Lustberg said, asking the jury to consider whether those were the actions of someone engaged in bribery.
César de Castro, Mr. Daibes's lawyer, gave the last defense closing. He described Mr. Daibes as "an extremely generous" businessman with no children who gave gifts of gold and cash loans to friends.
Mr. Menendez had been a friend of Mr. Daibes for more than 30 years and the developer had given the senator and his wife similar gifts to "cultivate" that friendship, Mr. de Castro said.
"You don't bribe a close friend," he said. Adam Fee, a lawyer for Senator Robert Menendez, told jurors "the evidence is on our side." (PHOTOGRAPH BY JEFFERSON SIEGEL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page A15.

Art Finds Its Way Into a New Arena: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the $ 2 billion home of the Los Angeles Clippers, Intuit Dome, opens next month with a concert by Bruno Mars, visitors to the 18,000-seat arena will not only be greeted by an enormous double-sided LED scoreboard, an outdoor community basketball court and food choices ranging from vegan cauliflower wraps to dulce de leche churros.
They will also encounter about $ 11 million worth of ambitious, immense and site-specific artworks that have been commissioned from seven artists with Los Angeles connections.
Sculpture, murals and digital art installations by artists including Refik Anadol, Jennifer Steinkamp, Charles Gaines and Glenn Kaino will be on view throughout the campus of the privately funded new home of the N.B.A.'s Clippers.
The artists involved said they liked the idea of reaching people outside a conventional context. "l believe art should be for anyone and anywhere," said Anadol, whose A.I.-driven digital artwork, "Living Arena," is displayed on an LED screen 40 feet tall by 70 feet wide. "Museums and galleries are so last century. I don't think there are any more borders."
The Intuit Dome is the latest sports arena or stadium to embrace art with its hot dogs and beer, a move intended in part to make the spaces more appealing as rental venues when the resident teams aren't playing. SoFi Stadium, also in Inglewood, which is home to the N.F.L.'s Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, last year presented a pair of exhibitions focused on African-American art and history. Other stadiums that prominently feature art include AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where the Dallas Cowboys and Anish Kapoor's "Sky Mirror" reside, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home to the Atlanta Falcons and a more than 73,000-pound avian sculpture by Gabor Miklos Szoke called "Rise Up."
The Clippers say the art program -- which includes another 40-plus pieces, budgeted at an additional approximately $ 3 million -- represents an effort to connect with Los Angeles and support the city's artists.
"We talked extensively with the community about what really mattered to them, and public art was something that we really wanted to have more of," said Gillian Zucker, the chief executive of Halo Sports and Entertainment, the Clippers' parent company, on a recent walk through the stadium.
"This is a global opportunity to really showcase artists," she added. "That's a big part of the spirit of this building -- looking at the community around us."
The Los Angeles art world has welcomed the effort. "Some of the most moving experiences people have with art are when they don't expect to see it," said Johanna Burton, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art. "When you run into art in the world, there is a different kind of reaction that's possible."
The commissioning process was led by Ruth Berson, an art consultant who had previously served as the deputy director of curatorial affairs at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. There was no competition. Instead, with the help of an advisory group of curators, art historians and community members, Berson and the Clippers organization sought out artists that she said had a connection to Los Angeles by birth, education or residency; who "were at the top of their game"; and who knew how to scale, knowing that "these pieces would be enormous."
Berson added that they wanted artists "who were really involved with the civic life of a place and who understood about community and knew that the audience for this would not necessarily be, you know, the art cognoscenti," she said. "Inglewood is a place that has lots and lots of artist studios but doesn't have a museum. So there was just some opportunity here to bring something that we didn't already have."
The artists were shown a 3-D model of the Intuit Dome and its plaza and encouraged to identify a site where they would want to create a work. They then proposed initial ideas, which were meant to "express the sense of community, creativity, and joy," Berson said, adding that the commissioned art will remain in place for at least 25 years.
(Negotiations with Kehinde Wiley for a commission never came to fruition because of significant delays over two years, unrelated to recent allegations of sexual harassment against the artist, according to a spokesman for the Intuit Dome.)
Greeting visitors at the main entrance to Intuit Dome is the sculpture "Sails" by Glenn Kaino. His piece -- made of concrete, stainless steel and wood -- evokes a clipper ship with a basketball theme, its sails made of backboards and hoops. In research he did for the piece, Kaino said he looked at photographs of backboards all over the world where "people were playing the sport however they could."
"I was inspired by the idea that basketball is such a wind behind cultural sails," Kaino added. "I thought about honoring the global connectivity of basketball and also the delightful ingenuity that people have in their determination to play."
The entire surface of the Intuit Dome, designed by AECOM and inspired by the form of a basketball net as the ball passes through it, serves as the backdrop for Jennifer Steinkamp's digital artwork "Swoosh." Five distinct animations, playing on different nights, weave around the structure's geometric panels, alluding to natural forces like wind and gravity.
"It's intriguing to make this building feel emotional," Steinkamp said. "We're pushing the limit here by animating the entire surface. When the Clippers win a game, the building becomes excited."
Bordering the Intuit Dome's plaza, behind the campus's outdoor community basketball court, is the artwork by Anadol, a media artist who has helped pioneer the aesthetics of data and machine intelligence.
For the dome, Anadol's piece, created with artificial intelligence algorithms, presents a continually changing data narrative in four chapters: "Urban Dreams," featuring flight information from nearby LAX and other airports; "Nature Dreams," displaying live weather data from Inglewood including wind direction, temperature and humidity; "Culture Dreams," showcasing player tracking data from historic Clippers games; and "California Landscape," highlighting images from the state's national parks.
"I hope it is inspiring for society to think and look and meditate," Anadol said.
Across the plaza from Anadol's screen, Patrick Martinez created a glowing neon sculpture, "Same Boat," that is about nine feet square and reproduces a statement by the civil rights leader Whitney M. Young: "We may have all come on different ships but we're in the same boat now."
Martinez said his sign was inspired by Los Angeles storefronts -- laundromats, pawn shops, notaries. "They were like messages speaking to the passer-by," he said. "I like the idea of building a bridge to the person who doesn't typically go to a museum or the person who doesn't typically go to see sports."
On a wall adjacent to Martinez's sculpture, Kyungmi Shin -- who works frequently in large-scale photo collage -- contributed a glass mosaic "Spring to Life" measuring 22.75 feet by 7.5 feet, with stainless steel tracery that outlines the silhouettes of basketball players -- including Jerry West, who died last month, the Hall of Fame guard for the Los Angeles Lakers whose profile graces the N.B.A.'s logo. The mosaic also depicts Centinela Springs, the South Los Angeles water source that once supported the Tongva people.
"I just wanted to address the positive aspect of basketball and engage with the site," Shin said.
Gaines -- himself a tennis and soccer fan -- is still working on the concept for his commission, which will occupy a large wall at the entrance to the arena. He said he liked the idea of having art that is integral to the architecture, such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis by Eero Saarinen or Tom Bradley International Terminal in Los Angeles, which features a monumental Mark Bradford sculpture.
"It gives that site a very particular fingerprint," Gaines said, adding that, while his work is still being designed, "it will be a reflection on an important part of Inglewood's history and/or culture."
Last, "Cultural Playground," a Michael Massenburg mural installed on three exterior walls of the Dome's Team Store building, features basketball, tennis and soccer players as well as singers, musicians, and dancers set in locations ranging from Inglewood's Fox Theater to Chinatown.
Berson said Massenburg's piece reflects "what the Dome is intended to do, which is to be "a place for joy, a place for play, a place for the community to interact."
Massenburg said he is pleased that his piece, "will be the first visual people will see as they drive down the street."
"It gets people to look," he added, "and say, 'What's that on the wall?"'

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — When the $2 billion home of the Los Angeles Clippers, Intuit Dome, opens next month with a concert by Bruno Mars, visitors to the 18,000-seat arena will not only be greeted by an enormous double-sided LED scoreboard, an outdoor community basketball court and food choices ranging from vegan cauliflower wraps to dulce de leche churros.

Full text: A new report estimates that the company led by Elon Musk accounted for just under half of all battery-powered vehicles sold in the second quarter of the year.
Tesla's once-commanding share of the market for electric vehicles in the United States slipped below 50 percent in the second quarter of the year even as sales of battery-powered cars surged to a record, according to new estimates published Tuesday by a research firm.
Tesla accounted for 49.7 percent of electric vehicles sales from April through June, down from 59.3 percent a year earlier as the company led by Elon Musk lost ground to General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Kia, the research firm, Cox Automotive said. It was the first time the company's market share fell below 50 percent in a quarter, according to Cox. The firm, a leading auto industry researcher, estimates market share based on registrations, company reports and other data.
The numbers are the latest sign that Tesla is losing its dominance in a market it in effect created in 2012 when it introduced the Model S sedan. Before that car, very few electric vehicles were sold in the United States. Overall, U.S. electric vehicle sales climbed 11.3 percent from a year earlier, suggesting that consumer demand for the technology remains healthy even if sales are no longer growing at more than 40 percent a year as they were last year. Americans bought or leased more than 330,000 electric cars and light trucks during the quarter, accounting for 8 percent of all new cars sold or leased in the three-month period. A year earlier, electric vehicles accounted for 7.2 percent of the market, Cox said.
A few years ago Tesla didn't have many competitors, and pretty much no other company could match its cars' driving range on a full charge or acceleration. But established carmakers have been introducing electric vehicles that can travel 300 miles or more, equaling and sometimes exceeding the capabilities of Tesla's cars.
There are well over 100 electric models available in the United States, according to a separate report published Tuesday by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group. Prices have fallen as the supply and variety of models have increased, making it possible for more people to afford one.
Intense competition "is leading to continued price pressure, helping push E.V. adoption slowly higher," Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox, said in a statement.
Many consumers are now buying electric cars from established carmakers like BMW or Ford, which have large dealer networks that can provide maintenance and repairs. Tesla sells cars online and many consumers have said that it can be hard to get their cars repaired at the company's relatively small network of service centers.
Tesla sales have also suffered from an aging lineup. Its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, went on sale in 2020, making it dated by industry standards. Hyundai and its sister company, Kia, offer more electric models than Tesla, with competitive prices and newer designs.
After a slow start in the last couple of years, G.M. has recently begun rolling out vehicles designed to be electric, rather than models converted from gasoline cars. The company is also now using batteries made in the United States in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution. In a few months, G.M. is expected to start selling an electric version of G.M.'s Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle for around $ 35,000 before taking into account a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.
Tesla said last week that its global sales fell 4.8 percent, to around 444,000, in the second quarter from the period a year ago. The company does not break out its sales by country, but Cox estimates that Tesla's U.S. sales fell 6.3 percent in the second quarter, to 164,000 cars.
Mr. Musk may have also hurt Tesla sales with his embrace of right-wing politics on X, the social media platform he owns. Electric vehicle owners tend to be liberal or left-leaning and electric vehicle sales are highest in states that generally elect Democrats for statewide and federal offices.
In recent quarters, sales of electric vehicles have not grown as fast as some automakers had expected, but the market is still expanding faster than the one for gasoline vehicles. The market for hybrid vehicles has lately been growing even faster than for fully electric vehicles; hybrids, which do not have to be plugged in, allow consumers to avoid a patchy national public charging network.
Not all carmakers are benefiting. Electric models including Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Porsche and Volvo fell in the second quarter from a year earlier, Cox said. The firm said it would publish detailed sales and market share figures on Thursday.
Tesla is now facing competition from more than 100 electric models, which has driven prices down as well. (PHOTOGRAPH BY LAUREN JUSTICE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B5.

Powerful New Jersey Democrat Pleads Not Guilty to Racketeering: [National Desk]

Full text: George E. Norcross III, a widely feared political figure in New Jersey for years, is accused of manipulating property deals to benefit from government tax breaks.
George E. Norcross III, a longtime kingmaker in New Jersey politics, on Tuesday denied criminal charges that he had manipulated property deals to benefit from millions of dollars in government tax breaks.
"My client emphatically states he is not guilty," Mr. Norcross's lawyer, Michael Critchley, told Superior Court Judge Peter E. Warshaw Jr. at the Mercer County Courthouse in Trenton, where his client was arraigned.
Mr. Norcross and five co-defendants were named in a 13-count racketeering indictment unsealed last month. They are accused of unlawfully obtaining property and development rights along the Delaware River waterfront of Camden, a Philadelphia suburb that for decades ranked among the nation's poorest and most violent cities.
Four other defendants also pleaded not guilty. The fifth, whose lawyer was involved in a proceeding out of state, will be arraigned in August. None spoke in court.
Judge Warshaw set a 60-day window for prosecutors to give some grand jury materials to the defense. The state has said the evidence, amounting to thousands of pages, plus audio and images, contains sensitive information that could imperil confidential witnesses.
Mr. Norcross, 68, a career insurance executive, emerged as a powerful Democratic fund-raiser in the early 1990s, without ever holding elective office. Backed by a network of allies whom he helped send to the State Legislature, Mr. Norcross cast himself as Camden's savior. In a landscape of industrial blight, he envisioned gleaming campuses for the life sciences, biotechnology and manufacturing industries in the city of his birth.
At the heart of Mr. Norcross's advocacy, though, wasn't high-minded civic duty but a 12-year scheme of personal greed, according to Matthew J. Platkin, the New Jersey attorney general. Together, the defendants conspired to influence government officials, develop the Camden waterfront and collect government-issued tax breaks that shaved millions of dollars off project costs, state prosecutors have said.
Also charged with racketeering in the first degree were Mr. Norcross's brother, Philip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, the chief executive of a Camden-based law firm; Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, N.J., a former Camden mayor; William M. Tambussi, 66, of Brigantine, N.J., George Norcross's longtime personal lawyer; Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, the chief executive of NFI, a trucking and logistics company; and John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pa., an executive of the Michaels Organization, a residential development company.
All entered not guilty pleas through their lawyers, except Mr. Brown, whose lawyer was out of state. The crime is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
When Mr. Platkin announced the charges at a news conference in Trenton on June 17, he said that Mr. Norcross had led a "criminal enterprise" that "took the Camden waterfront all for themselves."
As Mr. Platkin spoke, Mr. Norcross, who now lives in Florida, was seated in the front row, uninvited.
The charges against him were another mark on New Jersey's blemished political reputation. The state's senior U.S. senator, Robert Menendez, is in his ninth week of a corruption trial, charged by federal prosecutors with accepting cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for doling out favors for allies.
Mr. Norcross gained notoriety by donating to political campaigns and assembling an ironclad voting bloc of South Jersey lawmakers. Mr. Norcross's allies were instrumental in selecting governors, steering bills through the Legislature and influencing state policy.
He formed alliances that often blurred the lines between the Democratic and Republican parties. Until 2021 he was a member of the Democratic National Committee. For years he was both a close friend of the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and a member of former President Donald J. Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.
About a year ago, Mr. Norcross suggested he was stepping back from politics after a series of legislative defeats. His public statements coincided with news reports that the attorney general's office had revived its investigation into more than a billion dollars in tax breaks awarded to South Jersey companies through legislation backed by former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and close ally of Mr. Norcross.
Outside the courthouse on Tuesday, Mr. Critchley said Mr. Platkin was engaged in a "jihad." The indictment, he said, "does not have elements of crime." He dismissed salty language attributed to Mr. Norcross in the indictment as "hard bargaining" during a business transaction -- hardly against the law.
Mr. Norcross stood alongside Mr. Critchley, at times flashing a broad smile. He stood silently in a navy suit, French-cuffed white shirt, green tie and black tassel loafers. Though reporters asked him questions, he didn't respond, and Mr. Critchley said his client would have no comment.

Ferrari Enters the Age of Electrification, but Will It Vroom?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gliding on robotic haulers, a line of Ferrari frames maneuvers through a gleaming new factory in Northern Italy. At each station, engineers in cherry red uniforms add a component -- an engine block, a dashboard, a steering wheel -- as they transform the bodies into hybrid vehicles. Up next: fully electric.
A lot is riding on Ferrari's 200-million-euro "e-building," which went into operation last month and is nearly twice the size of Rome's Colosseum. The factory is intended to bring the 77-year-old sports-car maker, known for the sonorous vroom of its gas engines, into the age of electrification.
But the effort comes at a precarious time for the auto industry. The transition to electric vehicles, which was supposed to quickly usher in an era of climate-friendly transport, has instead been squeezed by costly investments and slowing global demand.
Other luxury carmakers have struggled to go electric. Mercedes-Benz and Lamborghini have reduced their ambitions. Tesla reported declining second-quarter sales on Tuesday, and Ford Motor said in April that it would shift production to more hybrids as E.V. losses piled up. A growing trade war between China and the West also threatens to stifle growth.
Despite the challenges, Ferrari sees an opportunity in the industry's inevitable march toward electrification to reach a new consumer: the wealthy environmentalist. It intends to unveil its first fully electric model in the fourth quarter of next year. As part of its strategy, the carmaker has enlisted LoveFrom -- the agency founded by Jony Ive, Apple's former design chief, and the industrial designer Marc Newson -- to hone the car's appearance.
There is plenty of mystery shrouding the yet-to-be-named car, including its battery life and what it will sound like. The company has not disclosed its look, production run or price tag. But it could be one of the most expensive electric vehicles on the market, analyst say, surpassing Porsche's $ 286,000 Taycan Turbo GT.
Ferrari's foray into electric will be notable for other reasons. Regulators may be pushing electric vehicles, but there is lingering skepticism in the marketplace. Winning over fans of combustion engines will not be easy -- even for Ferrari. And the industry is desperate for an automaker, any automaker, to prove that electric vehicles can drive big profits.
"It's worth watching whether a Ferrari E.V. can maintain the kind of price premium you'd associate with a Ferrari," said Martino de Ambroggi, an automotive analyst at Equita, an investment bank in Milan. "Often, a Ferrari purchase is also viewed as a kind of investment. Only after a few years will we see if that investment in an electric Ferrari holds up."
Benedetto Vigna, Ferrari's chief executive, is doing his best to keep the market in anticipation. In an interview last month in the new plant, he said the company would commence full-scale electric vehicle production by early 2026. By 2030, electric and hybrid cars will make up as much as 80 percent of Ferrari's annual output as the company seeks to meet stringent European Union emissions mandates.
In the meantime, the e-building will roll out two models: the SF90 Stradale, a plug-in hybrid, and the combustion engine Purosangue.
Ferrari does not need an electric vehicle to pad its bottom line. Under Mr. Vigna, a former executive at the chip maker STMicroelectronics who took the helm nearly three years ago, the company has been on a tear. The stock is one of the best performers in Europe this year, giving it a roughly $ 75 billion market valuation, higher than that of Ford or General Motors. Profits are soaring alongside prices at Ferrari, which makes some of the most expensive cars on the planet. There's a three-year waiting list for some models.
Ferrari's success over the years on the Formula 1 track has also led to a lucrative corporate sponsorship and merchandise business that has transformed it into a luxury brand with a sporty flair. Ferrari's prancing horse logo can be found on high-end apparel like a €790 cashmere sweater.
Mr. Vigna sees the electric vehicle as part of the company's growth strategy, despite the industry's slowdown. "There are some potential clients, I have them clearly in mind, who will never become part of the family unless there is an electric car," he said.
But challenges loom. Enthusiasts who had gathered outside the factory gates last month wondered: Will it look, handle and sound like the classic Ferrari growler, or have the understated whine of most electric vehicles?
"When you think of a Ferrari, it still has that kind of engine sensation, and you also think of the roar," Mr. de Ambroggi said. "I don't know how Ferrari resolves this."
Mr. Vigna fields that question often, especially from longtime customers, or Ferraristi. They seem to be channeling the deceased founder, Enzo Ferrari, who once broke down in the simplest terms how he built some of the fastest cars on the planet: "I build motors and attach them to wheels."
Mr. Vigna's E.V. pitch has a different ring. "The electric engine will not be silent," he said. "There are ways to make sure that the emotion comes through from driving an electric Ferrari that is the same as when you drive a hybrid or when you drive a thermal Ferrari."
Battery life is another puzzle piece. Because Ferraris often sell for a higher price on the secondary market, the concern about battery degradation, and its impact on the long-term value of the car, may be felt more acutely by the Ferraristi.
"The E.V. transition raises a whole lot of new issues for them in terms of how you maintain the vehicle," said Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst at Bernstein.
Ferrari's longtime partner, SK On, a South Korean battery maker, will supply the components for the E.V. batteries, which Ferrari will assemble in the e-building, where it will also make the car's electric motors and axles.
And then there is the matter of price. Last month, Reuters reported that the car would cost at least €500,000 ( $ 540,000). Mr. Vigna pushed back on the speculation, saying it is too early to talk price.
Ferrari still follows its founder's principle for producing a limited number of extremely expensive cars. Ferrari made fewer than 14,000 last year; even with the e-building, production is not expected to increase much at the start.
The limited numbers may explain why fans make the pilgrimage to Maranello hoping to catch a glimpse of a Ferrari, either on the company's Formula 1 test track or near its red brick factory.
Knowing demand is high, Mr. Vigna has increased the base price of most models more than 25 percent.
"Ferrari consistently sells less than the market demands, leading to a multiyear order book," said Mr. Reitman, the Bernstein analyst. With a profit margin of nearly 30 percent, Ferrari's business more resembles that of a luxury brand like Hermes or Rolex, analysts say.
Mr. Vigna is already thinking about how to market the new electric car. The target customer probably will not be buying the car for purely practical or even planet-saving reasons, he said, adding: "The emotional part of the brain is driving the purchase."

Menendez Defense Rests Without Senator Testifying: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey is accused of a wide-ranging international bribery conspiracy. Jurors are likely to begin deliberating next week.
After calling just four witnesses, lawyers for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey rested their case late Wednesday afternoon in Manhattan federal court, setting the stage for jurors to begin deliberations in his international bribery conspiracy trial early next week.
Mr. Menendez, 70, said that he decided against testifying in his own defense for two primary reasons.
The government, he said, had not proved its case, and he did not want to give prosecutors an opportunity to rehash the charges twice -- once on cross-examination and again in closing arguments.
That was "simply not something that makes any sense to me whatsoever," Mr. Menendez said as he left the courthouse after proceedings ended for the day.
"I expect my lawyers will produce a powerful and convincing summation, deduce how the evidence came out, where they failed across the board, and have the jury render a verdict of not guilty," he added.
Final summations in the case -- first by prosecutors, then by lawyers for Mr. Menendez and two co-defendants, followed by a government rebuttal -- are likely to begin as early as Monday afternoon, according to the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court.
A lawyer for one of the co-defendants, Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer charged with giving bribes of gold and cash to the senator and his wife, rested his client's case without calling a single witness. Lawyers for the other co-defendant, Wael Hana, who runs a global halal meat certification company based in New Jersey, were expected to call their final witness on Monday morning.
That witness, described in court as a former Egyptian government official who now works for Mr. Hana's company, has been trying to obtain a visa for nearly a month to travel to the United States to testify.
Prosecutors have said that Mr. Menendez exerted pressure on an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help safeguard a lucrative monopoly that Egypt had awarded Mr. Hana's company, IS EG Halal. In return, the company funneled bribes to Mr. Menendez through his wife, Nadine Menendez, according to a federal indictment.
Mr. Menendez's defense case included testimony from two family members -- his older sister, Caridad Gonzalez; and Katia Tabourian, his wife's sister.
Ms. Menendez, 57, has also been charged in the conspiracy. Prosecutors have depicted her as a key go-between and a conduit for bribes that included gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Jurors heard her voice in phone messages and were shown scores of texts she wrote. But she never stepped foot in the courtroom during the trial. Judge Stein postponed her trial after she was diagnosed with breast cancer; Mr. Menendez disclosed during the first week of trial testimony that she was preparing to undergo a mastectomy and might need additional radiation treatment. She has pleaded not guilty.
During the trial, much of Mr. Menendez's defense evolved through vigorous cross-examination of government witnesses, as his lawyers sought to undermine charges that he and his wife took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for the senator's willingness to use his political clout to do favors for friends and the governments of Egypt and Qatar.
The bribery scheme alleged by prosecutors began in February 2018, less than a month after Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, was cleared of charges tied to an unrelated federal corruption case in New Jersey. That case ended in a mistrial in 2017 after jurors were unable to agree on a verdict, and prosecutors decided on Jan. 31, 2018, to drop the remaining charges.
Mr. Menendez also decided against testifying in the 2017 trial, which the jury in the Manhattan case have not been told about.
Since the middle of May, prosecutors have introduced thousands of pieces of evidence, including text, email and voice mail messages that were played aloud in court. The government also questioned more than a dozen witnesses who testified against Mr. Menendez, including a former New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, and the state's top federal prosecutor, Philip R. Sellinger.
Prosecutors have said the senator sought to meddle in criminal matters before their offices on behalf of his allies.
As part of the defense case, Ms. Gonzalez, who is 11 years older than the senator, offered testimony that seemed intended to undermine the government's claim that cash found during a June 2022 F.BI. search of the couple's Englewood Cliffs, N.J., home came from bribes paid to the couple.
Mr. Menendez said after he was indicted last year that he had regularly withdrawn money from his savings account for decades for "emergencies," and that he did so "because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba." His family fled Cuba for the United States in 1951, three years before he was born in New York City.
Ms. Gonzalez, who said she was 8 when the family left Cuba, elaborated in court on her brother's public account, telling the jury that their father had stored money in a false bottom of a grandfather clock and that her mother, a seamstress, hid cash in the door frame of a closet.
"Daddy always said, 'Don't trust the banks. If you trust the banks, you never know what can happen,"' Ms. Gonzalez testified Monday.
After Mr. Menendez's lawyers called their final witness late Wednesday, Judge Stein questioned the senator, out of the jury's view, to make sure he understood the decision whether to testify was his alone. Mr. Menendez said he had discussed the matter "at length" with his lawyers.
Soon, when the jury had returned, Adam Fee, one of his lawyers, announced, "Your honor, that was our last witness, and with that, the defense for Senator Menendez rests."

Menendez's Sister Says His Hoarding of Cash Is a Legacy From Cuba: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez's sister testified that their father stored cash in a grandfather clock in Havana, Cuba.
Senator Robert Menendez's sister testified on Monday about their parents' journey from Cuba and the family's practice of storing cash at home, offering justification for a habit the senator has said explains at least some of the roughly $ 480,000 F.B.I. agents seized during a search of his New Jersey home.
The sister, Caridad Gonzalez, was 8 years old when her family fled Cuba in 1951, three years before Mr. Menendez was born in New York City. She told jurors that their father, a tie manufacturer, stored money in a false bottom of a grandfather clock in their home in Havana.
"It's a Cuban thing," Ms. Gonzalez, who is in her 80s, testified. "They were afraid of losing what they worked so hard for."
She explained that her parents and her aunt continued the practice after arriving in the United States, where her father worked as both a carpenter and a clothing manufacturer.
Her mother, a seamstress, stored money in the door frame of a closet; her father kept cash in a shoe box that he stored on a shelf in a closet. After a fire at their aunt's home, relatives discovered $ 60,000 in a bag in the basement, Ms. Gonzalez testified.
It was a habit, she said, that Mr. Menendez, 70, adopted after hearing tales of a visit by Cuban police officers who pressured their father to shut down a manufacturing facility he had operated in the back of their home.
"Daddy always said, 'Don't trust the banks. If you trust the banks, you never know what can happen,"' Ms. Gonzalez said.
When she was working as Mr. Menendez's legal secretary in the 1980s, Ms. Gonzalez said her brother once asked her to retrieve $ 500 in cash he kept stored in a box in his family's apartment in Union City, N.J.
Ms. Gonzalez was the first witness called Monday as the senator's lawyers began to present a defense against charges that Mr. Menendez accepted gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for political favors.
In a June 2022 search of the home where Mr. Menendez lives with his wife, Nadine Menendez, F.B.I. agents found 13 gold bars and more than $ 480,000 in cash, much of it stuffed in boots, coat pockets and a duffel bag or locked in a safe.
The second defense witness, Katia Tabourian, Ms. Menendez's younger sister, described the bedroom closet where F.B.I. agents discovered the gold bars. She said the door was kept locked, but said she had seen it open roughly 10 times and offered jurors details about the valuables inside, including family heirlooms.
Ms. Menendez kept the closet locked because years ago her children's nanny had stolen cash from the family, Ms. Tabourian said.
Their grandmother had given Ms. Menendez gold bars, she said, and jurors were shown a handwritten list of valuables signed by their father decades ago that included descriptions of gold and precious jewels.
"My sister got my grandmother's gold bars," Ms. Tabourian said. "My sister was my grandmother's favorite."
Mr. Menendez's lawyers, in an effort to shift blame to Ms. Menendez, have painted a picture of a couple who lived largely separate lives. They have emphasized that all of the gold discovered was found in Ms. Menendez's closet and claimed in an opening statement that the senator was unaware of "what she was asking others to give her."
On cross-examination, Ms. Tabourian was questioned about whether Mr. Menendez was asked to leave the couple's room when her sister opened the closet to get dressed -- an effort by a prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, to challenge the notion that he would have had no knowledge of its contents.
The gold bars found in the closet were stamped with serial numbers traced to gold owned by two New Jersey businessmen, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, who are accused of funneling bribes to the couple in exchange for political favors and are on trial with the senator. Ms. Menendez was also charged, but the judge, Sidney H. Stein, postponed her trial because she is being treated for breast cancer. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
The defense's presentation before the jury comes as the trial enters its eighth week in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Menendez is defending himself against charges that he and his wife conspired to take bribes in return for steering aid and weapons to Egypt and meddling in several criminal investigations in New Jersey on behalf of his allies.
The testimony from Ms. Gonzalez and Ms. Tabourian offered Mr. Menendez's lawyers the opportunity to present the jury with the kind of personal history that might otherwise have been available only through the senator's own testimony, were he to take the stand.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have not indicated whether he will testify in his own defense; one lawyer, Adam Fee, told the judge on Monday that it was "still under consideration."
On Monday afternoon, Russell Richardson, a forensic accountant who analyzed Mr. Menendez's cash banking withdrawals, testified that the senator took out roughly $ 400, about twice a month, between 2008 and 2022. During that time, those withdrawals totaled more than $ 150,000, Mr. Richardson said.
Much of the cash the F.B.I. seized was found bundled in $ 10,000 stacks.
Mr. Richardson, in cross-examination by a prosecutor, Catherine Ghosh, said there were no $ 10,000 withdrawals in the records he analyzed.
The senator's lawyers and prosecutors, in courtroom debates outside the jury's presence, have differed on just how much of the senator's family history may be described for the jury.
For example, Mr. Menendez's defense team wanted to call a psychiatrist to testify that the loss of the family's life savings when leaving Cuba and his father's death by suicide led to the senator's habit of stockpiling cash at home. The senator's father, a compulsive gambler, died after Mr. Menendez "eventually decided to discontinue paying off his father's gambling debts," his lawyers wrote in a filing.
The judge barred the psychiatrist from being called as a witness, but Ms. Gonzalez's testimony was able to offer jurors a window into their family's traditions. She was not asked about their father's death.
Ms. Tabourian's testimony also took jurors through a similar immigration story.
Ms. Tabourian, like her sister, was born in Beirut, Lebanon, but left during the civil war in 1975. She said their family, originally from Armenia, had been rug merchants who were wealthy enough to hire nannies for both Ms. Menendez and Ms. Tabourian.
After leaving Beirut, the family settled on Long Island after a brief time in London and California.
Part of Mr. Menendez's defense rests on showing that during the early months of the alleged bribery conspiracy, the senator and his future wife had broken up and were therefore unlikely to have been colluding.
"At the time they are supposed to be acting together to get the senator to betray his country, he is breaking up with her," Mr. Fee said last week.
Ms. Tabourian said her sister contacted her on Election Day in November 2018, upset that she and Mr. Menendez had broken up. Her sister asked her to help broker a resolution.
"My sister was in a previous relationship, an unhealthy relationship, and that was creating a lot of chaos in her relationship with the senator," Ms. Tabourian testified.
After Ms. Tabourian sent Mr. Menendez a text message, he responded in an email that was shown to jurors.
The senator wrote that he could not "get over her being" with her former boyfriend "while she was with me."
"Maybe time will heal wounds but not today," he wrote. "Wish it was different."
By early 2019, the couple had reunited. They were engaged later that year and married in October 2020.

Full text: After seven weeks of trial, lawyers for Senator Robert Menendez are expected to begin calling witnesses on Monday to rebut the government's case.
After seven weeks of trial, federal prosecutors rested their case on Friday against Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat accused of conspiring to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold, cash and other bribes in return for the senator's willingness to dispense political favors at home and abroad.
Defense lawyers are expected to begin calling witnesses next week in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Throughout the trial, lawyers for Mr. Menendez, who has vigorously maintained his innocence, have aggressively cross-examined a parade of government witnesses, seeking to undermine their credibility.
"The government hasn't proven its case," Mr. Menendez said as he left the courthouse on Friday.
The conclusion of the government's case comes nine months after Mr. Menendez, his wife and several New Jersey businessmen were first charged with participating in a vast bribery conspiracy that prosecutors say began in 2018.
The senator is accused of taking bribes in exchange for steering aid and weapons to Egypt, propping up an ally's business monopoly and trying to disrupt several criminal investigations in New Jersey on behalf of friends.
The original indictment was updated multiple times as prosecutors broadened the charges. In October, the senator was charged with being an agent of Egypt. In March, he and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were accused of obstructing justice by causing their attorneys to make false statements to prosecutors in an attempt to suggest that alleged bribes were legitimate loans. (The lawyers were not accused of wrongdoing.)
The trial, which began in May, is expected to wrap up after the July 4 holiday. Mr. Menendez, 70, has said he will be exonerated and that he hopes to run for re-election in November. On Thursday, paperwork was filed in Washington on Mr. Menendez's behalf formally notifying the Federal Election Commission that he planned to seek a fourth term in the Senate as an independent.
Since the start of the trial, prosecutors have introduced thousands of pieces of evidence, including text, email and voice mail messages, and questioned more than a dozen witnesses. New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, Philip R. Sellinger, and a former attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, were both called to testify against the senator in connection with claims that he had tried to pressure them into quashing criminal prosecutions.
The senator's longtime political adviser and a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who had worked with Mr. Menendez for years, each spent hours on the witness stand.
Two of the businessmen charged with Mr. Menendez, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, are on trial with him. Ms. Menendez, 57, had her trial postponed by the judge, Sidney H. Stein, because she is being treated for breast cancer. Like the senator, Ms. Menendez, Mr. Daibes and Mr. Hana have all pleaded not guilty.
Jose Uribe, a former insurance broker who pleaded guilty in March, spent several days on the witness stand outlining his role in the alleged conspiracy. Mr. Uribe admitted to providing Ms. Menendez with a Mercedes-Benz in 2019 in exchange for gaining the senator's "power and influence" to "stop and kill" insurance fraud investigations that prosecutors in Mr. Grewal's office were pursuing.
Mr. Uribe told jurors he had several one-on-one conversations with Mr. Menendez about the state fraud investigations. He also testified, however, that he and the senator had never discussed the car or how it would be paid for.
According to prosecutors, Ms. Menendez served as a vital go-between and a conduit for the bribes.
But Mr. Menendez's lawyers have argued that the senator was unaware of his wife's activities, and that he had no key to a locked bedroom closet in the couple's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where F.B.I. agents found much of the cash and all of the bars of gold bullion.
On Friday, an F.B.I. forensic accountant, Megan Rafferty, testified about what the senator's bank records showed about how and when money had moved in and out of his accounts. During cross-examination, the senator's lawyer, Adam Fee, elicited testimony indicating the senator made regular $ 400 withdrawals over the years, seemingly intended to bolster Mr. Menendez's public statements that he regularly withdrew cash in small amounts and stockpiled it at home for "emergencies."
Then, shortly before 1:30 p.m., after Ms. Rafferty left the witness stand, a prosecutor, Eli J. Mark, rose and said, "Your honor, at this time the government rests."

Menendez's Case Centers On Wife's Ex and Poverty: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez's lawyers are expected to call witnesses who will describe his childhood and the rocky start to his relationship with his wife.
Senator Robert Menendez's lawyers have cast him as a man who was duped by his dazzling wife, Nadine Menendez, and unaware of the gold bars and cash she kept in her locked bedroom closet -- or the deals she made to get them.
Now, as they prepare to rebut claims that the senator was at the center of a yearslong bribery conspiracy, they are expected to call witnesses who will describe the couple's tumultuous early relationship, Mr. Menendez's parents' history as Cuban refugees and the senator's habit of storing cash at home.
After seven weeks of trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors rested their case on Friday, paving the way for the defense to begin offering evidence intended to poke holes in the government's case. Mr. Menendez, 70, and Ms. Menendez, 57, are charged with taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for the senator's efforts to steer aid to Egypt, prop up an ally's business monopoly and disrupt criminal investigations on behalf of friends.
The senator, a Democrat, is on trial, however, without his wife. A judge postponed Ms. Menendez's trial after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Both have pleaded not guilty.
Ms. Menendez's sister and the senator's sister are expected to be the first two witnesses called to the stand in Mr. Menendez's defense, according to a government letter filed on Thursday and a courtroom exchange after jurors were excused for the day.
There was no mention of the senator's being called to testify in his own defense, although that could change.
Ms. Menendez's sister will testify about the on-again, off-again nature of the couple's early relationship in 2018 and an ex-boyfriend who nearly derailed their courtship for good, one of the senator's lawyers, Adam Fee, told the judge, Sidney H. Stein.
The senator had broken up with Ms. Menendez in the fall of 2018 as a result of an overlapping relationship she was having with her longtime boyfriend, Doug Anton, during "the heart of the conspiracy alleged" by the government, Mr. Fee told Judge Stein.
Mr. Fee seemed to suggest that he wanted to argue that the senator and Ms. Menendez could not have been in a conspiracy together since their relationship, at least for a time, had ended.
"At the time they are supposed to be acting together to get the senator to betray his country, he is breaking up with her," Mr. Fee said. "He is telling Nadine: 'I'm going to cancel the trip we had planned. I want the jewelry I gave you back."'
Ms. Menendez asked her sister to intervene to broker a resolution, Mr. Fee said. Her sister complied, he said, and sent the senator a message that explained Ms. Menendez was "leaving that guy, she really wants you back, please take her back."
The couple reconciled some time after Ms. Menendez was involved in a fatal car accident in Bogota, N.J., on Dec. 12, 2018. Ms. Menendez was not tested for drugs or alcohol after the crash, which killed a pedestrian, and she was not charged with wrongdoing.
Evidence introduced during the trial showed that Ms. Menendez called the senator from the accident scene and that they spoke for about three minutes. Weeks later, Mr. Menendez accompanied Ms. Menendez to a towing company's lot to retrieve items from her car, a company official told The New York Times. The couple got engaged in October 2019 and married a year later.
The jury was not told any details of the accident, only that it occurred and that Ms. Menendez was left without a car -- a need that prosecutors say led to one of the first bribes, a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Prosecutors objected to an apparent plan by Mr. Menendez's lawyers to introduce evidence tied to Ms. Menendez's troubled relationship with Mr. Anton, according to the government letter filed Thursday.
Mr. Anton, a lawyer who dated Ms. Menendez for nearly seven years, said any claim that he harmed Ms. Menendez in any way was "ridiculous."
"Everything she ever made up about me was fake," he said in an interview.
Judge Stein ultimately ruled that he would bar the introduction of evidence related to specific claims of mistreatment.
"This is not going to be 'Days of Our Lives' or some soap opera," he said on Thursday.
But the judge agreed that some elements of the senator's case tied to Mr. Anton could be presented to the jury. For example, a flip phone that Ms. Menendez called her "007" phone was given to her by a friend after she expressed concern that Mr. Anton had access to her iPhone, Mr. Fee said. Mr. Anton said he did not access her phone.
Prosecutors have shown jurors evidence that Mr. Menendez frequently used an iPhone app to track Ms. Menendez's location, countering defense claims that the couple lived largely separate lives. This was done, Mr. Fee said, out of a concern for her safety because of the former relationship.
Paul M. Monteleoni, a prosecutor, argued that the reason the senator regularly searched for Ms. Menendez's location was irrelevant.
"He still was watching her so closely that she didn't have the opportunity to deceive him in the way the defense is attempting to indicate," Mr. Monteleoni said.
The identity of the witnesses expected to testify on the senator's behalf and their proposed testimony were among elements of the senator's defense that were outlined in the government letter that was posted on the online docket Thursday afternoon and then quickly removed.
The Times viewed the letter while it was posted. The court's daily transcript shows that during a conversation out of the jury's presence, Mr. Fee asked Judge Stein to have the letter taken down, expressing concern that its public filing, with descriptions of defense witnesses and expected testimony, "will have a chilling effect on these witnesses and others." The judge agreed.
In the letter, prosecutors say Mr. Menendez's lawyers have told them the senator's sister will testify about "her knowledge of Senator Menendez's personal and family history of storing cash outside of banks and the reason for doing so," including her own observation of cash he stored in his home and office.
The origins of the cash the F.B.I. found in the couple's Englewood Cliffs, N.J., home during a court-authorized search in June 2022 has been a heated issue of dispute in the case.
Prosecutors have said the cash was of recent vintage, and part of bribes paid to the couple. But after being charged last September, Mr. Menendez offered what he described as an "old-fashioned" explanation for at least some of the cash. For three decades, he said, he withdrew money weekly from his savings account for "emergencies." He said he did so "because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba."
In an opening statement last month, Avi Weitzman, another of Mr. Menendez's lawyers, said that when the senator's family fled to the United States from Cuba in the early 1950s, they lost their entire life savings except for some cash that was stored away and hidden in a grandfather clock. "From a young age," Mr. Weitzman said, "the senator came to learn the value of having cash on hand in your home."
Judge Stein has already denied a request by Mr. Menendez's lawyers to have a psychiatrist testify about what they called the senator's "traumatic experiences in his past associated with cash and finances." The psychiatrist was to explain that Mr. Menendez's habit of stockpiling cash was rooted in deep psychological trauma tied to his father's suicide decades ago after Mr. Menendez decided to discontinue paying off his father's gambling debts.
In their letter to the judge on Thursday, prosecutors objected to the jury hearing what they called "gratuitous details of poverty or alleged emotional trauma." Judge Stein, later in the daysuggested he would allow testimony that was in line with Mr. Weitzman's opening statement: "They fled Cuba. He grew up in a tenement. They lost their life savings. That kind of thing," the judge said.
He ruled more formally on Friday, saying tales of squalor, like those depicted in Frank McCourt's memoir "Angela's Ashes," would not be permitted.

NEW YORK — After seven weeks of trial, federal prosecutors rested their case Friday against Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who is accused of conspiring to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold, cash and other bribes in return for his willingness to dispense political favors at home and abroad.
Defense lawyers are expected to begin calling witnesses next week in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Full text: On Thursday in Atlanta, the Argentine national soccer team will kick off the 2024 edition of Copa América, South America's biggest soccer championship, with a game against Canada. Fans around the world, but especially in Argentina, have been eagerly awaiting this day ever since their beloved squad, led by perhaps the greatest soccer player of all time, won the 2022 World Cup.
But when Lionel Messi, the Argentine captain and superstar, takes the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium with his teammates as the favorites to defend their 2021 Copa América title, a simmering sadness will follow him.
Will this be the last time that Messi, who turns 37 next week and said two years ago that it was his final World Cup, wears the blue and white Argentine uniform in a major tournament? Will this be the last time one of the most famous humans on Earth, who brought joy to many during unstable times in his homeland, represents his soccer-obsessed country?
"He's already saying goodbye, with the interviews he's been giving, it seems like he's preparing us for it," said Sergio Colque, 40, an electrician, as he waited to play in a recreational soccer match last weekend in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina.
Jonathan Icikson, 27, an ambulance dispatcher, was with friends outside a bar last week watching Argentina play against Guatemala in its final tuneup before Copa América. "The sadness, obviously, can't be measured in words," he said, "but not all endings are happy. All good things come to an end at some point."
This Copa América will certainly be the end for this group of Argentine players.
Ángel Di María, 36, a star in his own right and Messi's teammate of 16 years, has said he will retire from international duty after the three-week competition ends. Other veterans, such as 36-year-old Nicolás Otamendi, haven't specified how much longer they will go on, but age is catching up to this golden generation of Argentine soccer.
"There's a bit of fear that it's all ending," Messi said about his career in a recent television interview.
When Argentina defeated France in the World Cup final in Qatar, it was the country's first title since 1986. Another Argentine superstar, Diego Maradona, one of the greatest players of all time, led that team to victory.
But in his four previous attempts, and through the ups and downs of his relationship with his country, Messi had fallen short in living up to the expectations as Maradona's successor. It was the one achievement that had eluded Messi, who has claimed a record eight Ballons d'Or awards as the world's best player.
Yet when Messi finally did it, Argentina celebrated unlike ever before. Five million people -- roughly 10 percent of the country's population -- filled the streets of Buenos Aires for the national team's parade, one of the largest events in Argentina's history.
"We experienced the World Cup in a difficult moment," said Lorena Rovere, 45, a pharmacist in Buenos Aires. "Then we came back to reality."
Argentina's economy has been mired in a recession for years and continues to have one of the world's highest inflation rates, at roughly 276 percent annually.
Sworn into office in December vowing to fix Argentina's finances, President Javier Milei, a right-wing libertarian, warned that things would get worse before they got better as he instituted a drastic austerity program. He promised to take a "chain saw" to public spending, blaming it for the country's economic ills.
Unemployment has risen this year, poverty has soared and a growing number of Argentines are finding it difficult to make ends meet.
The senate approved a bill this month that Mr. Milei said would make Argentina more attractive to investors by, among other things, paving the way for privatizations and doing away with labor protections. The legislation led to protests and the detention of more than 30 people.
To many Argentines, watching Messi and Co. dart around a soccer field, perhaps for a nostalgic final run together, provides a much welcomed, if momentary, respite.
"It won't solve our country's deeper issues," said Gabriel del Rio, 45, a youth soccer coach and a city traffic light inspector in Buenos Aires. He said his 27-year-old son recently started the application process to obtain an Italian passport, and he believes that living abroad could be the answer for his 16-year-old daughter, too, because of the limited opportunities in Argentina.
But soccer "does provide a temporary joy to people," Mr. Del Rio said. "The players understand this; they knew it during the World Cup and now with Copa América. It's about giving people a brief distraction, something to enjoy amid ongoing challenges."
Manuel Peñalba, 21, a university student in Buenos Aires who works as a freelance video editor, said Argentina "deserved" the World Cup title given the country's problems.
He said he plans to watch all of Argentina's Copa América games with friends. They will have to rely on television broadcasts since all the matches in the tournament, run by the South American soccer confederation Conmebol, will be played in the United States, for the second time in the competition's 108-year history. That is part of an agreement with Concacaf, the confederation governing the sport in North and Central America and the Caribbean.
In addition to the United States and Canada, this year's Copa América invitees from outside of South America include Mexico, Panama, Jamaica and Costa Rica.
Beyond the obvious financial benefits of playing in the United States, Copa América is also a tuneup for the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Messi has more recently become noncommittal about playing in the next installment, when he will be 39, an age he has admitted makes it difficult to compete at that level.
In a recent interview with ESPN Argentina, Messi said he thinks his current club, Inter Miami, will be his final one. (Last year, he surprised many when he signed with Inter Miami of Major League Soccer, a relatively new league in North America, after two decades of playing in more talented leagues in Europe, with Barcelona and Paris-St. Germain.)
But winning the World Cup has breathed new life into Messi. After struggling to win for Argentina -- he briefly retired from the national team after losing the World Cup final to Germany in 2014, and the Copa América finals to Chile in 2015 and 2016 -- he has said he wants to be around now more than ever.
"I'm aware that there's not a lot of time left," he told ESPN recently.
Lionel Scaloni, the coach of the Argentine team, told Telemundo Deportes this month that "we Argentines are too melancholic."
"We are already thinking about the day when he's gone when he's still playing," he added. "Let's enjoy him and we'll see tomorrow."
Alejandro Wall, an Argentine sports journalist who has written seven soccer books, including one about Messi last year, said it was hard to imagine a national team without Messi.
But, he added, the team was already entering "a moment of transition," with Mr. Di María retiring, Messi logging fewer minutes and talented younger players emerging.
"To a large extent, Messi is going to test himself in this Copa América," Mr. Wall said, "and see how he comes out of it to see what's next."
Many fans said they hoped that Messi would hold on for a little bit longer, even if only as a lesser-used player, for the next World Cup. Saying goodbye is hard. He could still provide a few more smiles back home.
"The team knows how to play without Messi," Mr. Peñalba said. "It's the end of an era. It's painful, but it's coming."

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — On Thursday in Atlanta, the Argentine national soccer team kicked off the 2024 edition of Copa América, South America’s biggest soccer championship, with a 2-0 win over Canada.

Top Democratic Power Broker Is Charged With Racketeering: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Jersey's attorney general said George Norcross, who built a political empire from Camden, N.J., had been running a "criminal enterprise" for 12 years.
George E. Norcross III, an insurance executive who for decades has been one New Jersey's most powerful Democratic kingmakers, was charged on Monday with racketeering in what prosecutors say was a 12-year scheme that involved his brother, his lawyer and a former mayor of Camden, N.J.
The 13-count indictment unsealed by New Jersey's attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, accused Mr. Norcross and five co-defendants of unlawfully obtaining property and property rights along Camden's waterfront, fraudulently collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax breaks and influencing government officials.
"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden," Mr. Platkin said as he announced the charges, Mr. Norcross led a "criminal enterprise" that "took the Camden waterfront all for themselves."
The indictment accuses Mr. Norcross of bullying rival developers who were also trying to capitalize on a push to revitalize the waterfront in Camden, a poor city outside Philadelphia long plagued by violent crime.
"Are you threatening me?" one developer asked, according to a recorded telephone call mentioned in the indictment.
"Absolutely," Mr. Norcross replied.
Mr. Norcross's brother, Philip A. Norcross, the chief executive of a Camden-based law firm, and the city's former mayor, Dana L. Redd, were also charged with racketeering in the first degree, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
On Monday afternoon, George Norcross, 68, who now lives in Florida, showed up, uninvited, to a news conference Mr. Platkin held in Trenton, N.J. Dressed in a suit and loafers without socks, he stared from the front row of the room as the attorney general described the charges contained in a 111-page indictment. Mr. Norcross's team of lawyers and at least one co-defendant, William Tambussi, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Norcross and the city of Camden, sat behind him.
Soon after, in an impromptu news conference, Mr. Norcross accused Mr. Platkin of carrying out a personal vendetta, calling him a "coward" and a "politician masquerading as an attorney general."
"He's innocent," his lawyer, Michael Critchley, added. "He's not afraid of the accusations."
Kevin H. Marino, a lawyer for Philip Norcross, called the allegations "bogus" and said Mr. Platkin had been "blindsided by his own ambition."
The charges against George Norcross, a feared political survivor, immediately served to further tarnish the already blemished reputation of New Jersey politics. The state's senior senator, Robert Menendez, is in his sixth week of a corruption trial, charged by federal prosecutors with accepting cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for doling out favors for allies.
Mr. Norcross, who was a member of the Democratic National Committee until 2021, was for decades the most powerful unelected political official in New Jersey. He formed alliances that often blurred the lines between the Democratic and Republican parties. For years he was both a close friend of the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and a member of former President Donald J. Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.
By donating generously to political campaigns and assembling an ironclad voting bloc of South Jersey lawmakers, he was instrumental in selecting governors, steering bills through the Legislature and influencing state policy.
About a year ago, Mr. Norcross suggested he was stepping back from politics after a series of embarrassing legislative defeats. His public statements coincided with news reports that the attorney general's office had revived its investigation into more than a billion dollars in tax breaks awarded to South Jersey companies through legislation backed by former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and close ally of Mr. Norcross.
Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, had railed against that tax incentive program during his first term and sparred openly with Mr. Norcross -- tension that defined much of his first two years in office. Mr. Platkin was Mr. Murphy's chief counsel when the state began investigating the program, the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, and was later tapped as attorney general.
Crafted with help from a well-connected Democratic lawyer, the program gave out nearly $ 7 billion in tax breaks but provided few guardrails to protect the state against fraud.
Controversy over the corporate tax breaks prompted legislative hearings and subpoenas to companies and at least one state agency, but charges were never filed.
Mr. Platkin, Mr. Norcross said, carried his "agenda" with him to the attorney general's office, where he "forced people in his building to implement his will."
The friction between Mr. Norcross and the Murphy administration peaked in 2019, when Sue Altman, then the leader of the left-leaning Working Families Alliance and closely aligned with the governor, was forcibly removed from a standing-room-only hearing on corporate tax breaks after troopers indicated she had caused a disruption. She was led past Mr. Norcross, who was at the hearing to testify in support of the economic incentive program that Ms. Altman had criticized harshly.
Ms. Altman, a Democrat who is now running for Congress against Representative Tom Kean, called the indictment "monumental."
"Like Donald Trump," she said in a statement, "George Norcross and his South Jersey cronies are finding out that breaking the law for personal gain has consequences."
The feud between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Norcross began to ease as the governor was running for re-election in 2021. Mr. Murphy signed off on his own $ 14 billion tax incentive package in late 2020, and he and Mr. Norcross began appearing together in public, a scenario that for years was unheard-of.
Last year, as Mr. Murphy's wife, Tammy Murphy, was vying to run for U.S. Senate, the Camden County Democratic Committee, an influential group controlled by Mr. Norcross, was one of the first political organizations to back her. The endorsement came at a crucial time for Ms. Murphy, a first-time candidate, helping to bestow an air of inevitability to her campaign.
Ms. Murphy dropped out of the race in March, days before a crucial building block of Mr. Norcross's success -- a practice unique to New Jersey in which party leaders gave preferential treatment to their favored candidates on primary election ballots -- was declared unconstitutional, first by Mr. Platkin and then by a federal judge.
As a result, Mr. Platkin's relationship with Mr. Murphy, once one of his closest allies, has since frayed.
On Monday, in an odd twist to an already stunning series of events, Mr. Norcross heaped praise on Mr. Murphy, his former archenemy who in 2019 he called a politically incompetent "liar" who "thinks he's the king of England" in an interview with a reporter for nj.com.
He said the governor had been "incredibly supportive" and "generous" toward the city of Camden.
A spokesman for Mr. Murphy said the governor had no comment about the indictment.
In addition to Mr. Norcross and his brother, the others charged are:
Mr. Tambussi, 66, of Brigantine, N.J., the longtime personal lawyer for Mr. Norcross.
Ms. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, N.J., the chief executive officer of Camden Community Partnership, and the former mayor of Camden.
Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, the chief executive of NFI, a trucking and logistics company.
John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pa., who has been in the executive leadership of the Michaels Organization, a residential development company.
Mr. Tambussi, who was part of the large group that joined Mr. Norcross, Mr. Critchley and Mr. Marino at Mr. Platkin's news conference, said he was "proud of the work" he had done for the city of Camden.
"I kind of wonder why I'm here," he added.

Trump and Menendez Both Went on Trial, but That's Where the Similarities End: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It is unclear if Senator Robert Menendez's comportment will affect the verdict in his case, but Donald Trump's surly attitude certainly didn't seem to help.
One politician grumbled in the courtroom, sounded off to the reporters who gathered outside and seemingly nodded off in full view of the jury. The other has followed the courtroom action avidly, his head twisting as if watching a tennis match, and occasionally broken into song in the hallway.
Indeed, while both men face possible prison time and undetermined political damage, the contrast between the two powerful 70-something politicians recently on trial in Manhattan --Donald J. Trump and Robert Menendez -- extends far beyond their political affiliations. Each has adopted very different demeanors while sitting at the defense table.
Mr. Menendez, 70, the veteran Democratic senator from New Jersey facing federal corruption charges, has been an attentive participant, pivoting his gaze between the witnesses testifying against him and his defense team fighting back. He makes no faces and has held no impromptu news conferences. His social media has been mum on the trial.
Mr. Trump, 78, took a different tack. During his seven-week trial in state court, the former president and presumptive Republican nominee staged the legal equivalent of a sit-in, glumly protesting the proceedings. There were substantial stretches where he was either sleeping or, as he asserted, resting his "beautiful blue eyes."
He occasionally mumbled complaints under his breath -- earning a warning from the judge -- while spending much of his time outside the courtroom loudly berating Democrats, President Biden, the Manhattan district attorney and the very air around him. (He complained about the chilly temperature in the courtroom.) Some of his out-of-court comments and online postings caused the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, to fine Mr. Trump $ 10,000 for violating a gag order in the case.
Mr. Menendez is accused of trading favors for cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz convertible; his trial, which just wrapped up its fifth week, is expected to last until July.
And while we do not yet know how -- or whether -- Mr. Menendez's comportment will affect the verdict in his case, Mr. Trump's attitude certainly didn't seem to help: A jury found him guilty of 34 felonies on just its second day of deliberations, a clean sweep for prosecutors and a verdict that comes with up to four years in prison. (His sentencing is July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention, which he is expected to headline.)
Defense attorneys and jury experts say that almost every impression defendants make can sway a panel's opinion, from the way they sit to whether they take notes.
"The jury's going to look at everything you do," said Arthur Aidala, a prominent criminal defense lawyer. "If you're picking your nose, you're picking the wax out of your ears, they're going to be watching you, right? You're the person they're judging. And whether we like it or not, they're not going to just judge you on the evidence."
Renato Stabile, an attorney and managing director at Dubin Research and Consulting, says he advises clients that tacit evaluation begins "the moment the jury walks into the room" for jury selection.
"Everybody's watching the defendant like a hawk," he said, adding: "It's like being an actor onstage. When the curtain goes up, all eyes are on you."
And Mr. Stabile said that his primary concern was clients who appear not to be taking the charges -- and case against them -- seriously, including joking around with their attorneys, laughing or "showing any lightness."
"It could be a highly tense environment and situation and occasionally you need to break the tension," he said. "But jurors pick up on those things."
Those signals sometimes extend to the lawyers themselves, Mr. Aidala added, saying that he modifies his wardrobe and accouterment depending on where he's working, right down to the pens he uses. Fancier for some cases, more utilitarian when he needs to take fast notes.
Mr. Aidala mentioned a murder case in Suffolk County where he "dialed it down a little bit," in his choice of attire, versus a case in federal court he worked on defending Lawrence Taylor, a former Giants linebacker.
"I think juries there expect, you know, a certain heightened sense of style," Mr. Aidala said.
The contrast between the two courtrooms where Mr. Trump and Mr. Menendez have been tried, just a block or so apart, is stark. The federal courthouse where Mr. Menendez is on trial is a gleaming tower, guarded by U.S. Marshals and adorned with sketches of judges and famous cases. There's a staff fitness center, a spacious outdoor terrace and a cafeteria serving salmon, wraps, and salads.
The state court where Mr. Trump was convicted is a squatter, more squalid facility, ringed in scaffolding and abutting a demolition site. The interior is gloomy, the lighting little help. There's a cafeteria here, too, seemingly staffed by a single hard-working employee and offering underfilled bags of chips, plastic-wrapped bagels and a menu that ranges from grilled cheese ( $ 4.70) to grilled Swiss cheese ( $ 5.95).
While Mr. Trump's trial brought a crush of media and security, with barricades inside and outside the building, the scene surrounding Mr. Menendez's case is considerably more mellow.
If Mr. Trump used breaks in proceedings to make brash statements to reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom, the senator often stands quietly at the defense table as court prepares to start, either gazing back at the gallery or drumming his fingers on the desk in front of him. (He does have his quirks: In the early weeks of the trial, Mr. Menendez could be heard singing loudly to himself in a nearby hallway during breaks, though the exact song was uncertain.)
Mr. Menendez is being tried alongside two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes. After court is done for the day, he usually walks among the crowd of reporters and observers in the courtroom, including his daughter, the MSNBC host Alicia Menendez, who has sat in the front row on her days off from television duties, quietly observing and taking notes. Mr. Trump's sons, Eric and Donald Jr., also attended their father's trial, later blasting the case in media appearances.
Valerie Hans, a professor of law at Cornell University who has studied jury behavior, noted that the presence and actions of defendants' families and other supporters can influence juries too.
"They sometimes look to this 'offstage' behavior away from the witness box for clues about credibility," Ms. Hans said.
Ms. Hans recalled a personal injury case in which jurors told her that they were puzzled as to why the injured woman's husband was sitting so far away from his spouse. He was seeking damages for loss of companionship because of his wife's physical state, and the distance led jurors to wonder "what the quality of their relationship really was."
The testimony in both politicians' cases has sometimes been uncomfortable to listen to, including an account of Mr. Trump having sex with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, whose $ 130,000 hush-money payoff in 2016 lay at heart of the 34 counts of falsifying business records that he was convicted on. (Mr. Trump still denies having sex with Ms. Daniels.)
In Mr. Menendez's case, there have been less graphic, but still cringe-worthy details, including testimony about the senator ringing a small bell to summon his then-girlfriend, now-wife, Nadine, to an outdoor meeting.
But while Mr. Trump harrumphed at accounts of his alleged extramarital affairs, Mr. Menendez has remained placid despite testimony painting him as a corrupt public servant who bragged that he had "saved your ass" to a New Jersey businessman, Jose Uribe, who requested a covert favor.
Emotional outbursts are generally discouraged, Mr. Stabile said, though sometimes acceptable if authentic. "I think something that jurors and people are all very good at is picking up on manufactured emotions," he said.
During another recent high-profile trial -- that of President Biden's son Hunter -- the younger Mr. Biden appeared to fight back tears as his daughter, Naomi Biden Neal, described his battles with addiction. (Mr. Trump showed few emotions during his trial other than annoyance, though one prominent witness against him, Hope Hicks, a former top aide, was bought to tears during her testimony.)
Despite his seeming remorse for his behavior, Mr. Biden was convicted on three felony counts for lying on a federal firearms application.
To be sure, Ms. Hans said that most juries remain true to the idea that evidence is the most important element, rather than "tangential information they might glean" from the way a defendant comports themselves.
"When the prosecution case is strong," she said, "they are likely to convict."

As U.A.W. Scores Wins in Red States, Tensions Rise Over War in Gaza: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tentative new contract at an Ohio battery maker on Monday was big for President Biden's E.V. transition, but for some, the victory was upstaged by the U.A.W.'s activism on college campuses.
The United Automobile Workers has scored a remarkable string of victories -- most recently, a landmark contract on Monday for electric vehicle battery workers -- as its new leadership strives to restore the union's image as the voice of an iconic segment of the American working class.
But competing for headlines is a part of the union that represents tens of thousands of university workers, which at the moment is singularly focused on a mission far from building cars and trucks: ending Israel's war in Gaza.
U.A.W. leaders insist that they can smooth out the dissonance between the dual thrusts of U.A.W. activism -- one on college campuses, the other on red-state assembly lines. But it will not be easy. The U.A.W. signs that are crowding pro-Palestinian encampments on campuses, furnished by the union's international headquarters in Detroit, have alone struck sour notes among some union members uncomfortable with such outward signs of politics on such a fraught topic.
"It's so bad for the union," said Isaac Altman, a U.A.W. member and staff lawyer in the family court bureau of the Legal Aid Society of Nassau County, N.Y., who has clashed with his local over a pro-Palestine resolution he called "slightly more radical than Hezbollah." (The resolution called for an immediate cease-fire and an end to "the occupation and blockade of Palestinian land, sea and air by Israeli military forces.")
The competition for attention may only get worse. On Monday, union negotiators reached a tentative agreement with General Motors that could prove to be a landmark in the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles. It would give huge wage increases and far more safety protections to employees at an E.V. battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, solid evidence that President Biden's efforts to combat climate change could fulfill his promise that a green future will not leave workers behind.
"It's a huge deal," said Dave Green, the regional director of the U.A.W. in Ohio and Indiana. "We've been trying to have a just transition and stop this race to the bottom for wages for E.V. workers. This contract is very exciting."
At the same time that the contract emerged, the University of California was suing a U.A.W. local in the Golden State that represents 48,000 teaching assistants for striking over pro-Palestinian protests, a less-than-ideal image, union officials say, as the new U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, tries to organize politically conservative blue-collar workers.
University union members, now back to work, received strike pay -- $ 500 a week -- and other support from U.A.W. headquarters from the moment that University of California, Santa Cruz, graduate students walked off the job on May 20, no different from the autoworkers who manned the picket lines in Michigan, Missouri and Ohio last fall.
The union's blue-collar leadership was not exactly brought kicking and screaming to the Gaza protests. Its higher-education locals pressed the national leadership to get involved, but when, in December, the U.A.W. became the first major union to demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the board vote was unanimous.
Asked about the turmoil at California and New York union locals over Gaza, Mr. Green, who represents the U.A.W. in the Republican states of Ohio and Indiana, answered with a curt "no comment."
Without question, under Mr. Fain's muscular leadership, the U.A.W. has made strides toward reconnecting with the working class, a plus for President Biden, whom the union has endorsed. A six-week wave of strikes against the Big Three automakers last fall yielded the biggest pay raises for autoworkers in decades. An 11th-hour deal at the edge of a strike in April against Daimler Truck in North Carolina gave workers 25 percent raises.
Just days later, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted overwhelmingly to join the U.A.W., a breakthrough as the union pushes to organize foreign automakers -- especially electric vehicle plants -- in the union-hostile Southeast.
It has not all been smooth sailing: Last month, workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama voted against U.A.W. representation. On Monday, a court-appointed monitor watching the union for corruption accused Mr. Fain and the new leaders of obstructing attempts to access information in violation of a 2020 consent decree reached by the leaders whom Mr. Fain ousted to avoid a Justice Department takeover of the union.
The tentative contract reached this week at Ultium Cells, an E.V. battery joint venture in the shadow of a shuttered auto plant in Northeast Ohio that former President Donald J. Trump promised but failed to save, was meant to get the union back on a positive track. It includes 30 percent raises over three years for most workers, 112 percent raises for the lowest paid, $ 3,000 bonuses upon ratification and new positions for health and safety workers.
But just like Mr. Biden, Mr. Fain also has to placate pro-Palestinian activists, who are a legacy of past U.A.W. leadership that set out over the last decade to increase flagging membership by organizing teaching assistants and other employees of higher education, especially on the politically active West and Northeast coasts. For the U.A.W., the biggest success came in the last seven years, when tens of thousands of teaching assistants and other workers at the University of California, the University of Washington, the University of Connecticut, New York University and Harvard voted to join the auto union. More than one-quarter of the union's 391,000 members now work for universities.
"We have set out to rebuild this union and turn it into a fighting union, one that fights for union-organizing but also for humanity as a whole," said Brandon Mancilla, a U.A.W. board member who came to the union through organizing Harvard graduate students and has been instrumental in its stand on Gaza. "Of course, when you take on as ambitious and broad a mission as this, you're going to have issues that a lot of the mainstream don't see as central to traditional unions."
Not everyone sees it that way, inside the union and out. Last month, Republicans in Congress got involved when Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, subpoenaed the president of a small New York U.A.W. local that represents legal aid workers over its contentious vote for a cease-fire in Gaza and attendant accusations of antisemitism.
The local itself is badly split, with some calling the Republican probe a witch hunt and others suing their own union.
"It completely undermines us with management, it completely undermines us in the court of public opinion, and it distracts from the union doing what it's supposed to be doing: advocating for workers," Mr. Altman said. "It's preposterous."
U.A.W. leaders sought in interviews to tie together the union's blue-collar successes, its resurgent political activism on Gaza and the new clash with its federal monitor. An old-line labor union, they said, is ruffling a lot of feathers.
"We encourage the monitor to investigate whatever claims are brought to their office, because we know what they'll find: a U.A.W. leadership committed to serving the membership and running a democratic union," Mr. Fain said. Mr. Fain reasoned that taking a position on the issue was in line with the activism of the union's longtime president Walter Reuther against the Vietnam War and in support of civil rights, as well as with the U.A.W.'s stand against apartheid in South Africa.
"Everything we're doing is about us as workers having greater control over working conditions," said Rafael Jaime, the president of U.A.W. Local 4811 in California and a doctoral student in English at the University of California, Los Angeles. He cited pay, health care and safety, "but also a say in how we engage in protests on campus," adding, "We want to have a voice."
U.A.W. officials downplayed any disconnect. Some white, skilled tradesmen in the South may recoil at left-wing activism, officials said, but plenty of Southern workers, especially workers of color, agree with calls for an end to the war in Gaza, especially when it is tied to U.S. tax money, the officials added. Tim O'Hara, who was the vice president of the U.A.W. local in Lordstown, Ohio, when the G.M. plant shut down in 2018, preferred to talk up the new Ultium contract.
Lordstown's local has always been "iconic," he said. "They have now set the pattern for the contracts that will be negotiated for the Big 3 battery facilities" across the country.
Mr. Mancilla, the U.A.W. board member, noted that the union had also endorsed Mr. Biden's re-election, although many workers are not likely to vote for him. The activism on Gaza might not be a "day-to-day conversation" for organizers in Southern auto plants, he said. But he added, "I wouldn't say anyone is being quiet about anything. We're not hiding that we endorsed Joe Biden, even though many of our members might have different party affiliations."

As protests have consumed campuses, the union's new president, Shawn Fain, at left in glasses, has tried to organize conservative workers.

What to Know About the European E.V. Tariffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tariffs had been expected for months, but many European automakers warned that they would drive up prices for consumers and set off a trade war with China.
The European Union said on Wednesday that it would impose additional tariffs of up to 38 percent on electric cars built in China, a move it said would help level the playing field for automakers in Europe.
The tariffs, which have been expected for months, come on top of existing 10 percent duties, but the level of their impact has been disputed. Some European automakers argue they will set off a trade war, but other experts have said they will not stop China's dominance in the industry.
Instead, they argue that incentives to make low-emission cars more attractive to drivers are needed instead, if the European Union hopes to meet its goal to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles in 2035.
What does this mean for consumers?
Industry experts predict that the increased duties on electric vehicles from China will hurt consumers more than they do Chinese automakers, by increasing the price of the most affordable electric cars on the market.
But according to an investigation by the European Union, the entire supply chain of Chinese electric cars enjoys government subsidies that allow automakers there to drastically reduce their production costs. This gives Chinese producers an unfair competitive edge over their European rivals, the European investigation found.
BYD's Dolphin model, for example, sells in Europe for about 32,400 euros, or about $ 34,900, compared with nearly €40,000 for a Tesla Model Y and €37,000 for a Volkswagen ID.4.
Clamping down on E.V. exports to E.U. nations could drive more automakers in China to shift assembly to European countries like Hungary or Spain, where costs for labor and parts are higher, resulting in higher costs for consumers.
How will this affect European automakers?
Many European car manufacturers are heavily dependent on China, the world's largest market for automobiles, for both exports and production in the domestic market.
"This decision for additional import duties is the wrong way to go," Oliver Zipse, chief executive of BMW, said on Wednesday. "The E.U. Commission is thus harming European companies and European interests."
German manufacturers -- BMW as well as Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen -- not only sell to the Chinese but also have large production and research and development operations in China. They fear that any retribution from Beijing could harm their business.
Others remain interested in collaborations with the Chinese. Last month, Stellantis said it would start selling two models in Europe from its joint venture with the Chinese automaker Leapmotor as part of efforts to circumvent the tariffs.
Was the E.U. just following the United States?
The Biden administration announced last month that it would impose new tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric vehicles. That measure quadrupled the tariffs that the United States previously charged for foreign cars, in an effort to shield the American auto industry from Chinese competition.
Some analysts had worried that tariffs set at a lower level might not be enough to stop Chinese-made electric vehicles from going into the United States, given the big price difference between Chinese- and American-made cars.
But Wendy Cutler, the vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade official, said the 100 percent level would be high enough to block that trade. "That's what we call a prohibitive tariff. It really cuts trade off," she added.
The European Union began an investigation into Chinese E.V. subsidies in October, citing what leaders said was unfair competition, especially from China's three leading makers of electric cars, BYD, Geely and SAIC.
Is it a setback for climate policy?
Tariffs like these have set off a debate among some economists and climate activists about whether they're an obstacle in the fight against global warming. Gasoline-powered vehicles are a major producer of the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.
The argument against tariffs is that they make electric vehicles more expensive, slowing the transition away from fossil fuels. The Chinese government and several German automakers took up a similar line of argument, as did experts who pointed out that Western countries should be interested in cheaper electric vehicles if they wanted to meet their goals to combat climate change.
"Protectionist measures can only lead to higher car prices for the consumer and, in this case, also kick the can of achieving announced emission goals further into the long grass," said ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of supply chain management at Bayes Business School in London.
How did the E.U. get here?
The European Union is eager to avoid falling into a situation similar to one in the late 2000s, when Beijing pumped large sums of money into solar energy technology, enabling domestic manufacturers to make multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and gain market share globally.
China's boom in production caused the price of panels to plummet, forcing dozens of companies in Europe and the United States out of business. That led the European Commission to open an anti-dumping investigation that resulted in punitive tariffs on the Chinese panels.
But China retaliated, announcing its own investigation into exports of European wine and solar panel components, a move that divided members of the bloc. That allowed China to pit them against one another, ultimately leading the Europeans to back down.
More than a decade on, Germany's solar industry is still struggling, and cheap solar panels from China dominate the market.
What happens next?
Even before the announcement on tariffs from Brussels, demand for Chinese E.V.s in Europe had begun slowing down, as Germany and France cut back on subsidies for electric cars.
Last month, Great Wall Motors said it was closing its headquarters in Munich, citing "the increasingly challenging European electric vehicle market, coupled with numerous uncertainties in the future."
But BYD, China's leading manufacturer of electric cars and a sponsor of the 2024 European soccer championship that begins in Germany on Friday, remains focused on Europe. The company is already building a factory in Hungary and is considering a second one.

A Top Federal Prosecutor, and a Former Close Friend, Testifies Against Menendez: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Philip Sellinger, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, was a guest at Senator Robert Menendez's wedding in 2020.
Philip R. Sellinger, New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, testified on Wednesday that he had several conversations with Senator Robert Menendez about a bank fraud case Mr. Menendez is charged with trying to quash in exchange for bribes.
The case involved Fred Daibes, a real estate developer close to Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is on trial in Manhattan federal court, charged with being at the center of a yearslong bribery conspiracy.
The topic came up in December 2020, when Mr. Sellinger was being screened by Mr. Menendez for a prestigious job he had long sought and now holds: U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.
The senator told Mr. Sellinger that he believed "Mr. Daibes was being treated unfairly" by the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, and "hoped that if I became U.S. attorney that I would look at it carefully," Mr. Sellinger testified in the fifth week of Mr. Menendez's corruption trial.
The next day, Mr. Sellinger said he called the senator to explain that, if appointed U.S. attorney, he might be disqualified from involvement in Mr. Daibes's case because of an unrelated lawsuit his firm had handled that was "adverse" to Mr. Daibes.
That was the last time the two men spoke about it.
Their decades-long friendship ended soon after, Mr. Sellinger testified.
Mr. Sellinger explained that when he asked the senator to speak at a ceremony marking his appointment as U.S. attorney, Mr. Menendez refused.
"He said, 'I'm going to pass. The only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney -- and you don't,' " Mr. Sellinger testified.
Presidents, in selecting U.S. attorneys and federal judges, traditionally defer to their party's senior senator in a state -- in this case, Mr. Menendez.
The senator, 70, is accused in a federal indictment of trying to steer Mr. Sellinger into the U.S. attorney's job and pressuring him to go easy on Mr. Daibes, who prosecutors say rewarded Mr. Menendez handsomely with gold and cash.
It is one aspect of what prosecutors describe as a vast international conspiracy in which Mr. Menendez is accused of dispensing political favors in exchange for bribes. In earlier testimony, jurors heard from Jose Uribe, a disgraced New Jersey businessman, who said he gave Nadine Menendez, the senator's wife, a Mercedes-Benz in return for the senator's help to "stop and kill" an insurance fraud investigation.
The episode involving Mr. Sellinger is another instance in which, prosecutors say, Mr. Menendez meddled in a criminal investigation in New Jersey on behalf of a friend who was funneling him bribes.
But perhaps no allegation against the senator cuts to the heart of the criminal justice system as directly as the accusation that he tried to install and then influence a friendly U.S. attorney who would assume responsibility over Mr. Daibes's prosecution. Mr. Sellinger said that the December 2020 conversation was not the first time Mr. Menendez had advocated on behalf of Mr. Daibes before the New Jersey U.S. attorney's office. He testified that the senator told him he had complained to a previous U.S. attorney about Mr. Daibes's case and was left "unhappy with the discussion."
Mr. Sellinger told the jury that when Mr. Menendez raised the issue of Mr. Daibes's case, "I told the senator that any cases that came before me as United States attorney I would look at carefully." He said that was the end of the conversation.
During cross-examination by Avi Weitzman, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, Mr. Sellinger made clear that the senator had never requested that he take any improper action.
"I never believed him to be asking me to do anything unethical or improper," Mr. Sellinger testified.
Mr. Sellinger and Mr. Menendez have a long shared history in New Jersey.
The senator and Mr. Sellinger golfed, dined and sometimes traveled together. Mr. Sellinger donated generously to the senator's campaigns and held frequent fund-raisers for Mr. Menendez. In October 2020, when Mr. Menendez and Nadine Menendez married, Mr. Sellinger was among a group of just a few dozen wedding guests. (Mr. Daibes, Mr. Sellinger testified, was there, too.)
A month later, after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president, Mr. Sellinger was at the top of Mr. Menendez's shortlist to be recommended to the White House for nomination as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor.
But prosecutors have said that Mr. Menendez also tried to exact a commitment from Mr. Sellinger to act favorably in the case involving Mr. Daibes, who in 2018 was charged in a 14-count federal indictment in New Jersey with scheming to defraud a bank he had founded.
Mr. Daibes pleaded guilty in April 2022 to a single count of making false entries in connection with a $ 1.8 million loan document as part of an agreement that required no prison time. A judge rejected that plea agreement in October, scuttling the original deal altogether; the case is still pending.
In the bribery case, Mr. Menendez is being tried with Mr. Daibes and another businessman, Wael Hana. Prosecutors say both men were pivotal in funneling bribes to the senator and Ms. Menendez, 57.
Ms. Menendez's trial had been postponed until July because she is being treated for breast cancer; and late Wednesday, the judge, Sidney H. Stein, said he had delayed it again, until at least Aug. 5, while he awaits additional information from her doctors about her prognosis and her ability to assist in her defense.
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Uribe, who is cooperating with prosecutors, stepped down from the witness stand after testimony over four days, including aggressive cross-examination by Adam Fee, another of Mr. Menendez's lawyers.
Mr. Fee spent much of the morning dissecting Mr. Uribe's account of two one-on-one conversations he said he had with Mr. Menendez -- one on a patio outside Ms. Menendez's home and another during an August 2020 dinner at a New Jersey restaurant.
Mr. Fee challenged Mr. Uribe's memory about the size of a bell he said the senator used to summon his soon-to-be-wife to the patio and how much alcohol he had drunk before arriving at the house. ("A beer," Mr. Uribe testified.)
Mr. Fee also pressed him on a conversation he said he had with Mr. Menendez during the dinner, at which Ms. Menendez and her adult daughter were also present.
Mr. Uribe had testified on Monday that the two men spoke privately in Spanish after Ms. Menendez and her daughter stepped away to use the rest room, and Mr. Menendez spoke to him graphically. "He said, 'I saved your ass twice -- not once, but twice,"' Mr. Uribe told jurors on Monday.
"Was there a waiter nearby?" Mr. Fee challenged. "Were there any other diners, let's say, closer than an arm's length to Senator Menendez?"
No, he was told.
In the end, it was a prosecutor, Paul M. Monteleoni, who revealed more information about the conversation.
Mr. Monteleoni showed jurors a text message Mr. Menendez sent to Ms. Menendez at 9:23 p.m., around the time prosecutors said that they were eating.
"Can u go to bathroom" he asked.
Philip R. Sellinger, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, was once a close ally. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JEFFERSON SIEGEL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page A22.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jose Uribe was cross-examined for hours on Tuesday during his third day of testimony at Senator Robert Menendez's bribery trial.
For days, as the government's star witness was testifying against him, Senator Robert Menendez offered much the same comment each time he exited his bribery trial in Manhattan: "Wait for the cross and find the truth."
On Tuesday, that cross-examination began with a blistering volley of questions aimed at undermining the testimony of Jose Uribe, a disgraced insurance broker who pleaded guilty in March to conspiring to bribe Mr. Menendez with a Mercedes-Benz and is cooperating with federal prosecutors.
"You lied to customers?" Adam Fee, one of Mr. Menendez's lawyers, asked Mr. Uribe.
"You lied to a bank?" he added.
"You lied to the federal government?" he continued.
Mr. Uribe, 57, acknowledged that he had lied to all three, leading Mr. Fee to call him a "sophisticated liar" who was willing to put his family members in legal jeopardy to cover up his crimes.
Mr. Uribe, who also pleaded guilty in 2011 to insurance fraud charges in New Jersey, maintained his composure during hours of aggressive cross-examination, even as he avoided answering many questions by claiming he had "no recollection" of certain events.
On Monday, however, Mr. Uribe had offered detailed testimony about several face-to-face meetings he had with Mr. Menendez during his quest to enlist the senator's help to "stop and kill" an insurance fraud investigation that implicated Mr. Uribe and two of his close associates.
Mr. Uribe's firsthand account went to the heart of the government's case against Mr. Menendez, a Democrat charged with accepting bribes of cash, gold and the Mercedes-Benz in exchange for meddling in criminal investigations, steering aid to Egypt and propping up a friend's halal meat certification monopoly.
Mr. Uribe told jurors that he and Mr. Menendez discussed the insurance fraud case in a private, hourlong conversation on the eve of a Sept. 6, 2019, meeting the senator had scheduled with a former New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal.
Mr. Grewal testified last week that during his brief sit-down at the senator's office in Newark he flatly refused Mr. Menendez's overture to discuss a specific case.
Still, hours after that meeting ended, Mr. Menendez summoned Mr. Uribe to his apartment building to offer reassurance. "That thing that you asked me about -- it doesn't seem to be anything there," Mr. Uribe testified the senator told him.
Mr. Uribe has pleaded guilty to providing Nadine Menendez, the senator's wife, with the Mercedes and making the car's monthly payments for more than two years, in exchange for gaining Mr. Menendez's "power and influence."
Mr. Uribe testified that he believed the senator was aware he was paying for the car. But he has also repeatedly said that he never discussed the Mercedes -- or how it was being paid for -- with Mr. Menendez.
"I never talked to Mr. Menendez about making payments for the car," he testified.
Ms. Menendez and two New Jersey businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are also charged in the bribery conspiracy. The two businessmen are on trial with Mr. Menendez; Ms. Menendez's trial was postponed until next month to give her time to be treated for breast cancer. All four have pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Uribe testified that his first private conversation with the senator took place on an outdoor patio at Ms. Menendez's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
He and the senator poured drinks from a bottle of Grand Marnier brandy that Mr. Uribe had brought as a gift. The senator smoked a cigar, Mr. Uribe told jurors, and the two men discussed the fraud investigation he had sought Mr. Menendez's help in quashing.
Before Mr. Uribe left, the senator shook a small bell to summon Ms. Menendez from inside the house; she brought out a piece of paper, and Mr. Uribe said he was instructed to write down the names of the two businesses and the two associates who were targets of the attorney general's investigation.
The senator folded the paper and slipped it into his pocket, Mr. Uribe testified.
On Tuesday morning, a lawyer for Mr. Hana, Ricardo Solano Jr., worked to paint Mr. Uribe as a habitual liar, eliciting hours of vague replies and a frequent incantation -- "I don't have a recollection."
The judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, denied a request by Mr. Hana's lawyers to tell jurors about Mr. Uribe's missed child support payments, apparent visits to strip clubs and credit card debt -- evidence offered to undercut the family-man image he had projected in his earlier testimony.
In denying the request, Judge Stein alluded to Mr. Uribe's criminal history and told the lawyers, "You have just got so much material to work with."
When Mr. Uribe told Judge Stein in March that he had tried to bribe the senator with a luxury car, it was the second time he had pleaded guilty to participating in criminal activity.
In 2011, Mr. Uribe pleaded guilty to taking $ 76,000 in insurance premiums but failing to buy coverage for seven clients, all commercial drivers. He was sentenced in New Jersey to probation and stripped of his insurance broker's license.
Mr. Uribe acknowledged on cross-examination that he had installed his sister, his son and a 19-year-old woman who had come to him for help after becoming pregnant as principals in several companies he continued to run, illegally, after losing his license. He also told jurors that he had failed for years to pay business taxes, had lied about being married on his personal income tax forms and had fraudulently obtained two loans to purchase trucking equipment.
"This witness has been left in tatters, and I don't believe that testimony can establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt," Lawrence S. Lustberg, another of Mr. Hana's lawyers, said after court ended for the day.
Leaving court on Tuesday, Mr. Menendez said only that Mr. Uribe's testimony -- which is expected to continue on Wednesday -- "speaks for itself."

Full text: Jose Uribe faces cross-examination on Tuesday during his third day of testimony at Senator Robert Menendez's bribery trial.
Jose Uribe, a star government witness with a checkered past, is expected to testify on Tuesday for a third day at Senator Robert Menendez's bribery trial as the focus of the proceeding shifts toward a series of face-to-face meetings Mr. Uribe had with the senator.
Mr. Uribe, who has pleaded guilty to trying to bribe Mr. Menendez with a Mercedes-Benz, is likely to face hours of cross-examination by defense attorneys about at least one element that was missing from his direct testimony: any discussion with the senator of a payoff.
"I never talked to Mr. Menendez about making payments for the car," Mr. Uribe said in court on Monday.
Mr. Uribe's testimony did reveal two private meetings with the senator that were not mentioned in last year's indictment against Mr. Menendez, Nadine Menendez, the senator's wife, and two New Jersey businessmen also charged in the bribery conspiracy, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes. All four have pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Uribe's firsthand account goes to the heart of the government's case against Mr. Menendez, a once-powerful Democrat who is in his fifth week of trial, charged with accepting cash, gold and the Mercedes-Benz in exchange for meddling in criminal investigations, steering aid to Egypt and propping up Mr. Hana's halal meat monopoly.
Mr. Uribe, 57, told jurors that he was invited to Ms. Menendez's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where he spoke with the senator alone for roughly an hour on the eve of a Sept. 6, 2019, meeting Mr. Menendez held with a former New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal.
Mr. Uribe and the senator poured drinks from a bottle of Grand Marnier brandy that Mr. Uribe had brought as a gift. The senator smoked a cigar and they discussed an insurance fraud investigation that Mr. Uribe testified he wanted Mr. Menendez's help quashing.
Before Mr. Uribe left, the senator shook a small bell to summon Ms. Menendez from inside the house; she brought out a piece of paper, and Mr. Uribe said he was instructed to write down the names of the two businesses and the two associates who were targets of the attorney general's fraud investigation.
The senator folded the paper and slipped it into his pocket, Mr. Uribe testified.
At noon the next day, the senator met with Mr. Grewal, who told jurors last week that during the brief sit-down at the senator's office in Newark he flatly refused Mr. Menendez's overture to discuss a specific case.
Less than three hours later, however, Mr. Uribe said he was told by Ms. Menendez to go to the senator's apartment building in New Jersey. The two men spoke briefly in the lobby, and Mr. Menendez offered him reassurance.
"That thing that you asked me about -- it doesn't seem to be anything there," Mr. Uribe testified the senator told him.
Mr. Uribe, 57, is expected to be questioned aggressively on Tuesday about his decision to plead guilty in March -- for the second time in 13 years.
In 2011, Mr. Uribe, an insurance broker, admitted taking taken $ 76,000 in insurance premiums but failing to buy coverage for seven clients, all commercial drivers. He was sentenced in New Jersey to probation and stripped of his insurance broker's license.
He testified Monday that he continued to run an insurance broker's office, in violation of his 2011 guilty plea. He also told jurors that he had failed for years to pay business taxes, had lied about being married on his personal income tax forms, and fraudulently obtained two loans to purchase trucking equipment.
In an opening statement last month, one of the senator's attorneys, Avi Weitzman, said of Mr. Uribe: "We'll have a lot to discuss at the end of the case about him -- about his lies and his cheating and his crimes and all the ways he's been incentivized to continue doing all of them."

Billionaire Faces Sexual Assault Charges: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A police force outside Toronto said that charges against Frank Stronach, 91, relate to episodes from as long ago as the 1980s and as recent as last year.
Frank Stronach, the 91-year-old billionaire founder of one of the world's largest auto parts companies, was arrested and charged on Friday in connection with a sexual assault investigation.
In a brief news release, the police force for Peel Region, outside Toronto, said that the time frame of crimes Mr. Stronach was alleged to have committed spanned from the 1980s until last year.
Mr. Stronach, the Austrian-born founder of Magna International, was charged with offenses that included indecent assault, sexual assault and forcible confinement. He was released after being charged and will appear later at a court in Brampton, Ontario.
Brian Greenspan, Mr. Stronach's lawyer, said that his client "categorically denies the allegations of impropriety which have been brought against him."
He added: "He looks forward to the opportunity to fully respond to the charges and to maintain his legacy, both as a philanthropist and as an icon of the Canadian business community."
Mr. Stronach turned a one-man machine shop he founded in 1957 into a global enterprise. Under his management, Magna, which also assembles vehicles for several automakers including Mercedes-Benz, tried to take over both Chrysler and Opel, the European arm of General Motors.
Investors in Magna often chafed at how Mr. Stronach used his control over the company through a special class of share to involve it in various, sometimes unprofitable, ventures unrelated to making car parts, including a failed restaurant chain, a glossy business magazine, golf courses and horse racing. In 2010, Magna gave Mr. Stronach about $ 1 billion to cede control.
The Stronach Group, which he founded and which is now run by his daughter, Belinda Stronach, owns or manages horse racing tracks throughout the United States.
In 2013, Team Stronach, a pro-business protest party founded by Mr. Stronach, won two seats in Austrian state parliaments.
In a statement, Tracy Fuerst, a Magna spokeswoman, said that it "has no knowledge of the investigation or the allegations that have been raised beyond what has been reported in the media."
The Stronach Group did not respond to a request for comment.
It is unclear why the charges were filed in Peel, which is part of the greater Toronto metropolitan area. Mr. Stronach lives in York, which is also in the Toronto area and where Magna has its headquarters. Constable Tyler Bell, a spokesman for the police, declined to comment on the investigation.
While he led Magna, which made him at one point Canada's highest-paid executive, Mr. Stronach often offered iconoclastic economic and political theories or comments that some found inappropriate. He began the company's 2007 annual meeting not by discussing his bid for Chrysler, but by asking shareholders who was more attractive to women, himself or his longtime aide, Manfred Gingl.
Mr. Stronach is the second Canadian billionaire to be charged with sex offenses in just over a week. The police in Montreal brought 21 sex-related charges against Robert G. Miller, the founder of Future Electronics, including several counts of sexual exploitation of minors. The police force said that he had paid several young girls to perform sexual acts.

Businessman Testifies He Bribed Menendez With a Mercedes-Benz: [National Desk]

Full text: Jose Uribe said he had provided the car to Senator Robert Menendez's future wife in exchange for gaining the senator's "power and influence."
Until recently, Jose Uribe was an obscure New Jersey businessman who had been caught up in what prosecutors say was a sprawling and lucrative bribery scheme involving Senator Robert Menendez and others.
But after Mr. Uribe pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the authorities, he vaulted into a more prominent position: star government witness.
On Friday, minutes after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Mr. Uribe said he had bribed Mr. Menendez. He said he had given the senator's wife, Nadine Menendez, a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for gaining "the power and influence" of the senator.
"When you bribed Robert Menendez, did you do that alone or with other people?" Lara Pomerantz, a prosecutor, asked.
"With other people," he responded.
Mr. Uribe, 57, said he had complained to Wael Hana, a longtime friend, about insurance fraud investigations in New Jersey that implicated Mr. Uribe's businesses and family members.
Mr. Hana, who founded a company that prosecutors say was being used to funnel bribes to the senator and his wife, told him that -- for a price -- he had "a way to make these things go away."
"He could go to Nadine, and Nadine would go to Senator Menendez," Mr. Uribe testified.
Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and his wife are charged with conspiring to take cash, gold bullion and other bribes collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for the senator's willingness to direct aid to Egypt and to meddle in criminal cases in New Jersey. One of those cases involved Mr. Uribe.
Mr. Uribe, a former insurance broker, testified that his goal was to enlist the senator's help to "stop and kill" the insurance fraud investigation, which was being conducted by New Jersey's attorney general. In return, Mr. Uribe said he agreed to buy Ms. Menendez, then the senator's girlfriend, a new Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible worth more than $ 60,000.
Mr. Uribe told jurors that he was motivated by a deep concern for his son and a young woman who worked for him and was like a member of his family. Both, he said, had been approached by a detective who was investigating the fraud cases.
In nearly three hours of testimony, he began to explain the genesis of the bribery plot.
Mr. Uribe said he arranged a meeting at a New Jersey hotel with Mr. Hana and two men who had received subpoenas in connection with the insurance fraud investigation. Mr. Hana told them that in exchange for $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 he could get a "resolution" that would "make these investigations stop and go away," Mr. Uribe testified.
He said he expected Ms. Menendez to serve as a go-between. He also testified that he did not discuss the bribery scheme with Mr. Menendez during three face-to-face encounters he said he had with the senator. Mr. Uribe's testimony is to continue on Monday.
While leaving the courthouse, Mr. Menendez, who has strenuously maintained his innocence, suggested his lawyers' cross-examination of Mr. Uribe would be revealing in its own way.
"Stay tuned, stay tuned," Mr. Menendez said, adding, "Wait for the cross and find the truth."
Mr. Uribe's testimony about the alleged deal focused primarily on his dealings with Mr. Hana and Nadine Menendez.
He testified that in July 2018, at Mr. Hana's suggestion, he organized a fund-raiser for Mr. Menendez, who was running for re-election. He said Mr. Hana told him it "would put us in better standing" with the senator.
Mr. Uribe agreed. "I wanted to be in the good graces of the senator," he told the jury, "because it was my best avenue at this point" to stop the investigations.
The event raised $ 50,000 -- Mr. Uribe donated $ 5,000 -- and he said he spoke briefly with Mr. Menendez and his wife.
He was with the senator again that night at an after-party, but Mr. Uribe said he did not broach the subject of the alleged deal with Mr. Menendez at either event.
Asked by Ms. Pomerantz how he felt about the status of the agreement then, Mr. Uribe said he believed the deal was underway and that the result would be good.
Mr. Hana's lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, said outside after the proceedings ended for the day that Mr. Uribe's "testimony so far -- and as it will evolve -- shows that there was no conspiratorial agreement."
Mr. Menendez, 70, is being tried with Mr. Hana and another businessman, Fred Daibes. Ms. Menendez, 57, was also charged, but the judge, Sidney H. Stein, postponed her trial until July because she is being treated for breast cancer. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
One of Mr. Menendez's lawyers, Avi Weitzman, declined to comment after the court day ended, but in an opening statement last month, he said the senator's defense team intended to show Mr. Uribe to be an untrustworthy witness.
"We'll have a lot to discuss at the end of the case about him, about his lies and his cheating and his crimes and all the ways he's been incentivized to continue doing all of them," Mr. Weitzman said.
Mr. Uribe took the stand a day after the jury heard testimony from Gurbir S. Grewal. Mr. Grewal was New Jersey's attorney general in 2019 when, prosecutors say, Mr. Menendez contacted him in hopes of having the investigations into Mr. Uribe's associates quashed.
Mr. Grewal, who now leads the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, testified on Thursday about being summoned to Mr. Menendez's Newark office. Mr. Grewal said that when he asked if the senator had concerns related to a specific matter pending before his office, Mr. Menendez said yes. Mr. Grewal said he immediately cut the conversation short.
"I didn't know the case. I didn't want to know the case," he testified, adding, "It's not something I was comfortable speaking to him about."
Earlier this week, prosecutors presented jurors with a chart summarizing 1,100 pieces of evidence, including scores of text messages, emails and voice mail messages. Messages Mr. Uribe sent to Ms. Menendez and Mr. Hana showed that the insurance fraud case appeared to be consuming Mr. Uribe.
"I need peace," Mr. Uribe wrote in a text message to Ms. Menendez. The next morning, Mr. Menendez placed a call to Mr. Grewal to arrange the meeting, according to prosecutors.
Mr. Uribe seemed to have advance knowledge of the meeting. "Thank you for everything you do for me. I am praying," he wrote in a text message to Ms. Menendez a few minutes before the senator's scheduled appointment with Mr. Grewal. "Today's meeting is in GOD's hand."
One of the people involved in the fraud investigation pleaded guilty in April in an agreement that required no prison time, according to the indictment. It was around that time that Mr. Uribe provided Ms. Menendez with the car.
It was clear from text messages that Mr. Uribe sent in fall 2019 that at least some aspect of the fraud inquiry continued to vex him. In late October, Mr. Uribe asked Ms. Menendez if she had an "update" for him.
"I just need peace," he wrote in a text message. "Sorry to bother you."
On Oct. 29, the senator called Mr. Uribe from his Senate office, prosecutors have said.
The conversation lasted less than three minutes. Mr. Uribe sent a text message to Ms. Menendez after hanging up, telling her that he was "a very happy person."
"I just got a call," he wrote in a text to Ms. Menendez, adding, "GOD bless you and him for ever."

NEW YORK — Until recently, Jose Uribe was an obscure New Jersey businessperson who had been caught up in what prosecutors say was a sprawling and lucrative bribery scheme involving Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and others.
But after Uribe pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with authorities, he vaulted into a more prominent position: star government witness.
On Friday, minutes after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Uribe said he had bribed Menendez. He said he had given the senator’s wife, Nadine Menendez, a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for gaining “the power and influence” of the senator.
“When you bribed Robert Menendez, did you do that alone or with other people?” asked Lara Pomerantz, a prosecutor.
“With other people,” he responded.
Uribe, 57, said he had complained to Wael Hana, a longtime friend, about insurance fraud investigations in New Jersey that implicated Uribe’s businesses and family members.
Hana, who founded a company that prosecutors say was being used to funnel bribes to the senator and his wife, told him that — for a price — he had “a way to make these things go away.”
“He could go to Nadine, and Nadine would go to Sen. Menendez,” Uribe testified.
Menendez and his wife are charged with conspiring to take cash, gold bullion and other bribes collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for the senator’s willingness to direct aid to Egypt and to meddle in criminal cases in New Jersey. One of those cases involved Uribe.
Uribe, a former insurance broker, testified that his goal was to enlist the senator’s help to “stop and kill” the insurance fraud investigation, which was being conducted by New Jersey’s attorney general. In return, Uribe said he agreed to buy Nadine Menendez, then the senator’s girlfriend, a new Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible worth more than $60,000.
Uribe told jurors that he was motivated by a deep concern for his son and a young woman who worked for him and was like a member of his family. Both, he said, had been approached by a detective who was investigating the fraud cases.
In nearly three hours of testimony, he began to explain the genesis of the bribery plot.
Uribe said he arranged a meeting at a New Jersey hotel with Hana and two men who had received subpoenas in connection with the insurance fraud investigation. Hana told them that in exchange for “$200,000 to $250,000” he could get a “resolution” that would “make these investigations stop and go away,” Uribe testified.
He said he expected Nadine Menendez to serve as a go-between. He also testified that he did not discuss the bribery scheme with Bob Menendez during three face-to-face encounters he said he had with the senator. Uribe’s testimony is to continue Monday.
While leaving the courthouse, the senator, who has strenuously maintained his innocence, suggested his lawyers’ cross-examination of Uribe would be revealing in its own way.
“Stay tuned. Stay tuned,” Menendez said, adding, “Wait for the cross and find the truth.”
Uribe’s testimony about the alleged deal focused primarily on his dealings with Hana and Nadine Menendez.
He testified that in July 2018, at Hana’s suggestion, he organized a fundraiser for Bob Menendez, who was running for reelection. Uribe said Hana told him it “would put us in a better standing” with the senator.
Uribe agreed. “I wanted to be in the good graces of the senator,” he told the jury, “because it was my best avenue at this point” to stop the investigations.
The event raised $50,000 — Uribe donated $5,000 — and he said he spoke briefly with Menendez and his wife.
He was with the senator again that night at an after-party, but Uribe said he did not broach the subject of the alleged deal with Menendez at either event.
Asked by Pomerantz how he felt about the status of the agreement then, Uribe said he believed the deal was underway and that the result would be good.
Hana’s lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, said outside after the proceedings ended for the day that Uribe’s “testimony so far — and as it will evolve — shows that there was no conspiratorial agreement.”
Menendez, 70, is being tried with Hana and another businessperson, Fred Daibes. Nadine Menendez, 57, was also charged, but the judge, Sidney H. Stein, postponed her trial until July because she is being treated for breast cancer. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
One of Menendez’s lawyers, Avi Weitzman, declined to comment after the court day ended, but in an opening statement last month, he said the senator’s defense team intended to show Uribe to be an untrustworthy witness.
“We’ll have a lot to discuss at the end of the case about him, about his lies and his cheating and his crimes and all the ways he’s been incentivized to continue doing all of them,” Weitzman said.
Uribe took the stand a day after the jury heard testimony from Gurbir S. Grewal. Grewal was New Jersey’s attorney general in 2019 when, prosecutors say, Menendez contacted him in hopes of having the investigations into Uribe’s associates quashed.
Grewal, who now leads the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division, testified Thursday about being summoned to Menendez’s office in Newark, New Jersey. Grewal said that when he asked if the senator had concerns related to a specific matter pending before his office, Menendez said yes. Grewal said he immediately cut the conversation short.
“I didn’t know the case. I didn’t want to know the case,” he testified, adding, “It’s not something I was comfortable speaking to him about.”
Earlier this week, prosecutors presented jurors with a chart summarizing 1,100 pieces of evidence, including scores of text messages, emails and voicemail messages. Messages that Uribe sent to Nadine Menendez and Hana showed that the insurance-fraud case appeared to be consuming Uribe.
“I need peace,” Uribe wrote in a text message to Nadine Menendez. The next morning, the senator placed a call to Grewal to arrange the meeting, according to prosecutors.
Uribe seemed to have advance knowledge of the meeting. “Thank you for everything you do for me. I am praying,” he wrote in a text message to Nadine Menendez a few minutes before the senator’s scheduled appointment with Grewal. “Today’s meeting is in GOD’s hand.”
One of the people involved in the fraud investigation pleaded guilty in April in an agreement that required no prison time, according to the indictment. It was around that time that Uribe provided Nadine Menendez with the car.
It was clear from text messages that Uribe sent in the fall of 2019 that at least some aspect of the fraud inquiry continued to vex him. In late October, Uribe asked Nadine Menendez if she had an “update” for him.
“I just need peace,” he wrote in a text message. “Sorry to bother you.”
On Oct. 29, the senator called Uribe from his Senate office, prosecutors have said.
The conversation lasted less than three minutes. Uribe sent a text message to Nadine Menendez after hanging up, telling her that he was “a very happy person.”
“I just got a call,” he wrote in a text to her, adding, “GOD bless you and him for ever.”

Full text: Prosecutors say Senator Robert Menendez contacted Gurbir S. Grewal in an effort to quash an insurance fraud investigation on behalf of an ally.
The September 2019 meeting was brief -- and awkward.
Senator Robert Menendez had summoned New Jersey's attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, to his office in Newark. Mr. Grewal, testifying Thursday at the senator's federal bribery trial in Manhattan, explained that he arrived with one of his top deputies, Andrew Bruck.
After an exchange of pleasantries, the senator expressed displeasure with the way Hispanic defendants tied to the trucking industry were being treated by prosecutors in Mr. Grewal's insurance fraud unit.
Mr. Grewal said he asked if the senator's concerns related to a specific matter pending before his office. When he was told yes, he immediately cut the conversation short.
"I didn't know the case. I didn't want to know the case," Mr. Grewal said, adding, "It's not something I was comfortable speaking to him about."
After leaving the building, Mr. Grewal and Mr. Bruck paused before climbing into a waiting car.
"Andrew said to me, 'Whoa, that was gross,"' Mr. Grewal testified.
Mr. Grewal was the second witness in Mr. Menendez's corruption trial to describe the tenor and details of a direct conversation with Mr. Menendez -- exchanges that go to the heart of prosecutors' claims that the senator used his political clout to help people who rewarded him and his wife, Nadine Menendez, with bribes.
Prosecutors have said that Mr. Menendez contacted Mr. Grewal on behalf of an ally, Jose Uribe, who had sought help from the senator in an effort to quash an insurance fraud case involving two of Mr. Uribe's associates. Mr. Uribe, who was charged last year in the alleged bribery conspiracy, pleaded guilty in March and is now cooperating with prosecutors.
Mr. Uribe admitted in court during his guilty plea that he had provided a Mercedes-Benz convertible to Ms. Menendez in an effort to influence the senator; Mr. Uribe is expected to testify on Friday.
Mr. Grewal told jurors that Mr. Menendez was polite and made no specific request, even though his displeasure was clear.
"What I understood the upshot of this conversation to be was that he didn't like how this matter was being handled by our office and wanted it handled differently," said Mr. Grewal, who never mentioned the conversation to prosecutors in the insurance fraud unit.
"I don't want my teams to feel pressured or intimidated in any way," he said. "I want them to make the calls in their cases based on the facts of their cases before them."
Being called as a witness in a criminal trial was an unusual role for Mr. Grewal, a former federal prosecutor who now leads the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division. Mr. Menendez turned to look directly at Mr. Grewal as he walked slowly to the stand to offer nearly three hours of testimony.
The New Jersey insurance fraud investigation involved a business associate of Mr. Uribe's and a woman he considered family. It appeared to be consuming Mr. Uribe, according to dozens of text messages he sent to Ms. Menendez and a businessman charged in the conspiracy, Wael Hana.
Mr. Grewal's cousin, Balpreet Grewal-Virk, was friendly with the senator and his wife and sometimes traveled with the couple; she was with them in India in October 2019 when the senator proposed to Ms. Menendez outside the Taj Mahal.
Mr. Grewal explained that his cousin had asked him if she could share his cellphone number with Mr. Menendez.
And in January 2019, months before their meeting in Newark, Mr. Menendez contacted Mr. Grewal on his cellphone. The conversation lasted roughly seven minutes, and the gist of the conversation, Mr. Grewal said, was similar to their face-to-face discussion.
In April, Mr. Uribe arranged for the Mercedes, to the delight of Ms. Menendez.
"Congratulations mon amour de la vie," Ms. Menendez wrote in a text to the senator, "we are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes."
But it was clear from text messages Mr. Uribe continued to send Ms. Menendez that at least some component of the legal problem was unresolved.
"I need peace," Mr. Uribe wrote in a text message to Ms. Menendez on Sept. 3, 2019, at 10:17 p.m. The next morning, Mr. Menendez placed a second call to Mr. Grewal to arrange the meeting at his Senate office in Newark, according to prosecutors.
Mr. Uribe seemed to be aware of the meeting, according to a text message he sent Ms. Menendez that morning. "Thank you for everything you do for me. I am praying," he wrote, "today's meeting is in GOD's hand."
Mr. Grewal's appearance came in the fourth week of the trial of Mr. Menendez, Mr. Hana and another businessman, Fred Daibes, in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Ms. Menendez also was charged in the case, but the judge, Sidney H. Stein, postponed her trial until July because she is being treated for breast cancer. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
The senator's lawyers have sought to distance their client from Ms. Menendez, suggesting that she kept her dire financial situation -- as well as her requests to friends for money -- a secret from her husband. Prosecutors have sought to undermine that strategy and this week introduced a chart summarizing emails, texts and voice mail recordings that presented the senator and his wife as close collaborators who spoke regularly and were intimately involved in mundane details of each other's daily lives.
In New Jersey, attorneys general are nominated by the governor and confirmed by lawmakers in the State Senate.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers, in pretrial court filings, noted that the senator, as a federal official, had no jurisdiction over state prosecutors as they argued that contact he had with Mr. Grewal could not be considered an official act.
Under cross-examination by Avi Weitzman, one of the senator's lawyers, Mr. Grewal said Mr. Menendez had not threatened him with retaliation in their conversations. "He didn't ask you to put your thumb on the scale of justice with respect to any particular matter either, right?" Mr. Weitzman said.
He had not, Mr. Grewal replied. "He did not pressure me," Mr. Grewal added.
In the end, the insurance fraud case was resolved with a plea agreement that did not require prison time, according to a federal indictment.
And in October 2019, Mr. Menendez called Mr. Uribe from his Senate office, prosecutors said.
"I just got a call and I am a very happy person," Mr. Uribe wrote to Ms. Menendez. "GOD bless you and him for ever."
Five days later, Mr. Uribe and the couple met for dinner and snapped photos of a champagne toast. Mr. Uribe followed up with Ms. Menendez the next afternoon.
"Can you send me the last invoice for the car pay and your full social," he wrote in a text. "I like to set it now in autopay rather than buying money orders."
"I have so much peace," he wrote two minutes later. "Gracias a DIOS and to you guys."

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez is accused of bribery and corruption. His lawyers have attempted to shift the blame to his wife, Nadine.
In January 2019, Senator Robert Menendez placed a seven-minute call to New Jersey's attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, in what prosecutors say was an effort to quash an insurance fraud case.
A New Jersey businessman, Jose Uribe, had been desperate to make the fraud charges disappear, prosecutors say. He had turned to Nadine Menendez -- who married the senator the next year -- for help.
In the hours and days before the senator's call, there was a flurry of communication between Ms. Menendez, Mr. Uribe and a second businessman who is charged with the senator and his wife in an elaborate bribery scheme. Ms. Menendez would often contact the senator soon after texting with the men, sometimes using an alternate phone that the couple referred to as her "007" phone.
The messages were shared Wednesday with jurors over hours of testimony from an F.B.I. special agent during the fourth week of Mr. Menendez's bribery trial. The agent was responsible for verifying the accuracy of a chart summarizing more than 1,100 pieces of evidence, including emails, texts and voice mail recordings.
Taken together, the messages appeared to be part of the prosecution's effort to undercut a central element of Mr. Menendez's defense: that he and his wife lived largely separate lives, and that he was unaware of her interactions with the men now accused of bribing the couple in exchange for political favors from the senator.
Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York took pains on Wednesday to instead present the senator and his wife as close collaborators who spoke regularly and were intimately involved in mundane details of each other's daily lives.
Jurors saw one photo Ms. Menendez sent of her feet to the senator after a pedicure and heard about how he often used an iPhone feature called Find My Friends to track her location.
The daylong recitation of messages also laid the groundwork for the next witness, Mr. Grewal, who left the New Jersey attorney general's office in 2021 and is expected to testify on Thursday about Mr. Menendez's outreach.
But the text exchanges shown on Wednesday focused largely on twin problems facing Mr. Uribe and Ms. Menendez.
Close associates of Mr. Uribe were under investigation for insurance fraud in New Jersey, including a woman he considered family. And Ms. Menendez's car had been damaged beyond repair in a December 2018 crash, leaving her scrambling for transportation.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Menendez's willingness to use his influence in exchange for payoffs offered a solution to both their problems -- and an opportunity for one of the first bribes in a yearslong conspiracy: a new Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Mr. Uribe, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors, has admitted that he arranged for a new Mercedes-Benz for Ms. Menendez in exchange for the senator's help.
Some of the messages sent to Ms. Menendez included screenshots showing the name of the judge and the defense lawyer handling the insurance fraud case Mr. Uribe was concerned about. Others described the criminal charges that he wanted dismissed. "The deal is to kill and stop all investigation," Mr. Uribe wrote to Wael Hana, his friend and business associate who is charged in the conspiracy and is on trial with Mr. Menendez, 70.
The Mercedes replaced a vehicle Ms. Menendez was driving when she struck and killed Richard Koop, 49, in Bogota, N.J., in 2018. Ms. Menendez was not tested for drugs or alcohol afterward and was not charged with wrongdoing.
Jurors will not be told that the crash involved a fatality.
But they were given a glimpse into the senator's involvement after the crash.
The evidence introduced on Wednesday showed that the senator called Ms. Menendez about 20 minutes later, while she was still at the scene, and that they spoke for more than two minutes. The next day, he texted her: "Hope your ok. I was worried about you. You had a traumatic experience."
From the trial's first day, lawyers for the senator made clear that their strategy would be to shift blame to Ms. Menendez, 57. (The judge, Sidney H. Stein, postponed Ms. Menendez's trial until the summer because she is being treated for breast cancer.) The couple, Mr. Hana and another co-defendant, Fred Daibes, have pleaded not guilty.
The senator's lawyers have portrayed him as living largely independently from Ms. Menendez. One of the lawyers, Avi Weitzman, has told the jury that Ms. Menendez hid her financial difficulties from the senator, keeping him "in the dark on what she was asking others to give her."
In a courtroom discussion late Tuesday after jurors were sent home for the day, the parties debated whether certain communications between the Menendezes could be shown to the jury. Prosecutors, for example, wanted to introduce text messages from April 5, 2019, apparently exchanged while Ms. Menendez was picking up the Mercedes.
Mr. Menendez texted her: "Congrats!!! On your cleaning up your emails!!" She soon texted back: "Under 5900 emails now. I'm still here," indicating she was still at the dealership signing papers.
A prosecutor, Paul M. Monteleoni, told Judge Stein that the texts showed Mr. Menendez "is checking on what she's doing electronically" and that he had "direct, close involvement in what she's doing on the day that she is getting the car."
Judge Stein sided with the government on the issue. "The separateness of their lives is a pretty important part of the defense here," he said during the discussion, adding that the messages showed "how they were in constant contact on rather quotidian issues."

E.V. Batteries Can Fuel The Grid (and Win Drivers): [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers are exploring energy storage as a way to help utilities and save customers money, turning an expensive component into an industry asset.
Electric cars are more expensive than gasoline models largely because batteries cost so much. But new technology could turn those pricey devices into an asset, giving owners benefits like reduced utility bills, lower lease payments or free parking.
Ford Motor, General Motors, BMW and other automakers are exploring how electric-car batteries could be used to store excess renewable energy to help utilities deal with fluctuations in supply and demand for power. Automakers would make money by serving as intermediaries between car owners and power suppliers.
Millions of cars could be thought of as a huge energy system that, for the first time, will be connected to another enormous energy system, the electrical grid, said Matthias Preindl, an associate professor of power electronic systems at Columbia University.
"We're just at the starting point," Dr. Preindl said. "They will interact more in the future, and they can potentially support one another -- or stress one another."
A large flat screen on the wall of the Munich offices of the Mobility House, a firm whose investors include Mercedes-Benz and Renault, illustrates one way that carmakers could profit while helping to stabilize the grid.
The graphs and numbers on the screen provide a real-time picture of a European energy market where investors and utilities buy and sell electricity. The price changes from minute to minute as supply and demand surge or ebb.
The Mobility House buys power when solar and wind power is abundant and cheap, storing it in electric vehicles that are part of its system and plugged in around Europe. When demand and prices climb, the company resells the electricity. It's a classic play: Buy low, sell high.
People in the automobile and energy industries have been talking for years about using car batteries for grid storage. As the number of electric cars on the road increases, those ideas are becoming more tangible.
Renault, the French carmaker, is offering Mobility House technology to buyers of its R5 electric compact car, for which the company began taking orders last month. The car, which Renault will begin delivering in December, starts at 29,490 euros (about $ 32,000) in France.
Buyers who opt in will get a free home charger and sign a contract allowing Renault to draw power from the vehicles when they are plugged in. R5 owners will be able to control how much power they give back to the grid and when. In return, they'll get a break on their electricity bills.
"The more they plug in, the more they earn," said Ziad Dagher, a Renault executive in charge of the program. Renault estimates that participants could cut 50 percent from their home energy bills.
Renault, which will offer the technology in France before rolling it out in Germany, Britain and other countries, will share in the profits that the Mobility House generates from energy trading.
If such services prove successful, the financial argument for electric vehicles, an important tool against climate change, will become stronger.
"It would really drive E.V. adoption," said Adam Langton, a BMW executive who works on energy issues.
BMW already offers software that allows owners to charge their electric cars when renewable energy is most abundant. That allows the company to earn carbon credits and pay customers who take part in the program.
A new generation of electric vehicles that BMW will begin selling next year, known as the Neue Klasse, will have so-called bidirectional capability, meaning the cars will be able to take electricity from the grid and release it back in addition to using the energy to power their motors.
Ford was a pioneer in two-way charging with the F-150 Lightning pickup, which can power a home during a blackout. General Motors, Hyundai and Volkswagen also offer or plan to offer cars with bidirectional charging. As such vehicles become more common, the storage potential could be enormous.
By the end of the decade, an estimated 30 million electric vehicles could be on U.S. roads, up from about three million now. All those cars could store as much power as a day's output from dozens of nuclear plants.
But of course those millions of cars may also put a strain on the grid, which is already getting increasing electricity demand from heat pumps and data centers, said Aseem Kapur, chief revenue officer at GM Energy, a unit of General Motors that provides services to electric vehicle owners. By helping to smooth out demand, "E.V.s can be a significant resource," he said.
But a few problems need to be worked out before that vision can be realized.
Owners may not be eager to have their cars serve the grid because they are worried that constant charging and discharging will wear down their batteries faster.
Some energy experts said the degradation would be insignificant, especially if utilities drew on only a small fraction of a battery's capacity. Renault is dealing with that issue by offering participants in its energy storage program the same eight-year, 160,000-kilometer warranty that people who don't take part receive.
Another challenge is that some U.S. utilities and the state regulators that oversee them prefer running centralized grids in which energy flows almost entirely in one direction -- from power plants to homes and businesses.
To overcome resistance from utilities, Maryland last month adopted a law that requires them to accommodate bidirectional charging schemes and provide financial incentives.
There is growing recognition that electric vehicle batteries are valuable investments that most owners will actively use for only a few hours a day.
"We want to unlock the full value of electric vehicle batteries," said Gregor Hintler, chief executive of the Mobility House for North America.
If all the electric cars in New York City were used as storage, said Dr. Preindl, the Columbia professor, "those vehicles would be the most valuable power plant in New York by far."
Consolidated Edison, the utility that serves New York City and some of its suburbs, is exploring how managing charging times and using electric vehicles for storage could help it cope with the fast growth of battery-powered cars.
Contrary to popular fears, "the grid is not going to collapse" because of electric cars, said Britt Reichborn-Kjennerud, the director of e-mobility at Con Ed. "The bigger concern is that if we don't plan differently for this very fast-increasing load, the grid won't be ready in time to support the transition."
Con Ed supplies the power to a Bronx depot for New York City electric school buses, where Mobility House software allows more vehicles to use the facility.
Fleets of electric vehicles owned by businesses or governments are a particularly promising form of backup energy storage. Vans or trucks have large batteries and tend to have predictable routes and schedules.
Ford Pro, the commercial-vehicle division of Ford Motor, has begun offering free chargers to customers who allow them to be switched off during peaks in electricity demand. Owners also save on their electricity bills.
Ford provides the software to manage the chargers and accommodate customers' driving needs, and it manages the relationship with utilities. Ford is testing the service in Massachusetts before expanding it to other states. The next step will be a two-way system that allows the vehicles to send energy to the grid.
"What smart charging can do is cut costs," said Jim Gawron, director of charging strategy at Ford's electric vehicle division. "That has been a key barrier for customers."

F.B.I. Eyed Menendez At a Steakhouse Dinner: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At Senator Robert Menendez's bribery trial, an investigator described surveilling diners at a Washington restaurant. Among them were Mr. Menendez and an Egyptian official.
The man and the woman arrived at the Washington steakhouse one evening in May 2019 and took a table on the patio, near where five diners already were seated and seemed to be enjoying themselves. Jackets were off, laughter was heard and wine was being poured. A cigarette dangled from one man's hand.
But there was something else that stood out: Among the five were Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and his future wife, Nadine Menendez.
The couple who had arrived late appeared to be on a date. She was wearing a black dress, and during their meal he moved around their table and used a camera to, it appeared, snap her picture.
But in reality, court testimony on Tuesday showed, he was photographing the people behind her, seated at the senator's table. The couple were members of an F.B.I. surveillance team, and they had deliberately sat near Mr. Menendez and his group, which also included an Egyptian government official.
The undercover F.B.I. investigators also used concealed cameras to photograph and video-record the people at the table. The female investigator, Terrie Williams-Thompson, testified that at one point, she overheard Ms. Menendez, referring to the senator, ask the group, "What else can the love of my life do for you?"
The extraordinary scene of a U.S. senator under F.B.I. surveillance in an upscale restaurant, Morton's The Steakhouse, not far from the Capitol was detailed by Ms. Williams-Thompson in testimony at Mr. Menendez's federal corruption trial in Manhattan.
Ms. Williams-Thompson said she and a partner conducted surveillance for roughly two hours at the restaurant. The overheard comment by Ms. Menendez has featured prominently in the prosecution's case.
The Menendezes and two New Jersey businessmen -- Wael Hana and Fred Daibes -- have been charged in a conspiracy to give the senator and his wife gold, cash, a Mercedes-Benz and other bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for the senator's agreeing to steer aid and weapons to Egypt and to meddle in criminal cases in New Jersey.
An indictment filed last year says the dinner at the steakhouse was one of a number of meetings Ms. Menendez arranged for her husband and Egyptian officials.
The trial of Mr. Menendez, Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes in its fourth week; Ms. Menendez's trial was postponed by the judge, Sidney H. Stein, until July because she is being treated for breast cancer. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Menendez, who filed on Monday to run for re-election to the Senate as an independent, told reporters in Spanish as he left the courthouse Tuesday evening: "Every day we're showing the truth. Every day we're showing them our innocence."
Prosecutors also presented testimony Tuesday from Anna Frenzilli, an F.B.I. special agent who had executed a court-authorized search of a safe deposit box belonging to Ms. Menendez at a New Jersey bank.
Inside the box, she testified, agents found 10 envelopes -- some with "Nadine" written on them -- containing nearly $ 80,000 in cash and expired passports for her and her two children.
During a cross-examination of Agent Frenzilli, one of Mr. Menendez's lawyers, Avi Weitzman, seized on her testimony in an apparent attempt to distance the senator from his wife's financial dealings, a central aspect of Mr. Menendez's defense strategy. During the trial, his lawyers have cast Ms. Menendez as short on cash and eager to collect luxury items, like the Mercedes, and have said that Mr. Menendez knew nothing of her financial troubles and requests to friends for money.
Mr. Weitzman noted that the bank's log book showed that only Ms. Menendez had ever opened the box. He asked Agent Frenzilli if she had ever seen the senator's name on any of the envelopes or found any passports belonging to Mr. Menendez in the box.
No, the agent replied.
One of those envelopes, on which someone had scrawled " $ 10,000," contained DNA that matched a sample taken from Mr. Daibes, one of the senator's co-defendants, according to testimony Tuesday from Charity Davis, a forensic DNA examiner at the F.B.I. Mr. Daibes is accused of paying the Menendezes bribes in exchange for the senator's efforts to help him in a bank fraud case.
But it was the testimony about the F.B.I. surveillance of Mr. Menendez and others at his restaurant table that appeared to most rivet members of the six-man, six-woman jury.
During cross-examination, Ms. Williams-Thompson, in response to questions from another of the senator's lawyers, Adam Fee, said she had not seen anything to suggest Mr. Menendez and his fellow diners were aware of the F.B.I. surveillance or were trying to avoid being watched.
Ms. Williams-Thompson, a veteran of nearly two decades with the bureau, testified that when she conducted surveillance, her job was to blend into her surroundings. She typically wore Capri pants or jeans, tennis shoes and a shirt -- "We have to dress the part," she said. If she was following someone on a college campus, she would look like a student: "T-shirt, jeans, backpack, laptop, the whole nine yards," she said.
She also studied the life patterns of individuals she was assigned to follow: where they work; what time they leave home and return; how fast or slow they drive -- "just little everyday things about that individual," she said.
She said on the night of May 21, 2019, she and another investigator, Damein Ragland, were assigned to surveil "a subject from New York" who had come into the Washington area, whose name she did not know. She said the subject was not the senator but rather someone who happened to eat dinner with him at Morton's.
She suggested that the F.B.I. had more than one investigative team inside and outside Morton's that night; she was on a team composed of seven to eight people, she said.
She and Mr. Ragland posed as a married couple on a dinner date, and were driven to the restaurant by her team leader, who posed as an Uber driver.
They had been given a description of the subject and they viewed a photograph as well.
Ms. Williams-Thompson told the jury that she and Mr. Ragland used code names and kept their identities secret, even from Morton's personnel.
"We don't want to blow our cover," she explained. "We need to make sure that if there is going to be an act done, we do not need them to know the F.B.I. is there because then it won't be committed."
They acted like ordinary customers to maintain their cover with the Morton's staff as well as with the people at the next table. "We dined just like them," Ms. Williams-Thompson said.
When a prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, asked whether they had eaten, Ms. Williams-Thompson replied: "I sure did. It was good, too."
"That is part of blending in," she added. "You eat? I'm going to eat."
Judge Stein interjected: "I hope the F.B.I. paid for your meal."
"Oh yes, sir, they did."

U.S. Official Says Menendez Told Him to 'Stop Interfering': [National Desk]

Full text: Jurors in Senator Robert Menendez's bribery trial heard directly from a witness who recounted Mr. Menendez's efforts to flex his political muscle.
In May 2019, a top official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture got a call on his cellphone from Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
The conversation was brief, the senator was curt, and the message was clear: "Stop interfering with my constituent."
Ted A. McKinney, then the under secretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, testified about the exchange on Friday during the third week of Mr. Menendez's bribery trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
It was the first time that jurors had heard directly from a witness who attributed conduct to the senator that is central to the government's claim in an indictment that alleges a sprawling bribery conspiracy: that Mr. Menendez was willing to flex his political muscle to win favorable treatment for allies.
In exchange, prosecutors say, Mr. Menendez and his wife were rewarded with bribes including gold, wads of cash and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.
At the time of the call, Mr. McKinney and others at the U.S.D.A. had been publicly sounding the alarm about a deal Egypt had brokered that granted a halal meat monopoly to a New Jersey startup run by Wael Hana, a longtime friend of the senator's wife, Nadine Menendez.
Until then, four companies had divided the work of certifying that halal meat exported from the United States to Egypt had been prepared according to Islamic law. The sudden change was causing the price of halal products to climb in Egypt and risked the loss of business for U.S. ranchers, farmers and beef processors, Mr. McKinney said.
As he testified, Mr. McKinney was unambivalent about what he saw as the purpose of the call by Mr. Menendez, then the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
"I felt he was telling me to stand down," Mr. McKinney said, "and stop doing all of the things that we were doing."
According to the indictment, the company that won the monopoly, IS EG Halal, was used to funnel bribes to Mr. Menendez and his wife.
Mr. Hana, a U.S. citizen who emigrated from Egypt as a young adult, maintained close ties to Egyptian intelligence officials, according to trial testimony. As the halal meat monopoly was being negotiated, prosecutors say, Mr. Hana and Ms. Menendez arranged meetings between the senator and top Egyptian military officials; they also relayed messages about the country's desire for increased U.S. aid.
The United States had no power to block Egypt's decision to give the work to IS EG Halal. And on cross-examination, Mr. Menendez's lawyer, Adam Fee, stressed that fact.
He pressed Mr. McKinney about whether he was aware that Egypt had concerns that meat shipped from the United States was not being prepared according to Islamic custom before it shifted to a sole certifier, suggesting an alternative explanation for the lucrative monopoly.
Mr. McKinney said his main concern was that giving all the work to IS EG Halal, which had no prior experience in the industry, could cause delays in certification while increasing costs for farmers and U.S. beef processors. This, in turn, might limit U.S. companies' ability to market their products overseas.
"I wanted to make sure that we had competition," Mr. McKinney said.
Mr. Fee was to resume his cross-examination of Mr. McKinney on Monday. Mr. Menendez, in a brief comment to reporters outside the courthouse, said, "You wait for the cross and you'll find the truth."
Mr. Hana and a second New Jersey businessman, Fred Daibes, are charged with the senator and his wife in the bribery conspiracy. Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes are on trial with Mr. Menendez, but the judge, Sidney H. Stein, delayed Ms. Menendez's trial because she is being treated for breast cancer. All four have pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have challenged the government's version of what transpired in the conversation. "There was no pressure applied on the call," Avi Weitzman, another of the lawyers, told the jury in his opening statement.
Mr. Menendez had previously "reached out to federal agencies on multiple occasions in order to help constituents," Mr. Weitzman added. "That's his job."
In describing the call from the senator, Mr. McKinney testified that Mr. Menendez had begun by mentioning an article, published in Arabic, that had laid out the history of Egypt's newly streamlined certification process. Mr. McKinney said that when he had attempted to explain his concerns to the senator, he was abruptly cut off.
"He said, 'Let's not bother with that,' or 'That's not important,' or 'Let's not go there,"' Mr. McKinney said, acknowledging that he did not have an exact memory of the conversation from five years ago. "But he stopped my explanation."
Soon after the call, Mr. Menendez's Senate office forwarded the article and an English translation, and Mr. McKinney said he had begun preparing a written response.
He then acknowledged that he had become aware that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into the business arrangement, and he told his staff members not to send the prepared material.
"I put the word out," he testified, "to please stand down."
"It was in the hands of the F.B.I.," he added.

Prosecutors had called their first witness, and Senator Robert Menendez's blame-my-wife strategy in his federal bribery trial already appeared vulnerable.
An F.B.I. agent was testifying about a search of the New Jersey home that Mr. Menendez, 70, shares with his wife and the gold bars that were found inside a locked bedroom closet -- bribes prosecutors say were paid to the couple in exchange for political favors by the senator.
Although the closet held women's clothing, the agent said, a man's blue blazer was also found hanging inside, seemingly tying Mr. Menendez to the gold and other alleged bribes. The agent stuck by his account even after Mr. Menendez's lawyer, during cross-examination, pressed him and displayed a photograph showing the blazer hanging outside the closet.
But the next morning, the agent asked to clarify his testimony. After reviewing photographs of the search, he said, he agreed the blazer was hanging outside the closet.
Was his previous day's testimony no longer accurate? Mr. Menendez's lawyer asked.
"That is correct," the agent said.
The moment passed quickly, but the exchange illustrated what has become a central pillar of Mr. Menendez's defense: shifting blame to his 57-year-old spouse, Nadine Menendez, as he stands trial accused of trading political favors for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold.
The strategy, unusual and even startling when Mr. Menendez's lawyers first said they would use it, is not without precedent in American courtrooms. But the approach carries significant risk, legal experts said, not least because it has the potential to offend jurors.
Paul Shechtman, a longtime New York defense lawyer who lectures at Yale Law School, said that unless there is evidence in a case pointing strongly toward a defendant's spouse, a jury is unlikely to be sympathetic to an attempt to shift blame.
"One worries that the jury will say you've committed two crimes -- you've taken bribes and you've blamed your spouse," Mr. Shechtman said.
Prosecutors have portrayed Robert and Nadine Menendez as partners in a complicated web of corruption. Together, they are accused of conspiring to accept gold, cash, a Mercedes-Benz and other bribes collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for the senator's helping three New Jersey businessmen and the governments of Egypt and Qatar.
Ms. Menendez appears conspicuously in the indictment, both in the way it describes her relationships with the businessmen and the benefits it says she received. She had known one of the businessmen for years before her marriage to the senator. Two of them helped to pay off her mortgage debt and bought her the Mercedes, the indictment says. One of them promised to place her on the payroll of his company in a low- or no-show job.
The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York has not directly addressed the senator's courtroom strategy of trying to persuade jurors that his wife was to blame, but a prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, told the jury in an opening statement that Mr. Menendez "was careful when he was committing crimes."
"He was smart enough not to send too many texts," Ms. Pomerantz said. "Instead, he had Nadine do that for him. And sometimes, as you will see, he told her not to put things in writing.
"He used Nadine as his go-between to deliver messages to and from the people paying the bribes," she added.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have sought to portray the senator as living largely separately from his wife. They had separate bank accounts, credit cards and cellphone plans.
Mr. Menendez's lawyer, Avi Weitzman, told the jury in his opening statement that before their marriage, Nadine Menendez hid her money problems from her new boyfriend, keeping him "in the dark on what she was asking others to give her."
"She tried to get cash and assets any which way she could," Mr. Weitzman said.
Mr. Weitzman, foreshadowing the cross-examination of the F.B.I. agent, also told the jury that Senator Menendez did not have a key to his wife's locked bedroom closet, nor did he know she kept gold bars there.
"It is Nadine's closet," Mr. Weitzman said. "In fact, when you look inside the closet, you will see that it is filled with all of Nadine's clothing. Women's clothing."
Martin S. Bell, a former Southern District corruption prosecutor who is now in private practice, said the emerging narrative in the Menendez trial shows why the blame-my-wife defense may have been attractive to his lawyers.
"When a door opens that leads to any other explanation -- the behavior of a spouse, a closet space belonging to a partner -- you start to see daylight like a running back," Mr. Bell said. "It's hard not to run in that direction."
Mr. Menendez's lawyers, in a pretrial court filing, said they might have to argue, in effect, that any unlawful conduct that may have occurred -- "and we are aware of none -- involved the actions of others (including Nadine), not the senator."
Lawyers for Mr. Menendez and his wife each declined to comment Wednesday on the senator's defense strategy.
In pointing the finger at Ms. Menendez, the senator's lawyers are echoing a strategy used a decade ago by lawyers for Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia who was tried with his wife, Maureen, on charges they accepted more than $ 170,000 in loans and gifts from a nutritional supplements executive in return for political favors.
In a closing argument, the governor's lawyer, Hank Asbill, portrayed the couple's marriage as "too dysfunctional" for them to have conspired criminally, and he pinned blame on Ms. McDonnell for becoming infatuated with the executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr.
"Logical or not, Maureen misled Bob, or didn't tell Bob things relating to Jonnie Williams and money," Mr. Asbill said.
The prosecutor told the jury that Mr. McDonnell was "willing to throw his wife under the bus, and she's willing to let him, in order to avoid criminal convictions."
The McDonnells were both found guilty, but in a landmark 2016 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned the verdict and narrowed the definition of conduct that constituted official corruption.
Carrie H. Cohen, a former corruption prosecutor and once chief of the public integrity unit of the New York attorney general's office, said Mr. Menendez's defense appears right out of the McDonnell playbook. Both men, Ms. Cohen noted, had a wife who "liked finer things and finer cars," and each man claimed his wife acted without his knowledge.
"We've seen how this plays out," Ms. Cohen said. "It is a good defense to blame the spouse."
Ms. Menendez relied mainly on alimony and child support after her 2005 divorce, court records show. By 2018, when she and Mr. Menendez began dating, she was unemployed and behind on her home mortgage payments. Then, police records show she was involved in a fatal pedestrian crash, leaving her without a car. A businessman who was charged with the couple and pleaded guilty in March has admitted providing Ms. Menendez with a Mercedes to replace her wrecked car -- and to influence the senator.
Unlike the McDonnells, Mr. Menendez and his wife are being tried separately. The judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, postponed Ms. Menendez's trial until at least July to give her time to undergo a mastectomy and potential radiation treatment after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University School of Law, noted that Ms. Menendez, in a later trial, could adopt a similar strategy and point a finger of responsibility back at her husband.
"The fact of the two trials enables each to entirely blame the other -- perhaps successfully," Professor Gillers said.
He added that the spouse who is being blamed cannot be forced to address the allegation because of the privilege against self-incrimination as well as a legal doctrine that protects the marital relationship.
In the Menendez case, the success or failure of the senator's strategy could depend on whether his lawyers can persuade the jury of six men and six women that the once-influential Democrat and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was fooled by his girlfriend-turned-wife.
At the same time, jurors must find that a woman called the shots in such a scheme -- a scenario female jurors often accept more readily than some men, according to several defense lawyers.
Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, said she was not so sure that the gender of the Menendez jurors will have much to do with whether his blame-my-wife defense succeeds.
"The stereotype of a woman who's married to a powerful man and addicted to the trappings of that life and willing to do anything, stop at nothing, in order to get those benefits, that seems like it could go either way," Professor Roiphe said.
"My guess is it wouldn't work," she added. "But all you need is one juror who finds this compelling in order to hang the jury, so maybe they're hoping for that."

Why Unions Now Struggle To Expand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Teamsters union has made little headway in organizing workers at Amazon and FedEx despite wage and other gains it secured at UPS last year.
Last year, two unions representing workers at three large automakers and UPS negotiated new labor contracts that included big raises and other gains. Leaders of the unions -- the United Automobile Workers and the Teamsters -- hoped the wins would help them organize workers across their industry.
The U.A.W. won one vote to unionize a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee last month and lost one this month at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama. The Teamsters have made even less progress at UPS's big nonunion rivals in the delivery business, Amazon and FedEx.
Polling shows that public support for unions is the highest it has been in decades. But labor experts said structural forces would make it hard for labor groups to increase their membership, which is the lowest it has been as a percentage of the total work force in decades. Unions also face stiff opposition from many employers and conservative political leaders.
The Teamsters provide an instructive case study. Many of the workers doing deliveries for Amazon and FedEx work for contractors, typically small and medium-size businesses that can be hard to organize. And delivery workers employed directly by FedEx in its Express business are governed by a labor law that requires unions to organize all similar workers at the company nationally at once -- a tougher standard than the one that applies to organizing employees at automakers, UPS and other employers.
Some labor experts also said the Teamsters had not made as forceful a push as the U.A.W. to organize nonunion workers after securing a new contract with UPS.
"You didn't have that energy that you saw with the U.A.W.'s leaders," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Teamsters officials said the UPS deal, which increases the average annual compensation, including benefits, of a UPS driver to $ 170,000 from $ 145,000, was helping them gain members. At DHL, a delivery company where the union has long had a big presence, the union added 1,100 members last year and is pushing to gain another 1,500. The Teamsters are also pursuing a legal challenge against Amazon that could allow them to gain ground at the company and its contractors.
"It's been very helpful for us to mobilize," Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters' president, said in an interview, referring to the UPS contract. "We've set the standard in the industry."
But the union has also suffered losses. Yellow, a trucking company that employed 24,000 Teamsters, shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Amazon and FedEx said they were confident in their approach to managing and compensating workers. Amazon said it had made investments that bolstered pay and benefits at its delivery contractors. FedEx said its nonunion model allowed it to quickly increase pay whereas UPS's union employees were bound by the terms of five-year contracts.
"Our culture, built and tested over 50 years, is based on the philosophy that if we take care of our people, they will deliver outstanding service for our customers, which will drive business results for our company," Tracy Brightman, FedEx's chief people officer, said in a statement.
Around 310,000 UPS employees belong to the Teamsters. Many of them see FedEx and Amazon drivers on their routes and talk about pay, benefits and working conditions.
"We make much more money than anyone else in the industry," said Essence Carlisle, a part-time package handler at UPS's hub in Louisville, Ky. "I definitely intend to make a career here."
The UPS deal gave part-time employees, over half the company's unionized work force, a 26 percent raise, to at least $ 21 per hour. Ms. Carlisle makes close to $ 24 an hour and works around 20 hours a week, giving her time to run a bakery on the side, she said. Her friends who have full-time driving jobs at Amazon make around $ 19 an hour, she said.
As big as the raises at UPS were, they did not increase pay by a lot more than inflation. The top wage rate immediately after the latest deal, $ 44.25 per hour, was 22 percent higher than five years earlier. Over that period, consumer prices rose 21 percent.
And UPS typically hires new union workers into part-time jobs, which they hold for a few years. As a result, some people may be unwilling to seek a job at the company.
Even so, last year's Teamsters contract was widely discussed online, spawning memes of UPS drivers arriving at customers' doors in designer clothing.
"Joking or not, everybody was like, 'Hey, man, I need a job at UPS,"' said Juan Martinez, a UPS driver in Southern California.
Under the new contract, Mr. Martinez expects to earn $ 110,000 to $ 120,000 a year, depending on how much overtime he gets, he said. He said his income allowed him to spend more on his children's education.
Under the Teamsters' deal with UPS, the top hourly wage will increase to $ 49 by the end of the five-year contract. Amazon said in January that the average pay of workers at its delivery contractors was $ 20.50 in the United States. FedEx declined to provide an average wage rate for its delivery workers.
Despite UPS's superior pay over the years, the Teamsters have not made many inroads at FedEx or Amazon.
The high turnover of delivery and warehouse workers at Amazon and FedEx -- where each part-time position was on average filled and vacated twice last year -- makes it difficult to organize them.
Another challenge is that delivery workers at Amazon, and drivers who deliver for FedEx Ground, are employed by contractors. Mr. Rosenfeld, the labor academic, said trying to organize a few dozen people at each contractor could be time consuming and costly.
Last year, 84 workers at an Amazon contractor near Los Angeles joined the Teamsters. But days earlier, Amazon terminated the contract with the operator, Battle-Tested Strategies, the company said, for failing to follow proper safety procedures, among other things.
The Teamsters asked the National Labor Relations Board to rule that Amazon was a joint employer of the workers and order the company to reinstate the contract. The board has yet to rule.
A favorable ruling would be "a massive deal" and an "inspiration for thousands of other workers across the country," said Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official.
Johnathon Ervin, the owner of Battle-Tested Strategies, said he believed Amazon had terminated the contract, which led to job losses for all his employees, because of the unionization effort. An Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Kate Paradis, disputed that.
Mr. Ervin said the minimum pay for his workers under the Amazon contract was $ 19.75. "If you are asking people to make this a career, you should have better work conditions and pay the drivers more," said Mr. Ervin, a 26-year Air Force veteran.
Amazon didn't respond directly to that criticism. The company noted that its contractors, which it refers to as delivery service partners, had created 279,000 driving jobs over the last five years.
"Helping D.S.P.s create a good overall working experience is important to us, which is why we've invested more than $ 8 billion in state-of-the-art technology, safety features, rates, programs and services for Amazon D.S.P.s and their drivers," Ms. Paradis said in a statement.
Labor groups have made some gains at Amazon, including organizing workers at a Staten Island warehouse. But Amazon is challenging the election there, and that union has been embroiled in infighting.
At FedEx there is another potential barrier to unionization.
FedEx was founded as an airline, and employees of its Express business come under the Railway Labor Act, which requires unions to organize nationally, across a whole company, at once. Union officials say it's easier to hold individual votes at each company location as allowed under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs workers at UPS and automakers.
Even so, some FedEx employees do belong to a union. Nearly 6,000 pilots at FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The Teamsters are trying to organize the mechanics who work on the company's planes.
FedEx said its delivery workers had benefited from not being in a union because the company raised wages significantly during the home-delivery boom of 2021 and 2022, when UPS workers' raises were set by an agreement reached before the pandemic. A FedEx spokeswoman noted that the company incurred an additional $ 1.4 billion in labor costs in its 2022 fiscal year.

Last year, two unions representing workers at three large automakers and UPS negotiated new labor contracts that included big raises and other gains. Leaders of the unions — the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters — hoped the wins would help them organize workers across their industry.
The UAW won one vote to unionize a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee last month and lost one this month at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama. The Teamsters have made even less progress at UPS’ big nonunion rivals in the delivery business, Amazon and FedEx.
Polling shows that public support for unions is the highest it has been in decades. But labor experts said structural forces would make it hard for labor groups to increase their membership, which is the lowest it has been as a percentage of the total workforce in decades. Unions also face stiff opposition from many employers and conservative political leaders.
The Teamsters provide an instructive case study. Many of the workers doing deliveries for Amazon and FedEx work for contractors, typically small and medium-size businesses that can be hard to organize. And delivery workers employed directly by FedEx in its Express business are governed by a labor law that requires unions to organize all similar workers at the company nationally at once — a tougher standard than the one that applies to organizing employees at automakers, UPS and other employers.
Some labor experts also said the Teamsters had not made as forceful a push as the UAW to organize nonunion workers after securing a new contract with UPS.
“You didn’t have that energy that you saw with the UAW’s leaders,” said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Teamsters officials said the UPS deal, which increases the average annual compensation, including benefits, of a UPS driver to $170,000 from $145,000, was helping them gain members. At DHL, a delivery company where the union has long had a big presence, the union added 1,100 members last year and is pushing to gain another 1,500. The Teamsters are also pursuing a legal challenge against Amazon that could allow them to gain ground at the company and its contractors.
“It’s been very helpful for us to mobilize,” Sean O’Brien, the Teamsters’ president, said in an interview, referring to the UPS contract. “We’ve set the standard in the industry.”
But the union has also suffered losses. Yellow, a trucking company that employed 24,000 Teamsters, shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Amazon and FedEx said they were confident in their approach to managing and compensating workers. Amazon said it had made investments that bolstered pay and benefits at its delivery contractors. FedEx said its nonunion model allowed it to quickly increase pay whereas UPS’ union employees were bound by the terms of five-year contracts.
“Our culture, built and tested over 50 years, is based on the philosophy that if we take care of our people, they will deliver outstanding service for our customers, which will drive business results for our company,” Tracy Brightman, FedEx’s chief people officer, said in a statement,
Around 310,000 UPS employees belong to the Teamsters. Many of them see FedEx and Amazon drivers on their routes and talk about pay, benefits and working conditions.
“We make much more money than anyone else in the industry,” said Essence Carlisle, a part-time package handler at UPS’ hub in Louisville, Kentucky. “I definitely intend to make a career here.”
The UPS deal gave part-time employees, over half the company’s unionized workforce, a 26% raise, to at least $21 per hour. Carlisle makes close to $24 an hour and works around 20 hours a week, giving her time to run a bakery on the side, she said. Her friends who have full-time driving jobs at Amazon make around $19 an hour, she said.
As big as the raises at UPS were, they did not increase pay by a lot more than inflation. The top wage rate immediately after the latest deal, $44.25 per hour, was 22% higher than five years earlier. Over that period, consumer prices rose 21%.
And UPS typically hires new union workers into part-time jobs, which they hold for a few years. As a result, some people may be unwilling to seek a job at the company.
Even so, last year’s Teamsters contract was widely discussed online, spawning memes of UPS drivers arriving at customers’ doors in designer clothing.
“Joking or not, everybody was like, ‘Hey, man, I need a job at UPS,’” said Juan Martinez, a UPS driver in Southern California.
Under the new contract, Martinez expects to earn $110,000 to $120,000 a year, depending on how much overtime he gets, he said. He said his income allowed him to spend more on his children’s education.
Under the Teamsters’ deal with UPS, the top hourly wage will increase to $49 by the end of the five-year contract. Amazon said in January that the average pay of workers at its delivery contractors was $20.50 in the United States. FedEx declined to provide an average wage rate for its delivery workers.
Despite UPS’ superior pay over the years, the Teamsters have not made many inroads at FedEx or Amazon.
The high turnover of delivery and warehouse workers at Amazon and FedEx — where each part-time position was on average filled and vacated twice last year — makes it difficult to organize them.
Another challenge is that delivery workers at Amazon, and drivers who deliver for FedEx Ground, are employed by contractors. Rosenfeld said trying to organize a few dozen people at each contractor could be time consuming and costly.
Last year, 84 workers at an Amazon contractor near Los Angeles joined the Teamsters. But days earlier, Amazon terminated the contract with the operator, Battle-Tested Strategies, the company said, for failing to follow proper safety procedures, among other things.
The Teamsters asked the National Labor Relations Board to rule that Amazon was a joint employer of the workers and order the company to reinstate the contract. The board has yet to rule.
A favorable ruling would be “a massive deal” and an “inspiration for thousands of other workers across the country,” said Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official.
Johnathon Ervin, the owner of Battle-Tested Strategies, said he believed Amazon had terminated the contract, which led to job losses for all his employees, because of the unionization effort. An Amazon spokesperson, Mary Kate Paradis, disputed that.
Ervin said the minimum pay for his workers under the Amazon contract was $19.75. “If you are asking people to make this a career, you should have better work conditions and pay the drivers more,” said Ervin, a 26-year Air Force veteran.
Amazon didn’t respond directly to that criticism. The company noted that its contractors, which it refers to as delivery service partners, had created 279,000 driving jobs over the last five years.
“Helping DSPs create a good overall working experience is important to us, which is why we’ve invested more than $8 billion in state-of-the-art technology, safety features, rates, programs and services for Amazon DSPs and their drivers,” Paradis said in a statement.
Labor groups have made some gains at Amazon, including organizing workers at a Staten Island warehouse. But Amazon is challenging the election there, and that union has been embroiled in infighting.
At FedEx, there is another potential barrier to unionization.
FedEx was founded as an airline, and employees of its Express business come under the Railway Labor Act, which requires unions to organize nationally, across a whole company, at once. Union officials say it’s easier to hold individual votes at each company location as allowed under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs workers at UPS and automakers.
Even so, some FedEx employees do belong to a union. Nearly 6,000 pilots at FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The Teamsters are trying to organize the mechanics who work on the company’s planes.
FedEx said its delivery workers had benefited from not being in a union because the company raised wages significantly during the home-delivery boom of 2021 and 2022, when UPS workers’ raises were set by an agreement reached before the pandemic. A FedEx spokesperson noted that the company incurred an additional $1.4 billion in labor costs in its 2022 fiscal year.

Judge Bans Some Evidence Against Menendez: [National Desk]

Full text: The ruling could undermine prosecutors' ability to prove certain elements of the bribery case against Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat.
In a potential setback for the government, a federal judge on Friday blocked the introduction of certain evidence that prosecutors wanted to use to support their case that Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey accepted bribes in exchange for approving billions of dollars in aid to Egypt.
The judge's order, which comes two weeks into Mr. Menendez's corruption trial in Manhattan, could undermine prosecutors' ability to prove certain elements of the multifaceted bribery charges against the senator.
The ruling rests on protections afforded to members of Congress under the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause, which bars the government from citing specific legislative actions in seeking to prove a federal lawmaker committed a crime.
The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York has said it intended to sidestep discussion of official legislative acts and focus instead on promises it says preceded Mr. Menendez's votes and congressional actions.
The judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, ruled in March that although Mr. Menendez's performance of a legislative act was protected conduct, "his promise to do the same is not."
The judge's one-page ruling Friday concerned prosecutors' proposed exhibits. One set pertained to a message from an Egyptian official to Wael Hana, one of the senator's co-defendants, asking if it was true that Mr. Menendez was holding up $ 1 billion of U.S. aid to Egypt.
The other concerned a link to an article reporting on two pending foreign military sales to Egypt totaling about $ 2.5 billion, which Mr. Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, forwarded to Mr. Hana, writing, "Bob had to sign off on this."
Judge Stein ruled that the references to prior holds and signoffs would be precluded as evidence against Mr. Menendez.
The senator's lawyers, Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, said in a statement that they were "pleased to see the court rein in the prosecutors' attempts to circumvent the Constitution's protections for the people's elected representatives."
Nicholas Biase, a Southern District spokesman, declined to comment.
Josh Chafetz, a law professor at Georgetown University who studies legislative procedure and the separation of powers, said the "speech or debate" clause "serves the really important purpose of giving members of Congress breathing room to go about doing their business in a way that can't be interfered with by the executive branch and by the courts."
In a hearing Tuesday, a prosecutor, Paul M. Monteleoni, acknowledged the challenges posed by the constitutional provision. "The principle that this is designed to make the government's life harder, to an extent -- that applies," he said.
"But it is also not designed to make members of Congress super citizens immune from all criminal responsibility," he added.
Ever since the charges against Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, were announced last year, he and his lawyers have argued that prosecutors were seeking to criminalize routine legislative activity.
Mr. Menendez, his wife, Mr. Hana and another New Jersey businessman have all been charged with conspiring to pay bribes to the couple in exchange for the senator's efforts to meddle with criminal cases in New Jersey, steer aid and weapons to Egypt and to help prop up Mr. Hana's halal meat monopoly. They have all pleaded not guilty.
Investigators seized more than $ 480,000 in cash, 13 gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz convertible during a June 2022 search of the couple's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
Joseph A. Hayden Jr., a criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey, called the ruling a "significant legal victory" that could help to "chip away" at the government's case.

U.A.W. Asks Officials to Redo Union Vote at Alabama Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The union, which lost an organizing vote at two factories last week, argued to federal officials that the automaker had violated labor laws.
A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials on Friday to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Mercedes-Benz conducted a "relentless anti-union campaign" marked by "wanton lawlessness," the U.A.W. said in a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board. Among other things, the union said, Mercedes fired four employees who supported the union, prevented pro-union employees from campaigning and forced employees to watch anti-union videos.
Workers at the Mercedes factories outside Tuscaloosa, which manufacture sport utility vehicles and battery packs, voted 56 percent to 44 percent against joining the union. But the labor board can order a new election if, after a hearing, a regional director determines that improper conduct by an employer affected the vote, a spokeswoman for the board said.
Mercedes denied that it had used improper methods to defeat the union drive. A majority of workers "indicated they are not interested in being represented by the U.A.W.," the company said in a statement on Friday.
"Throughout the election, we worked with the N.L.R.B. to adhere to its guidelines, and we will continue to do so," Mercedes said.
The Alabama result interrupted a string of victories by the U.A.W. in the South, including persuading a large majority of the workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., to vote to join the union and securing substantial pay raises in a new contract with Daimler Truck in North Carolina.
Organizing workers in Southern states, which have long been hostile to unions, is a high priority for the U.A.W. The region is attracting a large share of the billions of dollars that companies are investing in electric-car and battery factories.
By the same token, Southern elected leaders like Alabama's governor, Kay Ivey, a Republican, have worked to keep unions out, seeing them as a threat to their ability to attract more factories and jobs.

Yellen Warns China Excess Is Grave Risk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned that China's industrial strategy posed a global threat that requires a united response.
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Tuesday that the United States and Europe needed to work together to push back against China's excess industrial capacity, warning that a wave of cheap Chinese exports represents a grave threat to the global economy.
Ms. Yellen's remarks, delivered during a speech in Germany, highlighted what is expected to be a central topic of discussion when the Group of 7 finance ministers meet in Italy this week.
"China's industrial policy may seem remote as we sit here in this room, but if we do not respond strategically and in a united way, the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk," Ms. Yellen said at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, where she received an honorary doctoral degree.
China's excessive production of green energy technology has become a pressing trans-Atlantic concern in recent months. Officials in President Biden's administration have grown increasingly worried that his efforts to finance domestic manufacturing of clean energy and other next-generation technologies will be undercut by China, which is churning out steel, electric cars and solar panels at a rapid clip.
The Biden administration is now looking to Europe to help the developed world prevent the kind of China shock of the early 2000s, which helped decimate manufacturing in exchange for cheap goods. Last week, Mr. Biden increased tariffs on some Chinese imports, including levying a 100 percent tax on electric vehicles. He also formally left in place levies on more than $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods that President Donald J. Trump had imposed.
The United States hopes that a united front will convince China that its largest trading partners are prepared to erect trade barriers that will prevent Chinese electric vehicles, batteries and panels from dominating Western markets.
Ms. Yellen emphasized on Tuesday that the United States was not trying to carry out an anti-China policy, but said China's actions posed a threat to the global economy that warranted a coordinated response.
She pointed to China's push to dominate clean energy technology and other sectors, saying that ambition "could also prevent countries around the world, including emerging markets, from building the industries that could power their growth."
The trend toward protectionist policies is likely to become another point of contention between China and the world's most advanced economies. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, derided Mr. Biden's decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods last week as a "political maneuver."
"We hope the U.S. can take a positive view of China's development and stop using overcapacity as an excuse for trade protectionism," Mr. Liu said.
The new U.S. tariffs could put additional pressure on Europe to erect trade barriers of its own to prevent China from redirecting more of its exports there. Europe's officials are already considering additional levies on Chinese cars, which pose a particular threat to Germany.
About 37 percent of all electric vehicle imports to Europe are produced in China, including Chinese brands and ones made by Tesla and German automakers with plants there. Europe is the world's second-biggest E.V. market, and imports there skyrocketed last year to $ 11.5 billion, from $ 1.6 billion in 2020.
The European Commission is investigating whether Chinese state subsidies intended to help the country's companies make cheap cars are damaging Europe's auto industry. The sector provides nearly 14 million direct and indirect jobs in Europe, and the six million cars that it exported last year generated a trade surplus of more than 100 billion euros.
Europe's investigation could result in preliminary duties on Chinese electric vehicle imports as soon as July, though any tariffs are likely to be far lower than the 100 percent imposed by the Biden administration. But unlike Europe, which is already importing cars from China, the United States has erected several barriers to prevent Chinese E.V.s from coming to its shores.
Europe's investigation into China's subsidies and whether they merit tariffs has aggravated a political divide. Some countries, such as Germany, which is Europe's biggest maker of electric cars, have been against an investigation. German officials are wary of pressing penalties that might incite Beijing to shut out German carmakers such as BMW and Volkswagen.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a speech in Stockholm last week, "We should not forget: European manufacturers, and also some American ones, are successful on the Chinese market and also sell a lot of vehicles that are produced in Europe to China." He added that at least half of electric vehicles imported to Europe from China were Western brands.
Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has been pushing for "de-risking" Europe's relationship with China. Her approach is backed by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who hosted his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, this month and has urged Brussels to step up protection against what his administration sees as unfair Chinese competition.
The Brussels investigation has focused less on whether China is dumping large numbers of cars into Europe and more on how subsidies have allowed E.V.s made by BYD, Geely and SAIC, the three biggest Chinese E.V. makers, to offer cut-rate prices. The Chinese government has criticized the European Union for not investigating Western brands with factories in China -- including Tesla, which exports more E.V.s from China to the European Union than any other producer.
The Rhodium Group, an independent think tank that focuses on China, said that to compensate for Chinese state subsidies, the European Commission would have to impose duties of up to 50 percent on Chinese E.V.s. But the group suggested that such a move would be unlikely in Europe unless officials took a more "drastic" review of World Trade Organization rules, and suggested that tariff rates of 15 to 30 percent were more realistic.
In the meantime, Chinese electric vehicle makers, including BYD and Great Wall Motor, are setting up factories in Hungary to build cars that would be viewed as European-made products, which could raise trade issues eventually with the United States.
The Biden administration is watching with similar concern as Chinese car companies invest in factories in Mexico, which could potentially be used to enter the U.S. market.
Following her speech, Ms. Yellen told reporters that the United States and countries in Europe have different concerns when it comes to commerce with China and, as a result, they could use different tools to address them. But she added that because many of the concerns about China's heavy subsidization of exports are broadly shared, it is "more forceful to communicate to China as a group."
The approach by the United States and Europe to work together to confront China does pose the risk of retaliation, inflaming trade tensions that could weigh on the world economy. Chinese officials said last week that they would respond to the new trade measures imposed by the United States.
In an interview with The New York Times this week, Ms. Yellen argued that the new U.S. tariffs were targeted and that she did not believe that China wanted to escalate tensions.
"I anticipate some response on China's part, but my hope is that it's moderate and proportional," Ms. Yellen said.

U.A.W. Loss At Mercedes Was a Blow: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After Mercedes workers voted against joining the United Automobile Workers, the union will have less momentum as it campaigns to organize Southern factories.
After suffering a setback at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama on Friday, the United Automobile Workers union's efforts to organize other auto factories in the South are likely to slow and could struggle to make headway.
About 56 percent of the Mercedes workers who voted rejected the U.A.W. in an election after the union chalked up two major wins this year. In April, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted to join the union, the first large nonunion auto plant in the South to do so. Weeks later, the union negotiated a new contract bringing significant pay and benefit improvements for its members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.
"Losing at Mercedes is not death for the union," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means they'll have less confidence going to the next plant. The U.A.W. is in it for the long run. I don't think they're going to stop just because they lost here."
Since its founding in 1935, the U.A.W. has almost exclusively represented workers employed by the three Michigan-based automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis. And it has long struggled to make headway at plants owned by foreign manufacturers, especially in Southern states where anti-union sentiment runs deep.
Workers at the Volkswagen plant had voted against being represented by the U.A.W. twice by narrow margins before the recent union win there. An effort a decade ago to organize one of the Mercedes plants failed to build enough support for an election.
Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that broad union organizing efforts seldom proceeded smoothly. In the 1930s, the U.A.W. won recognition at G.M. and Chrysler but struggled at Ford, which continued employing nonunion workers for a few years.
"I have no doubt they will continue organizing and eventually try for another vote," he said.
In its past efforts in the South, the union was hampered by a negative image, which may have also played a part in the U.A.W.'s loss at Mercedes. For years, the three Michigan automakers were cutting jobs and closing plants, in part because of rigid and costly labor contracts. The union was also hurt by corruption cases that put several former senior officials, including two former U.A.W. presidents, behind bars.
Business leaders in Alabama ran a campaign against the U.A.W. that was based in part on the contention that the union was responsible for the decline of Detroit. In a January opinion essay published in The Alabama Daily News, the chief executive of the Business Council of Alabama, Helena Duncan, said the state would suffer the same fate if workers voted for the union.
"Much of the decay that exists in the 'Motor City' today results from untenable demands that the U.A.W. placed on its automobile manufacturers, an unwise move that sent untold numbers of jobs to right-to-work states like ours and crippled a once great metropolis," Ms. Duncan wrote.
A year ago, the union elected a new president, Shawn Fain, who was untouched by the corruption scandals and vowed to take a more aggressive approach in contract talks. Then last fall, the union came away with substantial pay and benefit gains in negotiations with the Detroit automakers, after targeted strikes over some 40 days. Hundreds of Southern autoworkers began reaching out, asking for help organizing their nonunion plants. The U.A.W. responded by announcing that it would spend $ 40 million on organizing drives over the next two years.
"I'm not scared at all," Mr. Fain said Friday in Alabama after the union lost the Mercedes vote. "I believe workers want unions, I believe they want justice, and we're going to continue doing what we can do."
Mercedes in a statement emphasized its direct relationship with workers and said it looked forward to making sure the company was "not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family."
The union has signaled that it expects to focus its organizing efforts on another Alabama plant -- a Hyundai factory in Montgomery. But organizing that plant will probably be even harder than the campaign at the Mercedes factories, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry.
The U.A.W. had allies at Volkswagen and Mercedes. Unions are powerful players in Germany, where those two companies are based. Under German law, worker representatives must occupy half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
Volkswagen and Mercedes both have groups called works councils through which managers and employees discuss and negotiate workplace issues and production plans. In its drive at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. had the support of the company's works council and IG Metall, the powerful union that represents all German automotive workers.
The U.A.W. won't have that kind of support at Hyundai's Montgomery plant, Mr. Gordon said. "In general, Korean car companies have more adversarial relationships with unions than do the German manufacturers," he said. "Korean companies are less used to sitting together in a conference room with unions."
Last year, weeks after the U.A.W. won pay and benefit increases from the three Michigan-based automakers, Hyundai announced that it would increase its workers' pay sharply over the next four years -- a move widely seen as an attempt to dampen workers' interest in joining the U.A.W.
"The decision to be represented by a union is up to our team members," Hyundai said in a statement.
The Montgomery plant makes two popular sport utility vehicles -- the Tucson and Santa Fe -- and employs about 4,000 workers. An earlier U.A.W. drive to organize the plant in 2016 petered out without coming to a vote.
Last fall, the union said it planned to target plants owned by 10 foreign-owned automakers -- Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo -- and others owned by Tesla, which is based in Texas, and two smaller electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, both based in California.
The U.S. plants owned by those foreign and U.S. companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
In Alabama, however, the U.A.W. faced perhaps a more hostile environment than anywhere else. While it was campaigning at Mercedes, Gov. Kay Ivey spoke out against the union and headed a group of six Southern governors, all Republicans, who issued a letter suggesting unionizing could cause automakers to move jobs out of their states. One senior Alabama politician described the U.A.W. as "leeches."
Mercedes brought in Nick Saban, the hugely popular former football coach at the University of Alabama, to talk to workers in an effort to persuade them to vote against the U.A.W.
Unions are traditionally seen as a Northern institution and are often linked with the civil rights movement, which alienates many people in Alabama, Mr. Gordon said. "It's a very tough place for the U.A.W.," he said.
That antipathy could also make it hard for the U.A.W. to negotiate contracts guaranteeing its members raises and other gains even if it wins unionizing votes. Lawmakers who oppose unions may put pressure on employers not to make big concessions in negotiations.
Mr. Fain and the U.A.W. have argued that unions are the best way for workers to demand higher wages when automakers are enjoying strong sales and profits in North America.
Public support of unions is stronger than it has been in years, including in the South. This year, 600 workers at an electric bus factory in Alabama voted to join the Communications Workers of America union. A week ago, they negotiated a new contract delivering pay raises and enhanced benefits.
The U.A.W. and other unions also have enjoyed the support of President Biden, who last fall joined striking autoworkers on a picket line in Michigan. The union endorsed Mr. Biden in this year's election.
But that close association with the president may also hurt the U.A.W. with conservative workers in a Southern state who prefer Mr. Biden's opponent -- former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Fain and Mr. Trump have often criticized each other, but polls have shown that a sizable minority of union households support the former president.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The vote determined whether 1,700 workers who play characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and who dance at parades could join the union representing other workers at the park in Anaheim, Calif.
A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance in parades at the amusement park, in California, voted to unionize with the Actors' Equity Association on Saturday, the union said.
The Actors' Equity Association, the national labor union that represents more than 51,000 professional actors and stage managers, said it had exceeded the threshold it needed in a vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, winning a 79 percent majority with 953 yes votes and 258 no votes, according to a statement.
Among the key issues that brought workers together to fight for representation in future negotiations with the company were securing improvements in safety and scheduling and demanding "a living wage," as well as other workplace benefits, the union said.
"They say that Disneyland is 'the place where dreams come true,' and for the Disney cast members who have worked to organize a union, their dream came true today," Kate Shindle, the actor association's president, said in a statement on Saturday.
In a statement on Sunday, a Disneyland spokeswoman said that "it is premature for the company to comment on the results."
Union leaders had already counted a symbolic victory in bringing together the workers who define the park's experience for the many visitors who interact and take photos with the beloved Disney characters.
"These workers are on the front lines of the guest experience; they're the human beings who create lifelong memories when your kids hug a character, or when your family watches a parade roll by the castle," Ms. Shindle added.
The unionization vote comes after other recent organizing efforts involving entertainment and large companies nationwide. In September, the Writers Guild of America, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, reached a tentative deal on a new contract with entertainment companies, ending a monthslong strike that, along with a simultaneous actors' strike, had shut down television and film production.
On Friday, about 56 percent of workers at Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama voted to reject the United Automobile Workers' push to organize, despite successful unionization campaigns elsewhere in the South, in Tennessee and North Carolina, this year. And in March, Starbucks and the union that represents its workers, Workers United, said they were beginning discussions about a "foundational framework" to help them reach labor agreements.
The Disneyland vote determined whether a group of 1,700 workers at Anaheim, Calif., who play characters, dance in parades, interact with park guests and train performers, could join the union. Most of the resort's work force was already unionized.
The union represents performers and stage managers at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., as well as those with Disney Theatrical Group on Broadway and who work on national tours.
If there are no challenges to Saturday's vote, the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board will certify the results within a week, the union said, adding that the result of future negotiations will create a better experience for both workers and guests.
The Disneyland Resort, which opened in 1955, includes Disneyland Park and Disney's California Adventure, three hotels and Downtown Disney, according to the union.

Protectionist Trade Policies Are Popular, but Some Economists Say They Don't Work: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Protectionist trade policies are popular on both the left and right. But some economists say they're likely to backfire.
No matter who wins the White House and control of Congress this autumn, one aspect of trade policy is likely to endure: Washington's tough-on-China protectionist stance. But several trade experts predict that the America-first model of slapping tariffs on adversaries -- as President Biden did this week -- will backfire.
Critics of tariffs and export restrictions say they not only will potentially exacerbate inflation and drag down economic growth, but are also likely to fail for a simpler reason: Chinese companies may see their businesses slowed down by the restrictions, but have found ways to beat them.
As Alex Durante, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank that works with policymakers in the United States and Europe, bluntly put it: "They don't work."
Huawei has shown that companies can find workarounds. Last year, the Chinese telecom giant unveiled the Mate 60, a smartphone powered by a high-end semiconductor. The new product raised eyebrows in Washington because the advanced chip was precisely the kind of technology that the Biden administration was trying to keep out of China's hands through the passage of the CHIPS Act a year earlier.
Huawei's breakthrough was less a breach of international trade rules than a result of a company's using a web of gray channels to get the banned materials it needed to make the chips, concluded Douglas Fuller, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School. "America's flimsy controls" of those suppliers helped Huawei, he wrote in a recent research report.
A similar approach could work for electric vehicles. Among the $ 18 billion worth of increased tariffs on Chinese-made goods that Biden announced this week, E.V.s were a major focus. The levies jumped to 100 percent from 25 percent.
Analysts expect to see Chinese E.V. companies ramping up production in Mexico to circumvent Biden's import taxes. Trade chiefs are already eyeing that loophole, suggesting this phase of the trade war will feel like a game of Whac-a-Mole. (Relatively few Chinese E.V.s are sold in the United States, but the domestic industry fears they will soon flood the market as they've done in Europe.)
Free-market boosters say trade barriers pack other problems. Protectionist trade policies tend to stifle competition, limit consumer choice and drive up prices, Joachim Klement, the head of investment strategy at Liberum, an investment bank, told DealBook. (Even some within the Biden administration acknowledge there's a link between tariffs and prices.)
Another critique: Tariffs under Biden and President Donald Trump are expected to be a drag on economic growth and the labor market, the Tax Foundation calculates.
Both political parties embrace anti-China policies. Like Trump before him, Biden has justified increased tariffs by accusing China of "flooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports" and has framed them as a way to bolster national security, defend American economic interests and "protect American workers and companies." As the TikTok divest-or-ban law shows, restricting Chinese tech in the United States is one of the few areas that unite a fractious Congress.
The number of protectionist policies by governments around the world has exploded since the U.S.-Chinese trade war kicked off under Trump, but not all are exclusively focused on tariffs. Sweeping industrial policies such as the Inflation Reduction and CHIPS Acts use a mix of tax breaks, subsidies and export restrictions to build up strategic sectors such as semiconductors and green technologies locally at the expense of foreign rivals.
Companies often have a say in how industrial policies are shaped. "The system can be gamed by industry lobbyists," Klement noted. The upshot: The legislation is watered down, potentially introducing loopholes that even trade foes can exploit.
So what works? Economists who favor free markets tend to see greater potential in industrial policies that are more carrot and less stick. Rather than policies that restrict trade, for example, they prefer measures that offer businesses low-interest loans and grants designed to stimulate investment in research and development. Such incentives, over time, tend to fuel innovation and economic growth, Klement said. "They tend not to be inflationary," he added. It should be noted that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the IRA and CHIPS acts include such provisions for companies and research institutions.
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, told DealBook something similar this week, pointing to the Cold War space race as an example. Back then, Washington threw its support behind universities and research centers to achieve its moonshot ambitions and fend off rival nations. -- Bernhard Warner
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama rejected a union. Workers at two Mercedes factories near Tuscaloosa voted against being represented by the United Automobile Workers. The election was seen as a test of whether the U.A.W. could build on a string of recent victories to unionize factories in the South, where political leaders have fiercely opposed organized labor.
OpenAI and Google unveiled new A.I. technologies. Google began rolling out AI Overviews, which puts A.I.-generated summaries ahead of links in its search results, and OpenAI announced major updates to its ChatGPT chatbot. A day later, OpenAI announced the departure of Ilya Sutskever, its chief scientist and co-founder, who helped lead the rebellion that briefly ousted Sam Altman as the company's C.E.O.
Stocks soared to record highs. After a better-than-expected Consumer Price Index report, which showed so-called core inflation rising by its lowest level in three years, the S&P 500 rose to a record. The Dow Jones industrial average also passed a milestone this week, climbing above 40,000 for the first time.
Whither meme stock mania 2.0?
The beginning of the week felt like 2021 all over again. Driven by a burst in activity on @TheRoaringKitty, the X account belonging to the trader Keith Gill, who became the face of "meme stock" mania, shares in companies including GameStop and the theater chain AMC Entertainment shot up for a few days.
Analysts and commentators have struggled to make sense of the brief resurgence in retail-fueled stock speculation. Was it a sign of overexuberance about the markets? That Wall Street is better prepared to handle sudden-onset trading manias? That Gill may not actually own the account anymore? Or maybe, given the stock boom's ephemerality ... nothing at all?
John Mackey's next act
John Mackey, the Whole Foods co-founder who ran the company for 44 years, says building a business is like having a baby: "You're creating something from nothing, and it's very soul satisfying." And that's what he tried to convey in his upcoming book, "The Whole Story," which recounts how a single store grew into the giant upscale grocery chain that Amazon acquired for $ 13.4 billion in 2017. DealBook talked with Mackey about the merger, "conscious capitalism" and the health start-up that he's opening in July. The interview has been condensed and edited.
In the book, you describe a solo retreat where you processed anger over the ways in which you "felt disrespected and disempowered since the sale of Whole Foods to Amazon." Do you regret selling Whole Foods?
I regret the circumstances that made selling the company and Amazon the best option. If I had to do it over again, I would make the same decision. But of course, I wish we hadn't been in that circumstance in the first place, where we had shareholder activists who were trying to take over our company.
You also mention the fallout from writing an op-ed about Obamacare in 2009, which led to protests against Whole Foods and hundreds of letters to the board calling for your resignation. C.E.O.s have since come under more pressure to speak out about social and political issues. What do you think they should do?
Stay out of politics. People are going to wrongly assume that if a C.E.O. takes a position on an issue, the company is taking a position on the issue. You are running the risk that you're going to be demonized, and your business is going to be attacked.
Is staying out of politics becoming harder to do, as employees and customers demand that business leaders take a stance?
I stayed out of all the controversies that happened after George Floyd, which got a lot of C.E.O.s speaking up and then created a lot of blowback. You should take a stand if it's directly related to what your business is about. So Whole Foods took stands on, say, organic produce or regenerative agriculture. I think that's quite appropriate.
It's been more than 10 years since you published "Conscious Capitalism," your book that argues businesses can create value for all stakeholders, including society. If you were writing it again today, is there anything that you would change?
I'm actually worried about conscious capitalism because I think it's being attacked by both the left and the right for different reasons. The traditional capitalists are attacking it because they're worried that conscious capitalism is going to take away control of corporations from the owners and redistribute power, so to speak, to stakeholder groups. That you'll have a labor union on the board, a customer representative on the board.
And then on the other side, you've got people that are weaponizing conscious capitalism to change the power structure of businesses. I think businesses do have a purpose besides only maximizing profits, but making money is a very important purpose of business. It's not like you throw that away. It's just that it's not the only reason business exists.
Conscious capitalism is not a political statement. It's a business management philosophy. And I think that's where people mostly misunderstand it. It's not about redistributing power. It's about how to manage the business to create more value in the world.
Your new start-up, Love.Life, describes itself as a "holistic health and wellness club." Why start a new company at 70?
We're going to have a healthy food restaurant, a fitness center, a spa, yoga, Pilates. We're going to have pickleball courts, a medical center that focuses on functional, integrative and lifestyle medicine.
My heart calls me to do it. I want to do it. And finally, even at age 70, it's fun.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.
We'd like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.

An Ex-President and a Sitting Senator Are on Trial Just a Block Apart: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Manhattan is playing host to two of the biggest political trials in American history. The courthouses are just 500 feet apart.
At one corner of Baxter Street in Lower Manhattan this week, former President Donald J. Trump transformed a shabby New York courthouse where he's on trial into the backdrop for his comeback campaign. He vented to a lineup of cameras. The speaker of the House stopped by. Supporters waved purple and red Trump flags through a spring mist.
Things were far quieter just down the block, but still plenty noteworthy. There, at a different courthouse, another uncommonly high-powered defendant, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, shuffled silently through a metal detector each morning to face his own criminal trial.
The two men -- one a Republican, one a Democrat -- are longtime political adversaries with far different styles and stories. Their cases share little beyond tawdriness, with one centered on a hush-money payment to a porn star and the other on alleged bribes paid in gold bars.
But in an extraordinary twist, the paths to their fates have physically crossed this week, with the prosecution of a former president playing out all of 500 feet from where another jury of New Yorkers began hearing one of the gravest cases ever leveled against a sitting U.S. senator.
New York City is no stranger to blockbuster court dramas, many of them clustered like these in a dense neighborhood of courthouses and lockups once known as the Five Points. Alger Hiss's perjury trial in 1949 helped set the tone for the Cold War. Prosecutors picked apart the mafia and then Al Qaeda in courthouses here. There have been too many political corruption cases to count.
And yet, even by the standards of Manhattan -- a tiny island where titans of business, prizewinning artists and heads of state jockey for restaurant booths and mingle at parties -- the simultaneous trials have left judges, historians and court watchers alike grasping for anything close to a precedent.
"I can't think of another time where you have had two major criminal trials, both involving political figures, vying for the front page like this," said Robert Pigott, a lawyer and legal historian who leads walking tours of the court district.
"Usually one is enough," he added.
The trial of Mr. Trump, 77, is the bigger spectacle, attracting a who's who of Republican politics, weekslong gavel-to-gavel live news coverage, and waves of rallies and counter protests. On Thursday, a supporter released dozens of pink, phallus-shaped balloons bearing pictures of the judge and district attorney handling the case.
The stakes are significant, even if the charges -- falsifying business records about the hush money payment -- sound dry. Mr. Trump, his party's presumptive nominee, is hoping his case will be only a speed bump on his road back to the White House. But a conviction could eventually put him behind bars, even as he still faces three more criminal trials in Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C.
The charges against Mr. Menendez, 70, are weightier. Federal prosecutors asserted in court this week that as a leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he "put his power up for sale," helping Egypt and New Jersey businessmen in exchange for lucrative bribes, like the gold and a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible. But while he is fighting for his legacy and freedom, even the senator's closest allies agree that his political career is probably over.
In Washington, the two men were mostly partisan enemies. The senator twice voted to convict the former president on impeachment charges and once suggested that Mr. Trump was "compromised" by Russia. He maintained he was "unfit" even after Mr. Trump commuted the sentence of Mr. Menendez's friend and former co-defendant in an earlier corruption case.
But trying times make for odd bedfellows. In September, not long after the senator was himself charged with covertly helping a foreign power, Mr. Trump expressed something like sympathy. He said the senator, like him, had been subject to "an attack" by the Justice Department because he "wasn't getting along too well" with the Biden administration.
Both have maintained their innocence.
Mr. Trump is on trial on the 15th floor of the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse at 100 Centre Street, a state court near the meeting point of Chinatown, Little Italy and TriBeCa. Mr. Menendez's case is being heard on the 23rd floor of the nearby Daniel Patrick Moynihan Federal Courthouse. (Mr. Trump knows that building well: He lost a defamation case there earlier this year to the writer E. Jean Carroll.)
Inside the courtroom, Mr. Trump broods, shaking his head and mouthing obscenities. Mr. Menendez has appeared more amiable, singing to himself during breaks in the proceeding and chuckling on Thursday as an F.B.I. agent testified that he had spent his birthday searching the senator's home.
"Trials are in reality not run the way they are on television," Sidney H. Stein, the bow-tie wearing judge who is overseeing Mr. Menendez's case, told potential jurors at the outset of the week.
To wit, some of the most engrossing action in the Menendez case has taken place 15 floors below the courtroom in a drab cafeteria where judges, defendants and reporters mingle over plastic clamshells of tuna salad.
Fred Daibes, one of the businessmen accused of bribing Mr. Menendez, was sitting there on Monday when a courtroom sketch artist sidled up to make a likeness. (Mr. Daibes, too, has pleaded not guilty.)
On Tuesday morning, Mr. Menendez huddled in the same spot with lawyers preparing to blame the senator's wife in opening arguments for all that gold. She was not in court; nor were Mr. Menendez's famous adult children, but he greeted the grill cook like an old friend.
Mr. Trump, who is more constrained by his Secret Service detail, has ordered in, including from McDonald's, a favorite.
It is hard to imagine all of it -- the bigness and the everyday, side by side -- playing out quite the same way in any other city, even Washington.
As E.B. White wrote in "Here is New York," his 1949 love letter to the vibrating city, "New York is peculiarly constructed to absorb almost anything that comes along (whether a thousand-foot liner out of the East or a twenty-thousand-man convention out of the West) without inflicting the event on its inhabitants."
So it was this week in Columbus Park, the small green space wedged between the courthouses. If you stood at the same corner on, say, Monday morning, you could watch Mr. Menendez arrive in a hired car within minutes of Mr. Trump's motorcade racing him down the same small stretch.
A passel of Trump supporters materialized just in time. A man draped a Trump flag over a metal police barrier. A woman pulled a bright red Make America Great Again hat out of a gift bag and put it on her head.
But the women practicing tai chi nearby did not lose their focus. Across the street, couples waiting with numbered tickets at the Marriage Bureau knew how special the day was -- but it had nothing to do with trials or charges or politicians. Same for the families at funeral homes on the opposite side of the park preparing to bury their dead.
As with so many things in New York, the greatest thrill seemed to belong to those visiting from out of town.
Fresh off an 18-hour flight from Singapore, an Australian couple walked through Columbus Park just as Mr. Trump arrived for the day, accidental tourists to legal history.
"The last few days we were wondering where Trump's trial was taking place," one of them, Halyna English, said. It turned out their hotel was a four-minute walk away. They were floored to find two major trials, not one.
"It is historic," she said. "Really, whatever affects people in America affects the rest of the world as well."
The couple briefly mused about trying to get into the senator's trial. They opted for coffee instead.

NEW YORK — At one corner of Baxter Street in lower Manhattan this week, former President Donald Trump transformed a shabby New York courthouse where he’s on trial into the backdrop for his comeback campaign. He vented to a lineup of cameras. The speaker of the House stopped by. Supporters waved purple and red Trump flags through a spring mist.
Things were far quieter just down the block, but still plenty noteworthy. There, at a different courthouse, another uncommonly high-powered defendant, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., shuffled silently through a metal detector each morning to face his own criminal trial.
The two men — one a Republican, one a Democrat — are longtime political adversaries with far different styles and stories. Their cases share little beyond tawdriness, with one centered on a hush-money payment to a porn actor and the other on alleged bribes paid in gold bars.
But in an extraordinary twist, the paths to their fates have physically crossed this past week, with the prosecution of a former president playing out all of 500 feet from where another jury of New Yorkers began hearing one of the gravest cases ever leveled against a sitting U.S. senator.
New York City is no stranger to blockbuster court dramas, many of them clustered like these in a dense neighborhood of courthouses and lockups once known as the Five Points. Alger Hiss’ perjury trial in 1949 helped set the tone for the Cold War. Prosecutors picked apart the mafia and then al-Qaida in courthouses here. There have been too many political corruption cases to count.
And yet, even by the standards of Manhattan — a tiny island where titans of business, prizewinning artists and heads of state jockey for restaurant booths and mingle at parties — the simultaneous trials have left judges, historians and court watchers alike grasping for anything close to a precedent.
“I can’t think of another time where you have had two major criminal trials, both involving political figures, vying for the front page like this,” said Robert Pigott, a lawyer and legal historian who leads walking tours of the court district.
“Usually, one is enough,” he added.
The trial of Trump, 77, is the bigger spectacle, attracting a who’s who of Republican politics, weekslong gavel-to-gavel live news coverage, and waves of rallies and counterprotests. On Thursday, a supporter released dozens of pink, phallus-shaped balloons bearing pictures of the judge and district attorney handling the case.
The stakes are significant, even if the charges — falsifying business records about the hush-money payment — sound dry. Trump, his party’s presumptive nominee, is hoping his case will be only a speed bump on his road back to the White House. But a conviction could eventually put him behind bars, even as he still faces three more criminal trials in Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C.
The charges against Menendez, 70, are weightier. Federal prosecutors asserted in court this past week that as a leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he “put his power up for sale,” helping Egypt and New Jersey businesspeople in exchange for lucrative bribes, like the gold and a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible. But while he is fighting for his legacy and freedom, even the senator’s closest allies agree that his political career is probably over.
In Washington, the two men were mostly partisan enemies. The senator twice voted to convict the former president on impeachment charges and once suggested that Trump was “compromised” by Russia. Menendez maintained Trump was “unfit” even after Trump commuted the sentence of Menendez’s friend and former co-defendant in an earlier corruption case.
But trying times make for odd bedfellows. In September, not long after the senator was charged with covertly helping a foreign power, Trump expressed something like sympathy. He said the senator, like him, had been subject to “an attack” by the Justice Department because he “wasn’t getting along too well” with the Biden administration.
Both have maintained their innocence.
Trump is on trial on the 15th floor of the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse at 100 Centre St., a state court near the meeting point of Chinatown, Little Italy and Tribeca. Menendez’s case is being heard on the 23rd floor of the nearby Daniel Patrick Moynihan Federal Courthouse. (Trump knows that building well: He lost a defamation case there earlier this year to writer E. Jean Carroll.)
Inside the courtroom, Trump broods, shaking his head and mouthing obscenities. Menendez has appeared more amiable, singing to himself during breaks in the proceeding and chuckling Thursday as an FBI agent testified that he had spent his birthday searching the senator’s home.
“Trials are in reality not run the way they are on television,” Sidney Stein, the bow-tie wearing judge who is overseeing Menendez’s case, told potential jurors at the outset of the week.
To wit, some of the most engrossing action in the Menendez case has taken place 15 floors below the courtroom in a drab cafeteria where judges, defendants and reporters mingle over plastic clamshells of tuna salad.
Fred Daibes, one of the businesspeople accused of bribing Menendez, was sitting there Monday when a courtroom sketch artist sidled up to make a likeness. (Daibes, too, has pleaded not guilty.)
On Tuesday morning, Menendez huddled in the same spot with lawyers preparing to blame the senator’s wife in opening arguments for all that gold. She was not in court; nor were Menendez’s famous adult children, but he greeted the grill cook like an old friend.
Trump, who is more constrained by his Secret Service detail, has ordered in, including from McDonald’s, a favorite.
It is hard to imagine all of it — the bigness and the everyday, side by side — playing out quite the same way in any other city, even Washington.
As E.B. White wrote in “Here is New York,” his 1949 love letter to the vibrating city, “New York is peculiarly constructed to absorb almost anything that comes along (whether a thousand-foot liner out of the East or a twenty-thousand-man convention out of the West) without inflicting the event on its inhabitants.”

Workers Reject Bid in Alabama For Auto Union: [National Desk]

Full text: The election, fiercely opposed by the state's political leaders, was seen as a test of the United Automobile Workers' ability to unionize factories in the South.
Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories near Tuscaloosa, Ala., voted on Friday against allowing the United Automobile Workers to represent them, a stunning blow to the union's campaign to gain ground in the South, where it has traditionally been weak.
The defeat came after Kay Ivey, Alabama's governor, and other Republican leaders argued that a pro-union vote would choke off the investment that has transformed the state into a major auto producer. The union's setback dims the chances that it will be able to quickly organize workers at Hyundai and Honda, which also have large factories in Alabama.
The vote had national significance as a test of whether the U.A.W. could build on a string of recent victories and make strides in a state whose elected officials have been hostile to organized labor. The union has said it wants to organize every automobile factory in the United States, expanding its membership to include the employees of companies like Toyota and Tesla.
But the loss at the Mercedes plants will almost surely slow down the union's campaign and probably force it to do more spadework to secure the support of workers before seeking to hold elections at other auto plants. Union leaders will want to spend time figuring out how best to counter the messages and tactics of local lawmakers and company executives.
"This loss stings," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at the storefront headquarters of the union's local branch down the road from the Mercedes factories in Vance and Woodstock, Ala.
But "most of us lost elections in our lives," he added. "We learn from it. We move forward, and that's what we intend to do."
Mercedes workers voted 56 percent to 44 percent against joining the union, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election. Close to 4,700 ballots were cast, representing a large majority of the 5,075 employees who were eligible to vote.
Auto executives and conservative lawmakers are likely to closely study the vote at Mercedes to figure out the best approaches to fend off the U.A.W. and other unions in future contests and to deter union campaigns from the get-go.
"The workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly!" Ms. Ivey said in a statement. "Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the sweet home to the U.A.W."
The South has become an important battleground. States like Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee are attracting much of the billions of dollars that automakers and suppliers are investing in electric vehicle and battery factories. The U.A.W. wants to represent workers at those factories.
Mercedes produces sport utility vehicles in Vance and battery packs for electric vehicles in Woodstock. Polling had been underway all week at the two factories.
"We thank all team members who asked questions, engaged in discussions and, ultimately, made their voices heard on this important issue," the company said in a statement on Friday.
In a campaign conducted largely by word of mouth, union activists argued that in addition to better pay and benefits, the U.A.W. would protect Mercedes workers from abrupt changes in their schedules and long shifts, including on weekends.
"If it wasn't for us building those cars, you wouldn't be putting the money that you're putting in your pockets," said Kay Finklea, who works in quality control at Mercedes and campaigned for the union. "So treat us with dignity, treat us with respect and pay us."
But activists acknowledged that many workers who were unhappy with working conditions at Mercedes were also reluctant to join the union, swayed by warnings from company executives and politicians that membership would lead to onerous dues and loss of control over their jobs.
Mercedes tried hard to block the union. Last month, in an apparent attempt to address employee complaints, the company shook up local management, appointing Federico Kochlowski as chief executive of the German company's U.S. unit.
Mr. Kochlowski, who has worked at Mercedes for about 20 years in various manufacturing positions in China, Mexico and the United States, acknowledged that there were problems at the Alabama plants and promised to make improvements.
"I understand that many things are not OK," he said in a video posted by Mercedes online. "Give me a shot."
Bart Moore, who works in material handling at Mercedes delivering parts to the assembly line, said he was hopeful that Mr. Kochlowski would follow through on his promises. "We'll see what he comes through with," Mr. Moore said. "You never know."
The U.A.W. has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
"This company, like most others, operated off the same playbook of fear, threats, intimidation," Mr. Fain said Friday.
Mercedes denies the claims.
Past attempts by the U.A.W. to represent workers at Mercedes and other automakers in the South had failed. But the U.A.W. is stronger than it has been in years after winning a unionization vote last month at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee where it previously lost two elections. The union also won hefty pay raises last year for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
Mercedes's campaign against the union "had way more effect than we anticipated," said Robert Lett, who works in the Woodstock battery factory and campaigned for the union. But he said the union would try again.
"It doesn't change our resolve," Mr. Lett said of the loss. "The fire is there for a change."

Turning Point As Auto Union Eyes Alabama: [National Desk]

Full text: Southern political leaders say a win for the United Automobile Workers would threaten their economies. Activists want to strike a blow against a system they say exploits the poor.
More than 5,000 Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama are voting this week on whether to join the United Automobile Workers union, a decision both supporters and opponents say will have consequences far beyond two factories near Tuscaloosa where the German carmaker churns out luxury sport utility vehicles and batteries for electric cars.
Conservative political leaders have portrayed the union campaign to organize Mercedes workers as an assault by outsiders on the region's economy and way of life. The vote tally is expected to be released by federal officials on Friday.
Six Southern governors, including Kay Ivey, an Alabama Republican, issued a statement last month criticizing unions as "special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by." Alabama recently passed a law intended to discourage union organizing.
For the union, a win would add to a string of victories in the South, where organized labor has traditionally been weak, and provide momentum to the U.A.W.'s efforts to win over workers at other nonunion automakers like Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Tesla.
If the U.A.W. loses, it could sharply slow down a campaign by the union's president, Shawn Fain, to organize auto and battery plants across the country. That effort began after the union last fall reached new contracts with hefty pay raises and other benefits for workers at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
In Alabama, which was a crucible of the civil rights movement, union organizers and supporters cast the Mercedes campaign as part of a decades-long struggle to dismantle an economic system based on exploitation of poor people.
"You are not just fighting for a union," Bishop William Barber II, an activist and professor at the Yale Divinity School, told a group of organizers, workers and supporters at a Montgomery church on Monday. "You are fighting for justice."
U.A.W. supporters were optimistic as workers cast their ballots at a Mercedes car factory in Vance, Ala., and at a company-owned factory in nearby Woodstock that assembles battery packs for electric vehicles. The National Labor Relations Board is overseeing the weeklong polling.
"I feel like we have the upper hand right now," said Sammie Ellis, a union organizer who installs wiring in Mercedes vehicles. He spoke outside a cluttered storefront office down the road from the factory in Vance where activists seated on folding chairs plotted strategy amid piles of placards with slogans like "Mercedes Workers United" and "End the Alabama Discount."
The Alabama discount is a reference to what union activists say is the state's main attraction to investors: low wages and compliant workers. "They come to take advantage of how Alabama workers are living in poorer conditions than workers in other parts of the country," said Joe Cleveland, an official with an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local in Anniston, Ala.
Mercedes said in a statement that the company "has a proven record of competitively compensating team members and providing many additional benefits."
Workers who have been at Mercedes for four years can earn $ 34 an hour, and some employees say they are grateful for the way the company has treated them.
"Mercedes has done a lot for me," Yolanda Berry, a team leader at the carmaker, said in a video posted on X by Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Mercedes and other foreign automakers with plants in the United States. Ms. Berry said she had earned less than $ 14 an hour at a previous job.
The U.A.W. is on a roll in the South after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted in April to be represented by the union. Also that month, the union won significant pay raises for Daimler Truck workers in North Carolina. A victory at Mercedes, which became a separate company from Daimler Truck in 2021, would bolster the union in its next campaign, organizing workers at a Hyundai factory in Montgomery, about 100 miles south of Tuscaloosa.
The South Korean company produces S.U.V.s at the Montgomery plant, including the Tucson and Santa Fe models. Union organizers are also targeting a Honda factory in Lincoln, Ala., where the Japanese company makes S.U.V.s and pickups. But that effort is in its early stages.
On Monday, about 50 activists and Hyundai workers gathered at Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery to sing union fight songs and hear from Bishop Barber.
Paraphrasing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Bishop Barber accused Southern political leaders of pitting races against each other. They fear Blacks "and poor whites uniting together and forming a voting bloc that does fundamentally reshape the economic architecture of the country and of the state," he said.
Opposition to the union from Alabama's Republican political leadership has been intense. After likening the U.A.W. to "leeches," Nathaniel Ledbetter, the Republican speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, helped push through a law that denies state funding to companies that voluntarily recognize unions.
The law will not directly affect the Mercedes vote, but it reflected the state of alarm among Republicans with close ties to business interests and their determination to stop union advances. Ms. Ivey signed the bill into law on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Ivey declined a request for an interview, referring to public statements she has made on the issue.
"Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy," Ms. Ivey said in a statement she issued with the governors of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, all Republicans.
Mr. Ledbetter's office did not respond to requests for comment.
A union drive at the Hyundai factory in Alabama in 2016 failed, but activists say things have changed. "The first time around, people were easily intimidated and scared by anti-union tactics," said Quichelle Liggins, who has worked at the Hyundai factory for 12 years. "This time, we're ready."
In an apparent effort to blunt the appeal of a union, Hyundai was one of several automakers that raised worker pay after the U.A.W. won gains for members at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis. The raises at Hyundai, announced in November, amounted to 14 percent over the previous year, according to the company.
But pay is not the only issue for many autoworkers in Alabama. Ms. Liggins, a single mother of two, said she hoped a union would protect people like her from long hours and unpredictable work schedules. "I had a manager tell me my job was more important than my family," she said.
In a statement, Hyundai said, "We are deeply committed to supporting quality jobs that pay competitive salaries and offer industry-leading benefits."
The company said that, with rare exceptions, it gave employees 30 days of notice about changes to their schedules. Employees are not required to work more than 10 hours a day, Hyundai said in a statement, and overtime is voluntary except during the introduction of a new model when repair and quality control teams may be required to work longer.
Mercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is used to dealing with unions in its home country, where by law half the members of the company's supervisory board represent employees. But in Alabama the company has opposed the union campaign. The U.A.W. has even accused the company of using illegal tactics.
The U.A.W. has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
Mercedes denies the claims. The company "has not interfered with or retaliated against any team member in their right to pursue union representation," it said in a statement, adding that it "firmly denies it has made any adverse employment decision based on union affiliation."
Mercedes has also raised pay in recent months and made an effort to give workers more notice about changes in their schedules, workers said. But Mr. Ellis, the activist, said the improvements had come only "because of the union knocking at the door."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are accused of taking part in a wide-ranging, international bribery scheme that lasted five years. Take a closer look at central figures related to the case.
Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are accused of taking part in a wide-ranging, international bribery scheme. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged them with accepting bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from several New Jersey businessmen in exchange for political favors.
The trial of Mr. Menendez and two of the businessmen, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, began on Monday. Ms. Menendez's trial was postponed for at least two months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She is preparing to undergo a mastectomy and may need radiation treatment, Mr. Menendez said. All four have pleaded not guilty.
Defendants
Senator Robert Menendez
New Jersey Senator
First elected to Congress in 1992, Mr. Menendez is now charged with taking bribes of gold, cash and a luxury car in exchange for trying to aid the governments of Egypt and Qatar, and seeking to disrupt separate criminal investigations involving his allies in New Jersey. After his arrest, he stepped down, as required, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but he has refused calls to resign and left open the possibility that he will run for re-election in November if he is exonerated at trial. This is his second federal bribery trial in seven years. In the earlier case, a jury was unable to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.
Fred Daibes
New Jersey Real Estate Developer
Mr. Daibes is accused of giving Mr. Menendez furniture, gold and cash. These were bribes, prosecutors say, for Mr. Menendez's efforts to have unrelated federal bank fraud charges Mr. Daibes faces in New Jersey quashed and for the senator's help in lining up financing for a stalled real estate project.
Wael Hana
Founder of the IS EG Halal company
Prosecutors say that Mr. Hana, a United States citizen born in Egypt, helped to arrange meetings with the senator and Egyptian officials that led to a lucrative monopoly for Mr. Hana's company, IS EG Halal. The company, which certifies that products shipped to Egypt are prepared according to Islamic law, was used to funnel bribes to the Menendezes in exchange for the senator's efforts to steer U.S. weapons and aid to Egypt, according to the indictment.
Nadine Menendez
Mr. Menendez's Wife
Ms. Menendez served as a go-between for Mr. Menendez, Egyptian intelligence officials and men who were seeking political favors from the senator, according to the indictment. Prosecutors say that bribes and messages went through Ms. Menendez to the senator.
The Co-Operator
Jose Uribe
Former New Jersey insurance broker
Mr. Uribe had been charged with seeking the senator's help to scuttle state insurance fraud investigations that involved Mr. Uribe's associates. He pleaded guilty in March and agreed to cooperate with the government, admitting in court that he had given a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz to Ms. Menendez to influence the senator.
The Court
Judge Sidney H. Stein
Presiding Judge
He was appointed by former President Bill Clinton to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1995. Among the more prominent defendants whose cases he has overseen are Jennifer Shah, a "Real Housewives" star sentenced to 78 months in prison in connection with a telemarketing fraud scheme, and Hassan Nemazee, a major donor to Democratic political causes, who was sentenced to 12 years in a bank fraud case.
Prosecution Team
Damian Williams
U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York
Mr. Williams joined the U.S. attorney's office in 2012 and was named by President Biden to the top post in 2021. He leads an office of 220 assistant U.S. attorneys and executives. He has overseen the prosecutions of defendants like Sam Bankman-Fried, convicted of stealing billions of dollars from his FTX cryptocurrency exchange, and Juan Orlando Hernández, the ex-Honduran president convicted in a cocaine importation case.
Christina Clark
Trial Attorney, Justice Department
She works in the department's national security division. Ms. Clark helped to prosecute the former high-ranking F.B.I. official Charles McGonigal, who pleaded guilty in a money-laundering case in connection with his work for a Russian oligarch under sanctions.
Catherine Ghosh
Assistant U.S. Attorney, Southern District, Public Corruption Unit
She helped prosecute 70 current and former employees of the New York City Housing Authority in what the authorities called the "largest single-day bribery takedown in the history of the Justice Department."
Eli Mark
Assistant U.S. Attorney, Public Corruption Unit
He helped to prosecute defendants in an N.C.A.A. basketball recruiting scandal, as well as a former State Supreme Court justice in an obstruction case.
Paul Monteleoni
Assistant U.S. Attorney, Public Corruption Unit
He helped to prosecute a former Brooklyn assistant district attorney in a bribery case and Robert Hadden, a former Columbia gynecologist who lured patients to his office and abused them.
Lara Pomerantz
Assistant U.S. Attorney, Public Corruption Unit
She helped to prosecute Ghislaine Maxwell, the former companion to Jeffrey Epstein, in a sex trafficking case and Norman Seabrook, the former longtime president of New York City's correction officers' union, in a bribery case.
Daniel Richenthal
Deputy Chief of the Southern District's Criminal Division
He helped to win the convictions of Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly, and Michael Avenatti, the once high-flying lawyer who tried to extort more than $ 20 million from the apparel giant Nike.
Defense Lawyers
Adam Fee
Lawyer for Robert Menendez
He previously spent five years as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District -- the same office prosecuting Mr. Menendez. Based in California, Mr. Fee focuses on white-collar criminal defense work.
Avi Weitzman
Lawyer for Mr. Menendez
He spent nearly seven years as a Southern District prosecutor and is now a New York City based partner at the same law firm as Mr. Fee, with an emphasis on complex civil and criminal cases.
Lawrence Lustberg
Lawyer for Wael Hana
A prominent New Jersey defense attorney, he was previously a federal public defender. He also represents Mr. Daibes in the pending bank fraud case in New Jersey.
César de Castro
Lawyer for Fred Daibes
Previously a prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office, he now runs his own New York City-based law firm. Last year, he represented Genaro García Luna, Mexico's former top security official who, after a high-profile federal trial in Brooklyn, was convicted of taking millions of dollars from the Sinaloa drug cartel.

Menendez Jurors See the Gold Bars At the Heart of His Bribery Case: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An F.B.I. agent, testifying for the government, described his search of Senator Robert Menendez's house in New Jersey.
With the corruption trial of Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey underway on Thursday, a prosecutor handed a juror in the first row of the jury box a plastic bag containing an object at the heart of the government's case: a gold bar that glinted under the courtroom lights.
One by one, jurors held the bag, turning it over in their hands and feeling its weight before passing it to their neighbor -- the jury's first tangible exposure to evidence prosecutors say was a bribe paid to Mr. Menendez, 70, and his wife.
The prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, soon handed jurors another bag containing several gold bars. But before she could hand over a third, the judge, Sidney H. Stein, said the jury "has gotten a feel for the weight of gold."
Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, and his wife, Nadine Menendez, have been charged with accepting gifts collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including gold, cash and a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible, in exchange for the senator's dispensing of political favors to the governments of Egypt and Qatar and to three New Jersey businessmen.
The senator and two of the businessmen -- Wael Hana and Fred Daibes -- are being tried together in Manhattan federal court. Ms. Menendez, 57, was to be tried with them, but her trial was postponed after her lawyers said she had a "serious medical condition."
On Thursday, the senator revealed that Ms. Menendez was being treated for breast cancer and was preparing to undergo a mastectomy and possible radiation treatment.
The third businessman charged in the case, Jose Uribe, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify as a prosecution witness at the trial.
The trial of Mr. Menendez, Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes is expected to last more than a month. In an opening statement on Wednesday, Avi Weitzman, a lawyer for the senator, largely pinned blame for the bribery charges on Ms. Menendez, who he said had hidden her past dire finances from her husband and "what she was asking others to give her."
On Thursday morning, lawyers for the senator's co-defendants, in their opening statements, portrayed their clients as friends of the couple whose innocent acts of generosity were being unfairly cast by prosecutors as criminal.
"It's about criminalizing friendships," said Mr. Hana's lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg. Mr. Daibes's lawyer, César de Castro, said his client had not given anything to the Menendezes to influence them or have the senator engage in any official act on anyone's behalf.
The presentation of the gold bars came as an F.B.I. special agent, Aristotelis Kougemitros, the government's first witness, testified about the gold and cash seized during a June 2022 search of the Menendezes' home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
Agent Kougemitros, who led the search team, said investigators seized $ 486,461 in cash, 11 one-ounce gold bars and two one-kilogram bars.
Although the agent's testimony focused on the valuable items found in the search, his account, along with F.B.I. photographs that were taken, offered jurors an uncommonly intimate visit to the Menendezes' home.
Photograph after photograph was displayed from inside the couple's bedroom, which had been locked and could only be opened with the help of an F.B.I. locksmith, the agent testified. Inside were photographs of the senator and his wife. There was an exercise machine by their bed; even their en suite bathroom was visible.
A photo of the contents of a closet showed aquamarine lingerie and playful ties, including two that depicted mice eating cheese.
Agent Kougemitros said that, with the locksmith's help, the team entered two bedroom closets, each secured with deadbolt locks, and found gold bars, jewelry and a safe. Inside the safe were boxes and envelopes of cash. In other parts of the house, agents found more cash: in clothing, a duffel bag, plastic bags and men's shoes. The Mercedes was parked in a cluttered garage.
During the initial phase of the search, Agent Kougemitros said, agents carefully laid out, counted and photographed the cash. Eventually, he said, the "sheer volume of bills" was too much to count by hand, "so we got cash-counting machines -- you've probably seen them in movies."
At one point, the agent stepped off the witness stand and opened a box to show the jury a bag stuffed with cash, which he said was found in the senator's office and contained $ 100,000.
Late Thursday, Adam Fee, a lawyer for the senator, raised questions during cross-examination about whether the senator even had access to the bedroom closet where the safe and gold had been found. He focused on the location of a blue blazer that the agent said had been hanging inside the closet and was linked to the senator.
Mr. Fee zoomed in on photographs that he said made it clear the blazer was hanging on an adjacent door outside of the closet.
"Do you want to change that testimony?" he asked the agent. He did not change his account.
The cross-examination was in line with the defense strategy of suggesting Ms. Menendez had secrets the senator was not privy to. On Wednesday, in Mr. Weitzman's opening statement, he hammered home that point, saying the senator did not have a key to the closet nor did he know gold was kept there.
"It is Nadine's closet," he said. "In fact, when you look inside the closet, you will see that it is filled with all of Nadine's clothing. Women's clothing."

UAW Effort to Organize Mercedes Workers in Alabama Has High Stakes

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — More than 5,000 Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama are voting this week on whether to join the United Automobile Workers union, a decision supporters and opponents say will have consequences far beyond two factories near Tuscaloosa where the German carmaker churns out luxury SUVs and batteries for electric cars.
Conservative political leaders have portrayed the union campaign to organize Mercedes workers as an assault by outsiders on the region’s economy and way of life. The vote tally is expected to be released by federal officials Friday.
Six Southern governors, including Kay Ivey, an Alabama Republican, issued a statement last month criticizing unions as “special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.” Alabama recently passed a law intended to discourage union organizing.
For the union, a win would add to a string of victories in the South, where organized labor has traditionally been weak, and provide momentum to the UAW’s efforts to win over workers at other nonunion automakers like Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Tesla.
If the UAW loses, it could slow down a campaign by the union’s president, Shawn Fain, to organize auto and battery plants across the country. That effort began after the union last fall reached new contracts with hefty pay raises and other benefits for workers at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
In Alabama, which was a crucible of the civil rights movement, union organizers and supporters cast the Mercedes campaign as part of a decadeslong struggle to dismantle an economic system based on exploitation of poor people.
“You are not just fighting for a union,” Bishop William Barber II, an activist and professor at the Yale Divinity School, told a group of organizers, workers and supporters at a Montgomery church Monday. “You are fighting for justice.”
UAW supporters were optimistic as workers cast their ballots at a Mercedes car factory in Vance, Alabama, and at a company-owned factory in nearby Woodstock that assembles battery packs for electric vehicles. The National Labor Relations Board is overseeing the weeklong polling.
“I feel like we have the upper hand right now,” said Sammie Ellis, a union organizer who installs wiring in Mercedes vehicles. He spoke outside a cluttered storefront office down the road from the factory in Vance where activists seated on folding chairs plotted strategy amid piles of placards with slogans like “Mercedes Workers United” and “End the Alabama Discount.”
The Alabama discount is a reference to what union activists say is the state’s main attraction to investors: low wages and compliant workers. “They come to take advantage of how Alabama workers are living in poorer conditions than workers in other parts of the country,” said Joe Cleveland, an official with an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local in Anniston, Alabama.
Mercedes said in a statement that the company “has a proven record of competitively compensating team members and providing many additional benefits.”
Workers who have been at Mercedes for four years can earn $34 an hour, and some employees say they are grateful for the way the company has treated them.
“Mercedes has done a lot for me,” Yolanda Berry, a team leader at the carmaker, said in a video posted on the social platform X by Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Mercedes and other foreign automakers with plants in the United States. Berry said she had earned less than $14 an hour at a previous job.
The UAW is on a roll in the South after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted in April to be represented by the union. Also that month, the union won significant pay raises for Daimler Truck workers in North Carolina. A victory at Mercedes, which became a separate company from Daimler Truck in 2021, would bolster the union in its next campaign, organizing workers at a Hyundai factory in Montgomery, about 100 miles south of Tuscaloosa.
The South Korean company produces SUVs at the Montgomery plant, including the Tucson and Santa Fe models. Union organizers are also targeting a Honda factory in Lincoln, Alabama, where the Japanese company makes SUVs and pickups. But that effort is in its early stages.
On Monday, about 50 activists and Hyundai workers gathered at Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery to sing union fight songs and hear from Barber.
Paraphrasing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Barber accused Southern political leaders of pitting races against each other. They fear Blacks “and poor whites uniting together and forming a voting bloc that does fundamentally reshape the economic architecture of the country and of the state,” he said.
Opposition to the union from Alabama’s Republican political leadership has been intense. After likening the UAW to “leeches,” Nathaniel Ledbetter, the Republican speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, helped push through a law that denies state funding to companies that voluntarily recognize unions.
The law will not directly affect the Mercedes vote, but it reflected the state of alarm among Republicans with close ties to business interests and their determination to stop union advances. Ivey signed the bill into law Monday.
A spokesperson for Ivey declined a request for an interview, referring to public statements she has made on the issue.
“Unionization would certainly put our states’ jobs in jeopardy,” Ivey said in a statement she issued with the governors of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, all Republicans.
Ledbetter’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
A union drive at the Hyundai factory in Alabama in 2016 failed, but activists say things have changed. “The first time around, people were easily intimidated and scared by anti-union tactics,” said Quichelle Liggins, who has worked at the Hyundai factory for 12 years. “This time, we’re ready.”
In an apparent effort to blunt the appeal of a union, Hyundai was one of several automakers that raised worker pay after the UAW won gains for members at Ford, GM and Stellantis. The raises at Hyundai, announced in November, amounted to 14% over the previous year, according to the company.
But pay is not the only issue for many autoworkers in Alabama. Liggins, a single mother of two, said she hoped a union would protect people like her from long hours and unpredictable work schedules. “I had a manager tell me my job was more important than my family,” she said.
In a statement, Hyundai said, “We are deeply committed to supporting quality jobs that pay competitive salaries and offer industry-leading benefits.”
The company said that, with rare exceptions, it gives employees 30 days’ notice about changes to their schedules. Employees are not required to work more than 10 hours a day, Hyundai said in a statement, and overtime is voluntary except during the introduction of a new model, when repair and quality control teams may be required to work longer.
Mercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is used to dealing with unions in its home country, where by law, half the members of the company’s supervisory board represent employees. But in Alabama, the company has opposed the union campaign. The UAW has even accused the company of using illegal tactics.
The UAW has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
Mercedes denies the claims. The company “has not interfered with or retaliated against any team member in their right to pursue union representation,” it said in a statement, adding that it “firmly denies it has made any adverse employment decision based on union affiliation.”
Mercedes has also raised pay in recent months and made an effort to give workers more notice about changes in their schedules, workers said. But Ellis, the activist, said the improvements had come only “because of the union knocking at the door.”

Full text: Tracey Tully's reporting domain is New Jersey. But for the next six weeks, she'll journey across the Hudson River to report on the federal corruption trial of Senator Robert Menendez.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Former President Donald J. Trump's trial is not the only case The New York Times is covering in Lower Manhattan this week.
Less than a quarter-mile from Manhattan criminal court, where Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey is being tried on a web of federal corruption charges. Prosecutors say Mr. Menendez steered weapons and government aid to Egypt, propped up a friend's halal meat business and meddled in criminal investigations that targeted his allies. The government has accused Mr. Menendez and his wife of accepting bribes for these favors in the form of cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz.
Tracey Tully was one of five Times reporters in Federal District Court on Monday for the first day of jury selection in the trial. Ms. Tully, who covers all things New Jersey, joined The Times in 2017 after stints at The New York Daily News and The Albany Times Union. Three years into her role editing news about the New York region, she switched to reporting, which was a full-circle moment: Ms. Tully began her journalism career more than 30 years ago as a reporter in Hudson County, N.J., where Mr. Menendez grew up and where he rose as a political figure.
In an interview conducted after Monday's proceedings, Ms. Tully spoke to Times Insider -- from a hallway in the courthouse -- about the case against Mr. Menendez, and its reverberations in New Jersey. This conversation has been edited.
This is not the first time Menendez has faced corruption charges, right?
Seven years ago, in 2017, he was on trial related to allegations of accepting bribes from a doctor, who was a close friend of his. That ended in a hung jury, resulting in a mistrial. The scope of the allegations in 2017 was more limited than what he is facing in this trial.
Your reporting has described Menendez as a powerful person in the Democratic Party in New Jersey. How have the charges resonated there?
The charges were a statewide political cataclysm. During the first trial, in 2017, people really stood with him, or at least they withheld their criticism. This time around he was almost immediately abandoned by most Democratic leaders in New Jersey. The day of the indictment, Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said Menendez should resign. There was a cascade of fellow Democrats calling for his resignation. It took a few days, but finally, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a longtime friend of Menendez and a very close political ally, called for his resignation. That was remarkable because Booker testified as a character witness during Menendez's first trial.
What the senator has said is, Please, let me have my day in court -- I deserve an opportunity to be innocent until proven guilty. He has refused calls to resign.
And his current Senate term ends this year, right?
People smelled blood in the water, and it was a frenzy for his Senate seat among fellow Democrats and Republican hopefuls. The first lady of New Jersey, Tammy Murphy, began running as a Democrat for the seat. That set up a clash with Andy Kim, a congressman from South Jersey. There was a lawsuit over the design of election ballots, which are incredibly important to the political party structure in New Jersey. The federal indictment against Menendez fueled all of this. There's been a domino effect.
Seven years ago, you joined The Times as an editor. What made you want to go back to being a reporter?
I missed it. I just got the itch again. Being an editor was great for 20 years. I worked part time while I raised three kids. It suited my schedule. Nick Corasaniti, who covered New Jersey for The Times, went to the Politics desk to cover the 2020 election. There was an opening, and I had the audacity to ask, Can I do this again?
You're normally responsible for covering news across an entire state. How does it feel to be assigned to one courthouse to cover a trial that could last more than six weeks?
I'm a regional reporter and a generalist; anything that happens in New Jersey, I get to cover it. Which is a blessing and a curse. This will be narrowly focused. I'm going to be traveling from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan every day court is in session. So that's different. But the assignment is also no different from what journalists do all the time. You dive into whatever the story of the moment is, and you cover that.

Gold Bars, Cars and Cash: A Broad Web of Charges: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey is accused of participating in an international bribery scheme involving gold bars, cash and a Mercedes-Benz.
Jury selection for Senator Robert Menendez's corruption trial started on Monday in a federal courthouse in Manhattan, a 20-mile drive from Mr. Menendez's home in northern New Jersey, where for decades he has been a well-known Democratic political leader.
His efforts to move the trial to his home turf failed. Jurors picked to decide the case will be from Manhattan, the Bronx or one of several New York counties north of the city.
Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York have said that they expect to take as many as six weeks to present their case against Mr. Menendez, who is accused of being at the center of an international bribery scheme involving more than $ 100,000 in gold bullion, an Egyptian halal meat monopoly and a Qatari sheikh.
Mr. Menendez, 70, will be tried with two New Jersey businessmen, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana.
All three sat in the court for more than two hours Monday morning, quietly talking with their lawyers while the judge, Sidney H. Stein, questioned prospective jurors who said they would be unable to serve for the duration of the trial.
The senator appeared relaxed, his hands clasped either at his waist or near his chest, fingers tented.
His wife, Nadine Menendez, 57, was also charged in the bribery scheme but will be tried separately, in July. A judge granted her request for a delay after her lawyers said she had a serious medical condition that required prompt treatment and, possibly, a lengthy recovery.
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty, and Mr. Menendez has said he will be exonerated at trial, leaving open the possibility that he might run for re-election as an independent in November.
His lawyers have indicated that his defense, at least in part, will be to blame Ms. Menendez, his wife of less than four years. If he chooses to testify, Mr. Menendez would be most likely to outline "the ways in which she withheld information" and "led him to believe that nothing unlawful was taking place," his lawyers said in court papers.
A key government witness in the trial could be Jose Uribe, another businessman who was charged with Mr. Menendez but who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors. At his guilty plea in March, Mr. Uribe admitted that he gave Ms. Menendez a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible "in return for influencing a United States senator to stop a criminal investigation."
The case has proceeded relatively quickly to trial ever since the senator and his wife were first charged in September 2023 with conspiring to trade Mr. Menendez's "influence and power" for an array of bribes, including the luxury car, home mortgage payments, gold bullion and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.
Here are the central claims outlined by prosecutors, who will be trying to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Menendez, Mr. Daibes and Mr. Hana participated in a sprawling bribery conspiracy that lasted nearly five years:
Aiding Egypt
Mr. Menendez is charged with using his "influence and power" as a senator in ways that benefited both the government of Egypt and Mr. Hana, an American citizen who emigrated from Egypt and was trying to get a halal meat certification company off the ground in New Jersey.
For example, after meeting with Mr. Hana in May 2018, prosecutors say, Mr. Menendez obtained nonpublic information from the State Department about the number and nationality of employees at the U.S. embassy in Cairo. The information was relayed to an Egyptian official through Ms. Menendez and Mr. Hana. Prosecutors noted that the information was not classified but was considered highly sensitive and could pose "significant operational security concerns" if disclosed.
Mr. Menendez, a former leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is also accused of steering weapons and aid to Egypt in exchange for bribes. In May 2018, he secretly helped to write and edit a letter from Egyptian officials who were lobbying other U.S. senators to release $ 300 million in additional aid, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors also described an effort by Mr. Hana to enlist Mr. Menendez's help in smoothing over a U.S.-Egyptian dispute during this period. After an American tourist was seriously injured in a mistaken 2015 Egyptian military attack, some members of Congress balked at awarding certain military aid to Egypt, according to the indictment.
In May 2019, prosecutors said an Egyptian official sent a message to Mr. Hana, in Arabic, saying that if Mr. Menendez helped to resolve the matter, "he will sit very comfortably."
"Orders, consider it done," Mr. Hana replied, according to the indictment.
A year later, after a meeting with an Egyptian general, Mr. Menendez also urged the State Department to take a more active role in a dispute over a hydroelectric dam Ethiopia was building on the Nile River, prosecutors said. Egypt was opposed to the dam and feared it would cut into the country's water supply.
Halal meat monopoly
To help Mr. Hana's business, IS EG Halal, Mr. Menendez pressured a high-level Department of Agriculture official, prosecutors claim. The official had objected to Egypt's plan to make Mr. Hana's company the sole entity authorized to certify that meat imported to the country from the United States had been prepared according to Islamic law. (Until then, at least four U.S. companies had divided the work, and the sudden shift caused prices to skyrocket.)
According to the indictment, Mr. Menendez called the official to demand that the U.S.D.A. "stop interfering with IS EG Halal's monopoly."
The official refused, but the business arrangement, which the United States had no power to block, remained in place, enabling IS EG Halal to thrive. The company became a conduit for "the bribes being paid" to Mr. Menendez through his wife, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors have said that all of this justified a highly unusual criminal charge: that Mr. Menendez acted as a foreign agent, and that his wife and their co-defendants conspired to put him into that role.
'Kill and stop all investigation'
Mr. Menendez is also charged with trying to use his clout to quash criminal cases in New Jersey -- two involving associates of Mr. Uribe and one against Mr. Daibes, a real estate developer and longtime friend of the senator who had donated to his campaigns.
Mr. Uribe had been implicated in an insurance fraud investigation by the New Jersey attorney general's office that involved two of his associates, according to the indictment. "The deal is to kill and stop all investigation," Mr. Uribe wrote to Mr. Hana in April 2018.
Mr. Menendez called and then met in September 2019 with officials from the attorney general's office in an effort to scuttle the inquiry, according to the indictment. In exchange, Mr. Uribe told a judge at his recent guilty plea, he had provided the Mercedes-Benz to Ms. Menendez in April 2019 and arranged to cover its monthly payments.
Mr. Uribe also admitted in court that he and Ms. Menendez attempted to cover up the scheme by trying to make it appear that the car payments were loans, not bribes. A few days after Mr. Uribe's guilty plea, Ms. Menendez and the senator were additionally charged with obstruction of justice.
Seeking a new U.S. attorney
Mr. Daibes is accused of giving Mr. Menendez and his wife bribes of furniture, gold bars and cash.
Investigators found 11 gold bars linked to Mr. Daibes during a June 16, 2022, search of the couple's home. Mr. Daibes's fingerprints or DNA were also found on 10 envelopes, containing more than $ 80,000, during the search, according to a court filing.
Less than three months before the search, Ms. Menendez sold two one-kilogram bars of gold that were traced to Mr. Daibes and worth about $ 120,000, prosecutors have also said.
The payments were provided, in part, in exchange for the senator's efforts to resolve federal bank fraud charges that Mr. Daibes faces in New Jersey, according to the indictment.
Mr. Daibes was charged in October 2018 with obtaining loans under false pretenses from a bank he had founded years earlier, Mariner's.
Prosecutors have said that Mr. Menendez tried to have a U.S. attorney for New Jersey installed who might be willing to go easy on Mr. Daibes. That effort failed, but Mr. Menendez twice called the federal prosecutor responsible for overseeing Mr. Daibes's case, according to the indictment.
Mr. Daibes eventually pleaded guilty to one of the 2018 indictment's 14 felony counts in an agreement that required no prison time.
Last year, however, after Mr. Daibes was charged in the senator's corruption case, a federal judge in New Jersey rejected the plea, which he then withdrew. The bank fraud charges are still pending.
Qatar connection
All of this was occurring as Mr. Daibes was preparing to build a high-rise apartment complex along the Hudson River in Edgewater, N.J.
A Chinese company that had been bankrolling the project had pulled out because of delays tied to an environmental cleanup of the parcel, a Superfund site. Interest rates among conventional lenders were climbing, and Mr. Daibes was now accused of bank fraud.
It was Mr. Menendez who helped craft a solution by introducing Mr. Daibes in June 2021 to an investor who was a member of the Qatari royal family, according to the indictment.
Then, as Mr. Daibes was negotiating with the would-be investor, Mr. Menendez issued at least one statement, on Aug. 20, 2021, supportive of Qatar, prosecutors said. (A news release the senator issued that day praised "friends and allies in Qatar" as "moral exemplars" for accepting Afghan refugees.)
Mr. Menendez's comments came at a time when the oil-rich Gulf state was working to repair its image before hosting the 2022 World Cup.
In January 2023, Heritage Advisors, a firm founded by a Qatari sheikh, finalized a $ 45 million shared ownership agreement for the Edgewater project with a company controlled by Mr. Daibes, New Jersey property records show.
Mr. Daibes gave Mr. Menendez "at least one gold bar" after a draft of the real estate deal was firmed up, prosecutors said.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have said the allegations related to Qatar are baseless.
In a legal filing, they have argued that prosecutors ignored statements by the investment company's chief operating officer that indicated the partnership had nothing to do with the senator's support.
An official with the Qatari investment firm told prosecutors in December 2023 that the company considered the high-rise complex a "trophy project" because it faced the Manhattan skyline. The investors also said that they were able to negotiate favorable terms because Mr. Daibes was "unbankable," leaving him few lending options, according to a filing last month by Avi Weitzman, one of Mr. Menendez's lawyers.
"The decision to invest in the Edgewater development project," Mr. Weitzman wrote, "had nothing to do with Senator Menendez or the government of Qatar."

No Jurors Are Seated on the First Day of Menendez's Corruption Trial: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez is charged with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars in exchange for political favors at home and abroad.
Jury selection began on Monday in the federal corruption trial of Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, who is charged with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars in exchange for political favors at home and abroad.
By the end of the day, no jurors had been selected for the trial, which is taking place in Manhattan and is likely to last until about the Fourth of July.
Mr. Menendez has represented New Jersey in Congress for three decades, but the corruption case was brought by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. The jurors who will be asked to weigh the evidence against him and two New Jersey businessmen, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, will be from Manhattan, the Bronx or several counties north of New York City.
All three men have pleaded not guilty.
At 7:30 a.m., reporters and prospective jurors carrying blue summons envelopes lined up outside the Daniel Patrick Moynihan federal courthouse waiting for the doors to open to the public.
Inside the courthouse, just before 8:30 a.m., Mr. Menendez walked through security, wearing a dark blue suit and striped red tie, his Senate pin visible on his lapel. He greeted court officers with a smile as he passed through the metal detector.
Two hours later, he stood facing scores of prospective jurors as they filed into a wood-paneled courtroom. He appeared relaxed as the proceeding continued, leaning back in a chair with hands clasped either at his waist or near his chest.
Mr. Menendez, 70, and the two businessmen sat quietly talking with their lawyers while the judge, Sidney H. Stein, spent most of the day, off the bench, questioning prospective jurors who had said that they would be unable to serve for the duration of the trial; roughly three dozen would-be jurors were dismissed after an initial screening by the judge, and an additional 50 people were called into the room.
The questioning is likely to continue on Tuesday, perhaps pushing the lawyers' opening statements to Wednesday.
Mr. Menendez has said that he expects to be exonerated and has left open the possibility of running for re-election in November.
"I appreciate the jury's sacrifice, their time and commitment," Mr. Menendez said after leaving the courtroom for the day.
He and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were charged in a September 2023 indictment with being at the center of a bribery scheme that lasted for nearly five years.
Mr. Menendez, the former chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is accused of steering government aid and weapons to Egypt, helping Mr. Hana's company win a lucrative monopoly and meddling in criminal investigations in New Jersey on behalf of his allies.
In return, prosecutors have said, the senator and his wife accepted a Mercedes-Benz convertible, home mortgage payments, a low- or no-show job for Ms. Menendez, cash and gold bars. Investigators who searched their home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in June 2022 discovered much of the cash stashed in coat pockets, boots and a safe.
Ms. Menendez, 57, will be tried separately, in July. Her lawyers have said that she was recently diagnosed with a serious medical condition that will require surgery and, possibly, follow-up treatment and a lengthy period of recovery. She did not attend the first day of jury selection.
The jurors, seated eight to a row, wore a sea of colors and patterns -- oranges and greens, plaids and stripes -- that contrasted sharply with the staid blue and black suits of the defendants and their lawyers.
Judge Stein began by thanking them for their service, acknowledging the strain that a lengthy trial, in the middle of the summer, might cause. He cited John Adams, the second president of the United States who helped write the Declaration of Independence and also worked as a lawyer.
"John Adams wrote that representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty," Judge Stein told the potential jurors. "I firmly believe that, and if you are chosen to serve as a juror on this trial, you will be part of that more than 250-year tradition."
The trial is expected to last six or seven weeks, but could run longer.
"Trials in reality are not run the way they are on television," Judge Stein said. "Things cannot be foreseen exactly."
A jury consultant, Justin Kelly, sat at the defense table with Mr. Menendez's legal team. His firm, DOAR, was paid $ 150,000 for legal services in March by Mr. Menendez's Senate campaign account, federal spending reports show.
This is the second time in seven years that Mr. Menendez has been on trial after being charged with public corruption.
The first trial, in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, ended with a hung jury in November 2017. A judge then dismissed several of the charges, and prosecutors later dismissed the rest of the charges in January 2018.

A Candidate's Immigrant Success Story Omits a Few Things: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bernie Moreno, the Republican challenging Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio, tells a riches-to-rags-to-riches tale. But the reality isn't so tidy.
He is running for the Senate as an immigrant who made good, reaching out to Ohio voters with a stirring, only-in-America bootstraps story: arriving as a child from Colombia, taking a risk on a struggling business, and then turning it into a smashing success and himself into a millionaire 100 times over.
Running under the banner of Donald J. Trump's populist political movement, Bernie Moreno, the Republican challenging Senator Sherrod Brown, humbly calls himself a "car guy from Cleveland" and recounts the modest circumstances of his childhood, when his immigrant family started over from scratch in the United States.
"We came here with absolutely nothing -- we came here legally -- but we came here, nine of us in a two-bedroom apartment," Mr. Moreno said in 2023, in what became his signature pitch. His father "had to leave everything behind," he has said, remembering what he called his family's "lower-middle-class status."
But there is much more that Mr. Moreno does not say about his background, his upbringing and his very powerful present-day ties in the country where he was born.
Mr. Moreno was born into a rich and politically connected family in Bogotá, a city that it never completely left behind, where some members continue to enjoy great wealth and status.
While his parents left Colombia in 1971 to start over in the United States, where Mr. Moreno fully transplanted, some of his siblings eventually returned. One of his brothers served as Bogotá's ambassador to the United States. Another founded a development and construction empire that stretches across the Andes from the Colombian interior to its Caribbean shores.
Political candidates seeking office for the first time necessarily engage in a calculated process of self-creation, carefully sifting through their past and deciding what to emphasize, what to minimize, what to be ready to explain and, in many cases, what they hope no one will find out. Needless to say, it helps to give voters as much as possible to find relatable and as little as possible to find alienating or hard to understand.
For Mr. Moreno, the way he has framed his biography -- and the material that he has omitted from the frame -- reflects a keen awareness of the political reality in the Trump-era Republican Party, in Ohio, and in a contest with the rumpled Mr. Brown, a Democrat (and a doctor's Yale-educated son) who has survived in an increasingly red state by holding himself out as a champion of the working class.
In an Ohio hit hard by economic globalization and the decline of heavy manufacturing, a candidate from the South American elite might feel like a stretch. Instead, Mr. Moreno describes how he bet his life savings in 2005 on a small, underperforming Mercedes-Benz dealership on Cleveland's West Side, turning what could be a liability in courting the working class -- fabulous wealth, with assets valued up to $ 105.7 million and yearly income nearing $ 6 million -- into proof of his own hard work and entrepreneurial street smarts.
As such political autobiographies go, it is powerful in a state where Republican successes of late have come from the drift of former steel towns in Northeast Ohio, the coal belt of Appalachia and heavy industries of Northern Ohio toward Mr. Trump. For the broader G.O.P., his journey also bolsters the party's appeal to Latino voters and to first-generation immigrants striving for a better life.
But the Morenos' story is not a typical American immigrant's tale.
Roberto Moreno, one of the candidate's brothers, is president and chief executive of Amarilo Holdings, a major development and construction conglomerate in Bogotá.
Another brother, Luis Alberto Moreno, after serving as Colombia's ambassador to the United States, was elected president of the Inter-American Development Bank with the backing of George W. Bush's administration. His wide circle of friends speaks to a bipartisan, internationalist bent that shares little in common with the Trumpist worldview: It includes the music impresario Quincy Jones, the actress Salma Hayek, Bill and Hillary Clinton, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate majority leader.
The Morenos' immigration narrative is also atypical in that they were not strangers to the country when they arrived: The candidate's father, Bernardo Moreno Sr., had studied gastroenterology, earned a master's degree in surgery and had done his medical residency all at the University of Pennsylvania, where Bernie Moreno's eldest three siblings were born. His mother, Marta Moreno, had earned a degree from Stanford.
In Colombia, Dr. Moreno had been the country's equivalent of the secretary of health, and he and his wife enjoyed what Bernie Moreno described as considerable generational wealth on both sides: multiple properties, farms, servants, staff and a house in Bogotá so prominent that it was later converted to the German ambassador's residence.
Roberto Moreno said their father was a physician for the Colombian president, Misael Pastrana Borrero, from 1970 to 1974. He was also the doctor to Dorita Salive, wife of the industrialist Rómulo Lara Borrero, which fostered a relationship between the rich and powerful Lara family and the Morenos.
The Morenos weren't the richest family in Colombia, but they were among the best connected. And their story of emigrating to the United States is familiar to the South American elite.
"Colombian millionaires don't leave Colombia to live the American dream or to prevent their children from growing up with privileges," said Federico Gómez Lara, editor in chief of Cambio Colombia, a magazine of current affairs and politics, and a grandson of Dorita Salive. "They leave Colombia because they have enough money to throw away. Colombia seems like a village to them, and they want their children to be educated and mingle with the real rich."
In a friendly interview in Colombia earlier this year with the journalist Patricia Lara Salive, Mr. Gomez's mother and the heiress to one of the nation's largest fortunes, Bernie Moreno's brother Roberto said that his parents had intended to stay in Florida only briefly while the children learned English, but Dr. Moreno's rapid ascent at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, coupled with their daughter's marriage to an American, changed their plans.
"I want my children to learn English and get to know another culture," Roberto Moreno quoted his mother as saying. "Let's go to Florida for a while."
"A while was supposed to be one or two years," added Roberto Moreno, who studied engineering at the University of Florida. But their father joined them after four months and took the medical board exams to practice medicine in Florida. "And so we stayed there."
Mr. Moreno, as a candidate for office, speaks often of the cramped, two-bedroom apartment in Florida where his parents and their seven children first took up residence. That first home, purchased in 1971 with a mortgage worth more than $ 300,000 in today's dollars, was a three-bedroom condominium in a new, 15-story high-rise on the ocean in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.
Moreno campaign aides say he did not intend to leave the impression that he climbed from abject poverty, or that his family's struggles were protracted. But, they said, the Morenos did face lean times. His campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview.
Marta Moreno, a businesswoman, preceded her husband to the United States by several months, helping him secure an H1 visa, for highly skilled immigrants, in 1972. (Mr. Moreno's campaign declined to say what visa Mrs. Moreno held before her husband joined her.) Her name was on the deed to the condominium, along with those of her mother, Tila de Obando, and her stepfather, Jorge Obando.
The building was advertised as having "300 feet of your own private beach," a "wide deck for sunning," a pool, a putting green and a sauna.
Within two months, Bernie Moreno's step-grandfather had lent the family the money to move to a four-bedroom house in Pompano Beach with a pool on a canal, ocean access and a two-car garage.
Dr. Moreno got his medical license in late 1973 and was hired as a surgeon on Nov. 8 of that year. His daughter was engaged to an American in 1976.
"At first, our parents weren't on the same page, as our father wanted to stay in Colombia," explained Vicky Stockamore, Bernie Moreno's older sister. "So while he was hopeful it would be a temporary move, our mother was committed that she wanted to raise her family here."
Setting the memories of a 5-year-old aside, they said, the two-bedroom apartment of Mr. Moreno's recollections had a third bedroom only in the generous parlance of a real-estate brochure. A floor plan showed an open room separated from the living room by an accordion door. Even the four-bedroom house was no lap of luxury for a family of nine.
The job of surgical assistant that Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., offered almost apologetically to Dr. Moreno as he studied for his Florida physician's license paid $ 10,920 a year, or $ 80,440 today. That may not be poverty wages, but it is not a lot on which to raise seven children.
"He was making $ 5 an hour as a surgical assistant," Mr. Moreno has told voters, accurately. "My mom would have us at the flea market, selling Colombian trinkets on Saturdays."
Their mother believed in hard work, Roberto Moreno said. When he and his two older siblings wanted to buy a boat to water-ski, their mother made them save up for part of it. He bagged groceries, another brother delivered newspapers and sold vacuum cleaners, and their sister worked at a bank.
But by October 1973, Dr. Moreno, the candidate's father, had re-established himself with full privileges as a South Florida surgeon. He was president of the medical staff at Holy Cross Hospital when Mr. Moreno was a teenager, chief of surgery by 1989 and a member of the board of governors of the American College of Surgeons. Marta Moreno quickly became a successful real estate agent.
"When we first arrived, it took a lot of hard work for our family to establish ourselves," Ms. Stockamore said. "I couldn't be more proud of how my mother and father both restarted their lives."
In past interviews, Mr. Moreno has captured the contradictions of his childhood. In a podcast before his political career took off, he alluded to just how wealthy his family had been in Colombia and why his mother decided to give up that privilege.
"We were being raised in an entitled way, and she didn't want us to be raised that way," he said in the podcast. "So she packed up 23 suitcases, seven kids, and flew to Fort Lauderdale."

Ticket Splitting in Battlegrounds Gives Democrats Hope for Senate: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than 7,000 U.A.W. workers at Daimler Truck plants in North Carolina are set to strike at midnight in a labor action that could carry political consequences.
Barring a last-minute breakthrough, more than 7,000 workers are set to walk off their truck and bus assembly lines on Friday night in the swing state of North Carolina, injecting the United Automobile Workers' new activism in the South directly into the 2024 election.
North Carolina has never been hospitable to organized labor, and the midnight strike at the North American subsidiary of the German industrial giant Daimler Truck has been greeted with trepidation by the state's Democratic establishment, which has long tried to project a moderate, pro-business bent.
But Shawn Fain, the U.A.W.'s brash new president, doesn't much care.
"We don't expect politicians to save the day, but at the end of the day, politicians have an obligation to the people that elect them," he said in an interview on Thursday, adding: "It's our generation-defining moment. This is a time where politicians need to pick a side."
In September, President Biden joined the picket line of the U.A.W.'s successful strike of the Big Three U.S. automakers, and Thursday, a White House spokeswoman, Robyn Patterson, indicated that the president could be equally aggressive if there was a Daimler walkout.
"President Biden strongly believes that those benefiting from our strong support for manufacturing made in American should work in good faith to do everything possible to ensure jobs -- including those in North Carolina -- remain well-paid, middle-class jobs, and that all workers have a fair and free choice to join a union if they choose," she said.
Democratic leaders in North Carolina, including Gov. Roy Cooper, were far more equivocal -- and deferential -- to Daimler Truck, a major employer in the state.
"North Carolina workers are the best and most productive in the world and need to be paid fairly," Mr. Cooper said in a statement on Thursday. "We're proud that Daimler Trucks and its amazing U.A.W. workers are building the future of electric school bus travel right here in North Carolina, and I will continue to monitor the contract negotiations and urge a swift resolution."
Josh Stein, the Democratic attorney general who is running to replace Governor Cooper, who is term-limited, was similarly careful in a statement.
"North Carolina workers deliver the best products in the world, and they deserve to be valued," he said. "I've been in touch with both parties to encourage them to continue to work toward an agreement that supports workers and enables the company to continue to succeed."
Making matters more delicate, one of the central grievances of the union is the electric vehicle transition pressed by Mr. Biden, in part through the $ 5 billion Clean School Bus Program, which has channeled $ 14 million worth of federal funds directly to Daimler's Thomas Built bus division in High Point, N.C., and millions more through school districts buying Thomas Built electric buses. The union says the workers at the High Point plant are among the lowest paid in the company.
"Our taxpayer dollars aren't being injected into these companies to assist with an E.V. transition just for a few people on top to get rich and leave everybody else behind," Mr. Fain said. "There have to be better standards."
To the U.A.W., a successful strike in the state with the second-lowest percentage of union workers in the country is vital. The six-week work stoppage at the three largest U.S. automakers last fall secured the largest pay raises in decades.
That helped propel U.A.W. organizers into the nonunionized South, where workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted overwhelmingly last week to join the union, a breakthrough that created a beachhead for union organizers. Daimler Truck North America is unionized, but U.A.W. officials want to win record wage gains at Daimler's plants in Mount Holly, Cleveland, High Point and Gastonia, N.C., and parts distribution centers in Atlanta and Memphis ahead of an organizing vote next month at Mercedes-Benz in Alabama.
"Our fight at Daimler is intimately connected with something else happening in the South," Mr. Fain told members in a broadcast from Detroit on Tuesday night. "Autoworkers at nonunion auto companies have launched a national movement to unionize."
But Tennessee and Alabama are not in play in 2024. North Carolina is, and Democratic politicians there appear to be reticent hosts.
Mr. Cooper and Mr. Stein have positioned themselves as centrists whose success has revolved around improving education and job training, and diversifying the economy in North Carolina, said Ferrel Guillory, a professor at the University of North Carolina.
"There's no particular upside, politically speaking, for center and center-left Democrats to come across in the same way that a Gretchen Whitmer would," he said, referring to the governor of heavily unionized Michigan. "Cooper and Stein aren't anti-union, but they're not northern politicians either."
In contrast, Mr. Biden has proclaimed himself the "most pro-union president in history" as he has collected union endorsements, the most recent coming on Wednesday from the North America's Building Trades Unions. If Mr. Biden steps in aggressively, he could find himself clashing with North Carolina's top Democrats when the state's highest offices are on the line.
A year ago, the Biden administration appeared to use the leverage provided by federal electric school bus subsidies to help the United Steelworkers unionize Blue Bird, a school bus company in Fort Valley, Ga. Two weeks before the union vote, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, demanded that recipients of federal subsidies detail the benefits they were offering their workers, and required the companies to "remain neutral in any organizing campaign."
This time, an E.P.A. spokesman said, the agency has not engaged with Daimler.
Mr. Fain said on Thursday that the union has worked with the administration, and he laid the responsibility for the possible strike at management's feet. But he was aware of the political ramifications of a major labor action in a swing state.
"You're either going to stand with the working-class people and the people that make this country move and make this world move, or they're going to stand with corporations and business leaders and the billionaires," he said. "And if that's what they choose, then when it comes time to vote, we can see a shift."
Pro-union groups want to see Democrats step up. Ahead of the Volkswagen vote in Chattanooga, Tenn., the Republican governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas issued a statement saying that unionizing would jeopardize auto jobs in their states. Erica Smiley, the executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively, said on Thursday that Mr. Cooper should draw a contrast in North Carolina, which has been largely anti-union.
"Workers are doing their part to ask for democracy and to fight for it," she said. "They're giving an opportunity for us and for politicians like Roy Cooper to right centuries of wrongs."
A Daimler spokeswoman, Anja Weinert, said the company was continuing to negotiate "in good faith."
Any new contract should "allow Daimler Truck North America to continue delivering the products that enable our customers to keep the world moving," she said.
The U.A.W. sees it differently. On Thursday, it filed four complaints with Mr. Biden's National Labor Relations Board, accusing Daimler Truck of retaliating against union organizers, interfering with collective bargaining, discriminating against union members and bargaining in bad faith.
The union, which has already endorsed the president's re-election, would clearly like help from Mr. Biden. In talking points ahead of the strike, the U.A.W. leaned into the electric school bus subsidies.
"The government is spending up to $ 345,000 per bus in taxpayer money," union officials wrote. "Meanwhile, the workers who build the product see their quality of life going in the wrong direction. Members are asking: Why should American taxpayer dollars subsidize corporate greed?"

Menendez Bribery Trial Shines Legal Spotlight On Intent and Marriage: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez is charged with steering aid to Egypt and meddling in criminal inquiries in return for gold, cash and a fancy car. His wife is charged too.
It had been a busy Thursday for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
He was in Washington presiding over the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as it heard testimony about the need for sustained aid to Ukraine, and then preparing to travel to Philadelphia with his wife, Nadine Menendez, to accept an award from an Armenian-American organization.
Back at home, the F.B.I. was watching.
An agent, conducting surveillance near the couple's modest, split-level house in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., snapped a photo of a Mercedes-Benz convertible parked out front, a court filing shows. Several weeks later, investigators searching the home would find 13 bars of gold bullion and more than $ 480,000 in cash, much of it stashed in coat jackets, boots and a safe.
On Monday, almost two years to the day after that agent was watching the senator's house, Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, is to go on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, charged with taking part in an elaborate, yearslong bribery scheme.
It will be his second corruption trial in seven years, but unlike the first, which ended in a hung jury, there is a volatile and surprising new element: charges against Mr. Menendez's wife.
The case, prosecutors have indicated, is as much about Ms. Menendez as it is about her husband. The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York has depicted Mr. Menendez and his wife as collaborators who took bribes in exchange for the senator's willingness to steer weapons and government aid to Egypt, prop up a friend's halal meat monopoly and meddle in criminal investigations involving allies.
"What else can the love of my life do for you?" Ms. Menendez asked at a Washington steakhouse dinner during one of the many meetings that prosecutors say she arranged between her husband and Egyptian officials.
Together, prosecutors contend, the couple were entangled in corrupt schemes that began even before their marriage in October 2020. The bribes, which also included a diamond ring and home furnishings, helped Mr. and Ms. Menendez live above their lawful means, prosecutors say.
But that partnership may now be fracturing, as the senator's lawyers appear to be preparing a defense that pins much of the blame on his wife.
Separate Trials
Ms. Menendez was to have been on trial with her husband this week, but a judge postponed her trial until July after her lawyers said she had a "serious medical condition" that required surgery and a potentially prolonged period of recovery.
Although she will not be at the defense table, she is expected to loom uncomfortably over the proceedings. By the government's telling, Ms. Menendez, 57, was an essential cog in a wheel of corruption. She served as a conduit for bribes and as a go-between who relayed messages in emails and texts, sometimes using what she and her husband called her "007" phone.
The senator's lawyers have said in legal papers that Mr. Menendez may, if he testifies, say he was duped by the woman he married less than four years ago, that she "withheld information" and that she "led him to believe that nothing unlawful was taking place."
Such a tactic presents challenges, given the couple's public persona as loyal partners who traveled and attended events together, said Tatiana R. Martins, a former chief of the Southern District's public corruption unit who is now in private practice.
Ms. Martins said the senator's lawyers might argue that his wife "did this all on her own; he had no idea; she kept it from him," but prosecutors could seek to rebut that by introducing evidence of how close the two were and how they shared everything.
"They have this great relationship, yet she's keeping all this from him?" Ms. Martins said.
As for Ms. Menendez, even if her husband's strategy is to try to shift blame, such testimony would almost certainly be inadmissible at her trial, said Jonathan Kravis, a defense lawyer in Washington and former trial attorney with the Justice Department's public integrity section.
The postponement of Ms. Menendez's trial will also give her and her lawyers a preview of the full scope of the government's case and enable them to make strategic adjustments as needed, he said.
"This is obviously not how the government wants to do it," Mr. Kravis said. But, he added, the separate trials were "not a death blow, for either case, by any means."
'A persecution'
Mr. Menendez will be tried alongside two New Jersey businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who were also charged in the bribery conspiracy. All three have pleaded not guilty, as has Ms. Menendez.
Mr. Menendez, who is near the end of his third full term, has consistently maintained his innocence and has left open the possibility of running for re-election in November. On the Senate floor in January, he attacked the Southern District prosecutors, saying they were engaged "not in a prosecution but a persecution" and were seeking "victory, not justice."
The charges, disclosed in a September indictment, shook Washington and prompted even Mr. Menendez's most stalwart Democratic allies to call for his resignation. The brazen nature of the charges has also fueled a backlash against so-called machine politics in New Jersey, which has, in turn, significantly increased the challenges his son, Representative Robert Menendez, faces as he seeks a second House term.
The trial is expected to delve into issues of political intrigue at home and abroad at a moment of heightened scrutiny over legislative self-dealing. Two weeks ago, Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, and his wife were charged with taking bribes from companies controlled by the government of Azerbaijan, intensifying interest in the role played by foreign agents.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have argued in court that by charging the senator, who has represented New Jersey in Congress since 1993, prosecutors are seeking to criminalize routine legislative actions. In one filing, the lawyers said "the government's apparent zeal to 'get back' at Senator Menendez for defeating its prior prosecution has overwhelmed its sound judgment."
The senator's lawyers have also asked the judge, Sidney H. Stein, to allow them to present the jury with the testimony of a psychiatrist, Karen B. Rosenbaum, who has examined the senator. She has concluded, they said, that "fear of scarcity" stemming from Mr. Menendez's father's death by suicide and his parents' history as Cuban refugees led to a "longstanding coping mechanism of routinely withdrawing and storing cash in his home" -- a theory that defense lawyers will presumably use to explain the money seized by investigators.
In summarizing the psychiatrist's findings, the senator's lawyers also disclosed that Mr. Menendez's father, a compulsive gambler, died after Mr. Menendez stopped paying off his gambling debts, contributing to what they called "intergenerational trauma."
Federal prosecutors oppose allowing Dr. Rosenbaum's testimony, questioning the scientific basis for her conclusions and arguing that the defense is trying to "engender sympathy" from the jury improperly.
Gin and cigars
The senator's trial will also pull back the curtain on the spending habits of a couple who hopscotched around the world with congressional delegations, attended state dinners at the White House and entertained often.
In one legal filing, prosecutors noted Mr. Menendez's preference for "luxury items such as Bombay Sapphire gin, cigars and upscale meals."
The detail prompted a tart response from the senator's lawyers, who noted that Bombay sells for $ 23.99 at Target.
"Hardly a top-shelf liquor, nothing about Bombay Sapphire gin smells of excess or is beyond Senator Menendez's financial abilities as a lifetime public servant," they wrote.
Judge Stein ruled this month that he would permit the introduction of the evidence, saying it was "inextricably intertwined with the evidence of the charged crimes."
The indictment is filled with references to money, and to its absence.
Ms. Menendez, who divorced her first husband in 2005, was unemployed when she began dating Mr. Menendez in early 2018. Ten months later, she was involved in a fatal pedestrian motor vehicle accident that left her without a car, a need that prosecutors say led to one of the first bribes, the Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Jose Uribe, a former insurance broker charged with the senator in the alleged conspiracy, has pleaded guilty. He admitted in court in March that he had given Ms. Menendez the $ 60,000 convertible in return for the senator's help in trying to disrupt an insurance fraud investigation in New Jersey.
"I knew that giving a car in return for influencing a United States senator to stop a criminal investigation was wrong, and I deeply regret my actions," Mr. Uribe told Judge Stein.
When Ms. Menendez nearly lost her home to foreclosure in 2019, Mr. Hana used his halal meat certification company to pay $ 23,569 to erase her mortgage debt and he and Mr. Uribe continued to "facilitate the payments," prosecutors say.
Ms. Menendez and her first husband bought the house, built in 1960, when their two children were young. The plan was to tear it down and rebuild, according to two former close friends. Instead, over time, the small house with faded white siding began to appear run-down and out of place in a neighborhood of knockdowns replaced by mansions with three-car garages and conspicuous stone facades.
After the senator moved in, in 2020, messages relayed on cellphones seized by investigators and included in court filings showed Ms. Menendez beckoning handymen to the house to trim trees, lay carpet, deliver a power washer and repair the garage door.
In an interview with the F.B.I., one person said he had given Ms. Menendez a lawn mower, but when the senator learned of it, "he became angry" and told her that "she had to pay."
But by 2022, after the couple's house was searched, they were working together to try to cover their tracks, prosecutors said.
Mr. Menendez wrote his wife a check for the amount Mr. Hana had paid toward the mortgage, adding a handwritten memo indicating it was "to liquidate loan," prosecutors said. She then reimbursed Mr. Hana, through his lawyer, noting it was "full payment of Wael Hana loan," according to the indictment.
The Menendezes also refunded the car payments.
The money, prosecutors said, was not a loan, but a bribe payment -- "as Menendez and Nadine Menendez well knew."
In March, prosecutors announced a new charge against the Menendezes: obstruction of justice.

Full text: At first, the children zipping around on bikes, roller skates and skateboards took little notice of the world famous athlete riding among them. Lot 11, tucked underneath a bustling Interstate I-95, is a haven for all things wheels. That's where Nigel Sylvester perched on a ramp and surveyed the concrete slabs covering the skatepark's landscape.
His opening cleared. Sylvester churned his black and blue Air Jordans, gaining speed on his Specialized bike. He jumped and the bike did too, causing it to dance across a rail. Sylvester rotated the handlebars in a circle before hitting the ground. He turned left sharply, twisting the bike's frame in a complete rotation before using his left hand to rotate the handlebars again.
To most, the quick moves would have looked flawless. But Sylvester had felt a hitch. Like an actor trying to nail a scene, he attempted the same moves several times. With each try, another child or two stopped skating or biking to bask in Sylvester's array of explosive tricks.
They received a preview of what Sylvester's legion of fans would soon see. During each trick, Sylvester's friend and longtime collaborator, Ralphy Ramos, pedalled in his shadow, leaning low, camera extended to record every move. The best series of successive tricks would be plucked and broadcast to Sylvester's significant social media following, which includes nearly a million Instagram and YouTube followers.
"Riding is one thing," Sylvester said. "Riding in front of the camera is a whole other thing. It's like when you go to the gym and you're by yourself and then you're at an actual basketball game in front of 30,000 people."
Sylvester, 36, may be the world's best known motocross athlete today as he vaults the sport into new territory. Jay-Z touted him in a song ("Nigel Sylvester with these bike flips"). Michael Jordan's brand awarded him his own signature shoe. High-end businesses like Mercedes-Benz, Oakley and Hermes clamor for Sylvester to associate himself with their brands.
"When I think about it now," Sylvester said recently. "I really want to be one of the greatest to ever touch a bicycle."
How Sylvester goes about achieving that greatness is what sets him apart from traditional athletes. Jordan and Serena Williams achieved GOAT status by winning championship after championship. LeBron James and Wayne Gretzky accumulated unthinkable statistics. Muhammad Ali went head-to-head with Joe Frazier. But for Sylvester there are no titles, no records, no on-field rivalries.
You won't find Sylvester among the cohort of BMX athletes preparing for the July start of the Olympics in Paris and hoping to win a gold medal. He does not compete. He cultivated his fame through social media, inventing and landing tricks and inviting others on his journey as he navigated urban landscapes.
"He just keeps on progressing and making everything cool and you can't compete with that," said T.J. Lavin, a retired BMX pro and host of MTV's "The Challenge." "All the competitors and all the people in the contests and all that stuff, good for them. He's just a little bit too cool to compete."
SYLVESTER PLAYED BACKYARD BASKETBALL and street football while growing up in the Laurelton neighborhood of Jamaica, Queens. His mother forbid him from playing organized tackle football. He got cut from his middle school basketball team.
Around that time, Sylvester first watched the X Games on ESPN, a new broadcasting venture that highlighted extreme sports competitions like skateboarding, snowboarding and motocross. The games may have seemed misplaced given ESPN's traditional coverage of sports like basketball, football and baseball. But it had an impact on Sylvester's generation and granted even more legitimacy to sports that he grew up with.
A bike became Sylvester's passport. Sometimes, on garbage days, Sylvester and his friends rummaged through trash in search of parts to assemble a bicycle one crooked frame and one flat wheel at a time. He received his first real bike, a 1998 Mongoose Sniper, from his parents. He immediately removed the brakes, something he still does with his bikes today.
On two wheels, he canvassed different neighborhoods and boroughs, from a skate park in the Bronx to biking ramps in Manhattan. He began buying BMX magazines, plastering the photos to his bedroom wall.
After the X Games, Sylvester asked his parents to take him to Camp Woodward, a destination Pennsylvania summer spot for extreme sports. The price, he was told, was too expensive.
He turned fully to street riding, where the world of concrete, marble and jutting angles proved inspiring.
"You can't control the environment," Sylvester said. "You can't control the weather. You can't control people walking by. You can't control the traffic. You can't control the natural elements, which is also why I love it so much. Because it's about figuring out how to manipulate the environment to execute the trick you want to execute, and express your art."
At 18, Sylvester turned pro, signing with Dave Mirra's MirraCo. He could count the number of Black professional BMX athletes on one hand. Some members of his family did not understand his pursuit.
Before the internet became a part of everyday life, BMX athletes could only make their names by being featured in a magazine or on a VHS or DVD compilation. The best competed in the televised contests. But Sylvester was part of a new age who grew up online and he started uploading videos early on. "I started to understand the power of storytelling, understand the power of content," Sylvester said. "Once I had the control of my content, it's like I want to channel the things that influenced me throughout my life: music, fashion, style, travel."
His breakthrough came a little more than a decade ago with a daredevil jump in one of New York's most instantly recognizable settings: the subway.
The idea was to jump the tracks and for weeks Sylvester scouted different stations with friends throughout the boroughs.
He finally chose the 145th Street station in Harlem. Sylvester measured the distance, platform to platform, determining he could not gain enough speed by approaching it straight. Instead, he would have to ride parallel to the tracks before turning sharply.
Sylvester took his bike to the station at around 2 a.m. on the morning of the attempt. He knew he had one shot before someone would notice him. He built up speed before veering as his momentum carried him over the platform's edge, propelling him onto the next set of subway tracks.
He has landed bigger jumps. But this one was different. Viewers knew subways. They could relate to just how far he had traveled and the risk he was taking.
"Once I saw the reaction from it, I knew we unlocked a new level," Sylvester said. "People looked at us differently. People looked at myself as an athlete differently from that moment."
SEVERAL YEARS AGO SYLVESTER LAUNCHED GO, an immersive film project that allows the audience to ride with him in cities like Dubai, Paris and London.
Its popularity is similar to how the YouTuber PewDiePie cultivated his fan base, said Karen North, a clinical professor of communication at the University of Southern California.
Internet personalities do not necessarily become successful by accomplishing the extraordinary feats most cannot do, North said.
"It's them doing the thing that we can do, but doing it better so that it feels like we're along for the ride," North said.
One recent journey Sylvester took followers on was a global hunt to land a switch crooked grind to a tail whip -- grinding his bike crookedly on a rail, kicking the bike in the air and landing back on it.
He tried but failed to stick it on a visit to Australia. Later, in Los Angeles, he thought he had found the ideal rail, but a series of failed attempts told him different. Finally, home in New York, he came across a rail in Brooklyn that he thought would give him the angle needed to land the trick. After a close try, he finally successfully nailed it.
"That's part of what we do as BMX athletes," Sylvester said. "We'll travel the world to land just one trick because there's so much that comes along with it. Of course, it's bragging rights. It's the clout. You're the first one to do it. It's for respect of it all. A brand sees you land a trick like that and it's like, 'Oh, nah, he's the one."'
Competing, North said, could only puncture the mystique of Sylvester's brand. It is one that Sylvester has worked meticulously to build.
In 2021, Sylvester became the first BMX athlete to sign with the Jordan Brand. His Air Jordan collaboration three years earlier, featuring a distressed Jordan 1 that represented the wear-and-tear from biking, quickly sold out.

"If you think about how creative M.J. was, and how impactful he was to the game of basketball, we really look at Nigel in that same vein, where he's doing something that we hadn't seen before," said Anthony DiCosmo, the head of global sports marketing for Jordan Brand.
Sylvester has faced criticism about his endorsements and incorporating music and fashion into his brand, especially early on.
The criticism disappointed him. He thought that he was only pushing forward a sport he loved.
"I was going about it in a different way, and that way it was new, and people feared it," Sylvester said. "People within the world of BMX feared that new."
What was once new is now the new standard. Sylvester's path to success mirrors the rise of influencers who have used the internet to propel themselves to stardom. As his audience keeps expanding, he is looking to use his stature in new ways. In 2021, for example, he created a foundation that aims to distribute 10,000 bikes to children. He rode his out of Queens. Others, he said, can do the same.
"I believe in the power of the bicycle," Sylvester said. "I think it's one of the most incredible vehicles in the world. It's boundless. It goes beyond race and beyond religion, beyond social class, even beyond geography."

Nobody Saw Andy Kim Coming. That Was His Strategy.: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Kim, the New Jersey congressman, has become the odds-on favorite to win Robert Menendez's Senate seat. His strategy? Don't ask anyone for permission.
Facing federal charges that he accepted bribes, including cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, Senator Robert Menendez announced on Friday, Sept. 22, that he would not resign.
A day later, Andy Kim, a little-known Democratic congressman from southern New Jersey, gathered his top advisers for a conference call. Everyone present assumed that Mr. Kim would announce his intention to challenge Mr. Menendez for his Senate seat.
The question was when.
Zack Carroll, who was Mr. Kim's campaign manager during his first race for Congress in 2018, told the group that a typical campaign launch takes six weeks. After all, he would need to hire staff, compile a list of potential donors and create a website, a rollout video, a media plan and some slogans. And Mr. Kim would need the blessing of political bosses across the state, an especially urgent task in New Jersey, where local party leaders have held enormous sway over primary elections for generations.
"You don't upset a two-term incumbent by flying by the seat of your pants," Mr. Carroll said.
Mr. Kim listened quietly. Then he read aloud his campaign announcement.
"What if I were to announce in three hours?" Mr. Kim said.
The announcement, which Mr. Kim posted on social media that afternoon, kicked off perhaps the luckiest Senate campaign in modern New Jersey history. Over the next six months, Mr. Kim went from underdog to front-runner, outmaneuvering Tammy Murphy, the wife of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, who joined the race in November and quickly won the support of New Jersey's powerful Democratic Party machine.
In late March, Mr. Menendez said he would not run in the party's primary. Three days later, Ms. Murphy ended her campaign.
Mr. Kim is not yet a U.S. senator. There are two other candidates in the Democratic primary and four candidates running on the Republican side, although no Republican has won a Senate seat from New Jersey since 1972. Mr. Menendez has also left open the possibility of running for re-election as an independent. But Mr. Kim has now become the odds-on favorite.
Along the way, he also won a stunning ruling in federal court in March barring party chairs from designing ballots in this June's Democratic primary that give preferential treatment to their endorsed candidates, potentially upending New Jersey politics into the future.
"It is probably the most significant shift in New Jersey politics in decades," said Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City and a candidate for governor in 2025.
Seizing the moment
Over his six years in Congress, Mr. Kim, 41, has appeared to his constituents as a nerdy and earnest public servant, said Patrick Murray, director of The Polling Institute at Monmouth University in New Jersey. This image went national on Jan. 7, 2021, when he was photographed gathering trash left by rioters in the U.S. Capitol rotunda.
"I thought he was a staffer," said Andrew Harnik, who took the pictures for The Associated Press. "I'm not sure I've ever seen something like that before, a member of Congress on his hands and knees, picking up trash."
This year's Senate race has showcased two other traits that have proved central to Mr. Kim's political career: An insider with the tactics of an outsider, he often seizes big moments that others miss.
"He's like Clark Kent," said Chris Russell, a Republican strategist who managed two failed congressional campaigns against Mr. Kim. "He comes off as inoffensive and well meaning and nice. Behind the scenes, this guy is a political animal. He is very shrewd, very calculating."
Mr. Kim grew up in Moorestown, N.J., the same suburb of Philadelphia where he now lives. After high school he attended Deep Springs College, an elite two-year institution in an otherwise deserted valley in California. At the time, enrollment at the school was limited to 26 students.
News of the Sept. 11 terror attacks left the college's students and 10 staff and faculty members feeling paralyzed, said Jack Newell, then the college's president. Mr. Kim, then 19 years old, asked to organize a gathering that evening to process the attacks.
"That proved to be a turning event for all of us," Mr. Newell said. "Responding to an emergency situation is an instinct. And Andy is one of the people who does have it."
Mr. Kim later graduated from the University of Chicago and won a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University. Next came a speedy rise in foreign policy, including time advising Gen. David Petraeus, then the commander of American forces in Afghanistan. At age 31, Mr. Kim became the only member of the National Security Council advising President Barack Obama on Iraq.
It was a sleepy assignment until 2014, when the terrorist group ISIS led a military campaign across northwestern Iraq aimed in part at exterminating the Yazidi, a Kurdish religious minority. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled into the Sinjar mountains, where they were trapped without water or food.
Mr. Kim's job in the White House seemed mundane: schedule interagency meetings and draft agendas. But he managed to get leaders focused on saving the Yazidis, even under a president who had built his political career on ending America's military engagement in Iraq, said Tom Malinowski, then an assistant Secretary of State.
On the morning of Aug. 7, 2014, Mr. Kim chased down Denis McDonough, the president's chief of staff. Vaulting over layers of protocol, Mr. Kim, the junior staffer, described the urgent situation to Mr. McDonough, who asked him to draft possible responses.
That evening, the president authorized a plan, drafted by Mr. Kim, to airdrop supplies to the Yazidis, followed by airstrikes on ISIS militants intent on genocide.
"He is an extremely deliberate, thoughtful, careful guy," Susan Rice, the national security adviser at the time, said of Mr. Kim. "But also gutsy."
A long-shot campaign
After Donald J. Trump was elected president in 2016, Mr. Kim moved back to New Jersey to challenge Tom MacArthur, a two-term Republican congressman, former insurance executive and millionaire who paid most of his own campaign expenses. Camden County's powerful Democratic Party machine had decided that the seat was impossible for a Democrat to win, Mr. Kim said in a recent interview, so he did not seek its support. He did enlist his influential friends, however, including Ms. Rice, who organized a fund-raiser.
"'I don't frankly think you've got a great shot'," Ms. Rice said she told Mr. Kim at the time. "'But I'll do what I can."'
Mr. MacArthur had sponsored legislation to let insurance companies charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions. Mr. Kim made it the central issue of his campaign, describing his opponent as indifferent to his constituents' lives.
Republican campaign aides say Mr. Kim's strategy hit below the belt. Mr. MacArthur's mother died of cancer when he was 4; years later, his 11-year-old daughter died from a rare neurological disorder.
"He tries to portray the nice-guy image, but he proved himself to be rather nasty," said Adam Geller, who ran polling for Mr. MacArthur.
Mr. Kim won by less than 4,000 votes. A month after he was sworn in, he introduced legislation to cut prescription drug prices for seniors; a version of the bill later passed with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. He also worked to maintain funding for a large military base in his district, and held monthly town halls.
After he spent two terms representing an area where Mr. Trump won twice, redistricting turned Mr. Kim's district safely Democratic. He cast that safety aside to challenge Mr. Menendez -- without even a phone call to Democratic Party bosses -- a move many insiders believed would end his career.
"If he were a careerist, he wouldn't have announced" so quickly, said Mr. Murray at Monmouth University. Without boss support, "you were probably a dead duck," he said.
Others viewed the move as cunning.
"There was one lane for someone to run as the principled outsider against the machine that Menendez had represented," said Mr. Malinowski, the former assistant Secretary of State, who won a New Jersey race for Congress in 2018 and had considered challenging Mr. Menendez himself. "And there would be a great advantage to whoever occupied that lane first."
The first lady's challenge
Tammy Murphy entered the race in November. A political neophyte, Ms. Murphy won immediate support from county bosses including in Bergen County, home to one of the largest blocks of registered Democrats in the state. The county's party chair, Paul Juliano, is also president and chief executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, a job that pays $ 280,000 a year and was awarded by Ms. Murphy's husband, the governor.
"I didn't come from a powerful, politically connected family," said Mr. Kim, whose father was a geneticist and mother was a nurse. "The first lady, this is her first time running, and she's coming into this as part of the most powerful political family in New Jersey."
But Democratic voters, particularly progressive activists, expressed frustration with what they considered nepotism, and her campaign struggled to catch fire.
"Tammy Murphy represents the arrogance of the party bosses," said Valerie Huttle, a former New Jersey state assemblywoman who was ostracized from the party after she challenged a boss-endorsed candidate for state senate in 2021. "That's what I think helped Andy."
If his decision to challenge Mr. Menendez without asking the party's permission was an insult to New Jersey's Democratic Party machine, Mr. Kim's subsequent lawsuit seeking to end the machine's most powerful tool -- control over election ballot design -- was a direct attack.
Mr. Kim sued the state's county clerks in federal court, arguing that the ballots designed by county bosses violated his constitutional rights. Candidates endorsed by their local party appear together in the same row. Those who fail to win the endorsement are relegated to "ballot Siberia," Mr. Kim argued, making it difficult for voters to find them.
Grassroots activists, who had spent years fighting for reform, were ecstatic.
"Andy was the right person at the right time to take on the establishment," said Yael Niv, president of the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey.
Mr. Kim's campaign has focused more broadly on government reform, betting that voters will view structural issues like gerrymandering and the filibuster as blocking progress on abortion rights, gun control and health care.
"Process and policy, you can't separate the two," he said in an interview. "In order for me to pass women's reproductive rights in America, we have to have filibuster reform."
Mr. Kim also has pursued an inside game. His campaign raised $ 2.7 million by January, enough to be "armed to the teeth" with television ads in the New York and Philadelphia television markets, he said. He also attended up to five house parties a day, an organizing effort aimed at winning the same county nominations he was attacking in court.
"We talked a lot about how he could run both the inside and outside campaign," Mr. Malinowski said of conversations with Mr. Kim in late 2023. "The bosses would feel the heat."
Five days after Ms. Murphy dropped out, a federal judge granted Mr. Kim's request for an emergency injunction, ordering a new ballot design for the Democratic primary.
The decision capped a remarkable six months in New Jersey politics in which two of the state's most powerful politicians fell like dominoes, Democratic Party bosses lost the linchpin of their control over elections, and Mr. Kim -- through a combination of tactical skill and sheer luck -- became both the beneficiary and face of a once-in-generations change in New Jersey politics.
"This race is not only going to produce a new senator, but a completely new way of picking our leaders in New Jersey," Mr. Malinowski said. "No one would have predicted it a year ago."

Roomy Enough for a Retinue and a Met Gala Dress: [Style Desk]

Full text: Famous actors, singers, athletes and housewives are fans of the Mercedes-Benz van, which has become a staple in streets outside events like the Met Gala.
When Kendall Jenner attended the 2022 Met Gala in a Prada gown with an enormous flowing skirt, getting her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art required special transportation. A limousine would not do, nor would an SUV -- walking in the dress was a challenge; sitting, impossible. The solution: Ms. Jenner would be driven, standing, in a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
On the way to the event, as a way to relieve her anxiety about running late, Ms. Jenner relieved herself in an ice bucket while standing in the van. "Best decision I ever made," she said of that moment in an episode of "The Kardashians" on Hulu.
The Sprinter van, a towering box on wheels with nearly six-and-a-half feet of head room, is a direct descendant of the earliest motorized caravans developed by Karl Benz in 1896. (Some 30 years later, he and Gottlieb Daimler founded the Mercedes-Benz company.) The Sprinter, first released in Europe in 1995, started being sold domestically in 2010. Last year, Mercedes-Benz unveiled an electric version.
The van -- which can be used to transport up to 15 passengers (or cargo) -- is appreciated by automotive enthusiasts for its build quality, reliability and versatility, as well as for the thrust and longevity of the diesel engine in most versions.
But other people have come to recognize the Sprinter for different reasons, among them its proximity to celebrities. The van has become a preferred mode of transportation for actors, singers, athletes and "Real Housewives," and is now a staple in streets outside star-studded events like the Oscars and the Met Gala.
The vans have become so popular as transportation to the spring gala in New York that demand for them can outstrip the local supply. "Sprinters are being brought in from Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami," said Etienne Haro, the general manager of the Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where many Met Gala guests spend time both before and after the main event.
In recent years, between 50 and 70 guests have traveled to the gala from the Mark, with about 40to 50 of those people riding in Sprinters. Many of those vans are rented and driven by guests' personal chauffeurs. On the day of the gala, the Mark has a team of about 30 people tracking vehicles' locations to ensure their passengers arrive punctually, Mr. Haro said.
Sprinter riders often take advantage of the van's roomy interior to ensure they also arrive looking flawless. "The entourage, glam team, stylist -- everyone can hop in to put on the finishing touches," Mr. Haro said.
But occasionally, he added, some Sprinter passengers have hit bumps in the road on their way to and from the gala.
"Getting out of a Sprinter with a voluminous gown and high heels can be challenging," Mr. Haro said, noting one instance in which a Mark employee caught a Met Gala guest "in midair" as she was falling out of a van. He recalled another guest "whose dress was so intricate that she could not enter her vehicle."
Though it bears Mercedes-Benz's three-point-star logo, the Sprinter has an otherwise innocuous exterior that, for some famous fans, has as much appeal as its capacious interior.
"Our clients say, 'The paparazzi are chasing us around; we don't want to be in something that's sticking out like a sore thumb, like a Rolls or a Bentley," said Howard Becker, the founder of Becker Automotive Design in Southern California, which has customized Sprinter vans and other vehicles for people like the director Steven Spielberg, the actor Mark Wahlberg and the television host Steve Harvey.
"The Sprinter kind of fades in," said Mr. Becker, 75.
The starting price for a diesel-engine van is about $ 50,000; electric Sprinters start at about $ 72,000. But models outfitted by Mr. Becker or by Gabi Mashal, whose Southern California company Bespoke Coach also customizes the vans, typically cost between $ 350,000 and $ 450,000.
Their distinctive features can include temperature-controlled, lie-flat seats with built-in massagers, secure internet routers, state-of-the-art stereo and video systems and onboard bathrooms for their owners.
"These people can't use a public restroom," said Mr. Mashal, 60, who has customized vans for the singer Mark Anthony and the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.
The Sprinter's size and luxurious reputation are reasons it has replaced vehicles like limousines and SUVs as the rental transportation of choice on many versions of "The Real Housewives," said Nate Green, an executive producer of "The Real Housewives of Miami." He described the Sprinter as a friend of the "Housewives," using a term given to supporting characters in the franchise who appear regularly in episodes.
Mr. Green said his show's crew also favors Sprinters because the van's cabin has enough room for camera operators to stand -- and to film from several angles.
"This is really important," Mr. Green said, "because 'Housewives' is sometimes more about the reaction than about the actual dialogue."
Throughout the reality TV franchise's 18 years on Bravo, Sprinter vans have been a place where housewives have drunkenly fallen down, signed divorce papers, passionately kissed co-stars, engaged in verbal spats and been approached by officers with the Department of Homeland Security.
"When people see a Sprinter van, they know that there's going to be something that happens that's going to be iconic," said Lisa Shannon, an executive producer of the New York and Salt Lake City installments of "The Real Housewives," as well as its "Ultimate Girls Trip" spinoff.
The Sprinter, while strongly associated with the "Housewives" franchise, has appeared in more than 4,000 movies and TV episodes. Like many tokens of pop culture, it has been imitated on "The Simpsons," and it recently joined one of cinema's most distinguishable automotive fleets: the vehicles in "Ghostbusters."
In the series's latest film, "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire," released in March, a new van called Ecto-Z -- a black Sprinter outfitted with racks for proton packs -- is featured alongside the tail-finned 1959 Cadillac ambulance known to many as the Ecto-1.
Eric Reich, an executive producer of "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire," said a Sprinter was chosen for the Ecto-Z role after Mercedes-Benz and Sony, the film's distributor, had meetings to discuss product placement. He added that a Sprinter, like a Cadillac, made sense for transporting the Ghostbusters and their gear because both vehicles blend "luxury and function."
That amalgamation has also made Sprinters popular among so-called vanlifers -- people known for cavorting, traveling and sleeping in customized vans. Many of them document their lifestyles online, including Peter Holcombe, 51, who has spent much of the last decade living with his wife, Kathy, 50, and daughter, Abby, 19, in four Sprinter vans outfitted by the motor-home company Winnebago. (The Holcombes are brand ambassadors for Mercedes-Benz and Winnebago; they bought three of their vans at a discount.)
In their vans, the family has visited all 50 states, several national parks and 19 European countries. (Last year, Abby moved out of the family vehicle and into one of her own.) The Holcombes are currently driving what's known as the Pan-American Highway, a network of roads that runs from Alaska to the southern tip of South America.
"We've done over 400,000 miles in Sprinters," Mr. Holcombe said.
Wes Siler, a backcountry camper and a columnist for Outside magazine in Bozeman, Mont., is less of a fan.
Mr. Siler, 43, who camps out of a converted pickup truck, said the cost of buying and customizing a Sprinter for outdoor exploring is excessive for what he described as little more than a "poseur backdrop."
"They're cool on Instagram," he said. "That's, like, the entire story."
But even Mr. Siler, who grew up in Europe, recognizes that the van has a certain appeal. He recalled getting to prom at his high school in London in a Sprinter that had been outfitted as a party bus.
"You couldn't want a better limo," he said.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez's attorneys want a psychiatrist to testify at his corruption trial about the impact of his father's death by suicide. Prosecutors are objecting.
When Senator Robert Menendez was charged last year with participating in a complex bribery scheme, news headlines highlighted a peculiar detail: Investigators had discovered more than $ 480,000 in cash and 13 bars of gold during a June 2022 search of his house in New Jersey.
Days later, the senator offered an explanation for the cash, saying he routinely withdrew large sums of money from his savings account, a custom he said he had learned from his Cuban immigrant parents.
Now, Mr. Menendez's lawyers have gone further, asserting that the habit was rooted in deep psychological trauma tied to his father's suicide nearly 50 years ago and a family history of confiscated property in Cuba.
They want a psychiatrist who has evaluated Mr. Menendez, 70, to testify at the senator's federal corruption trial about what they have described as "traumatic experiences in his past associated with cash and finances."
In a newly disclosed letter, his lawyers link the father's death to a decision by Mr. Menendez that, according to the psychiatrist, caused him lifelong trauma -- and they want a jury to hear about it.
The psychiatrist, Karen B. Rosenbaum, would be expected to testify that Mr. Menendez "experienced trauma when his father, a compulsive gambler, died by suicide after Senator Menendez eventually decided to discontinue paying off his father's gambling debts," the senator's lawyers said last month in a letter to prosecutors.
On Wednesday, the government made it clear it objected to the doctor's proposed testimony.
The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York included a copy of the letter in a legal filing that asked the judge to preclude Dr. Rosenbaum from taking the witness stand. The prosecutors are challenging the scientific basis for the psychiatrist's conclusions and suggesting the defense is trying to evoke sympathy from jurors.
The dispute comes less than two weeks before the start of Mr. Menendez's widely anticipated trial in Manhattan, and offers yet another peek into the senator's potential defense strategy. The lawyers had previously indicated that he was poised to blame his wife, Nadine Menendez, for at least part of the bribery scheme.
Mr. Menendez's father's death and his family's history in Cuba left him with a "fear of scarcity" that led to a "longstanding coping mechanism of routinely withdrawing and storing cash in his home," the senator's lawyers, Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, wrote, summarizing Dr. Rosenbaum's conclusions.
The prosecutors, in asking the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, to bar the testimony, said Dr. Rosenbaum's opinion "does not appear to be the product of any reliable scientific principle or method."
They also argued that having the psychiatrist testify appeared to be an "impermissible attempt" by Mr. Menendez to make sure that the jury hears about the family history without subjecting himself to cross-examination by testifying.
The prosecutors also called it an improper effort to "engender sympathy based on his family background, in the guise of expert testimony."
They said that, at a minimum, if Judge Stein were inclined to allow Dr. Rosenbaum to testify, the prosecution should be able to have the senator examined by a psychiatrist retained by the government.
Mr. Menendez, a Democrat and former chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is accused of accepting bribes in exchange for his willingness to use his influence to help allies in New Jersey and to aid the governments of Egypt and Qatar.
He will be tried with two New Jersey businessmen who also were accused of participating in the bribery conspiracy. Ms. Menendez was charged as well but granted a separate trial, in July, after her lawyers said she had a serious medical condition that would require surgery and an extended period of recovery.
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
This dispute over the admissibility of the psychiatrist's testimony was previewed briefly for the judge in a hearing last week during which Mr. Fee outlined the defense's intentions and a prosecutor vigorously objected.
"Our view at the core is this is just wildly inappropriate as expert testimony," the prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, told the judge, according to a transcript of the proceeding.
Prosecutors have said that the cash and gold found during the search of Mr. Menendez's house were "fruits" of the bribery scheme.
Mr. Richenthal added, "Is essentially an expert allowed to get on the stand and say, 'I've talked to Mr. Menendez' -- who we have no right to call as a witness -- 'He told me X, and I conclude it's not from bribes."'
The indictment, which runs 66 pages, outlines a variety of schemes. But perhaps nothing has caught the public eye as much as its descriptions of the cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz convertible found in the search of the senator's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
Investigators discovered much of the cash stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, footwear, a duffel bag and a safe, according to legal filings.
After being charged in September, Mr. Menendez offered what he called an "old-fashioned" explanation for at least some of the cash discovered during the search. He said that for 30 years he had withdrawn money each week from his savings account for "emergencies."
He told reporters that he did this "because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba."
Prosecutors, however, have said that some of the cash discovered in the house was wrapped in bands showing it had been withdrawn, at least $ 10,000 at a time, from a bank where neither Mr. Menendez nor his wife had an account. This was an indication "that the money had been provided to them by another person," they wrote in court papers.
Mr. Menendez was born in New York City in 1954 to parents who had fled Cuba in the years before Fidel Castro seized control of the country. He has talked and written about growing up in a tenement apartment in Union City, a densely packed community in northern New Jersey that became a magnet for refugees of the Cuban diaspora.
His mother was a seamstress, and his father, a carpenter, died when Mr. Menendez was 23, he told The New York Times in 2005.
Dr. Rosenbaum, a forensic psychiatrist based in Manhattan, has testified in other high-profile criminal cases in New York. Reports filed with the Internal Revenue Service indicated that Mr. Menendez had used his legal defense fund to pay Dr. Rosenbaum $ 4,200 in late March.

Data Collection by Cars Is Drawing Scrutiny From U.S. Regulators: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Modern cars are internet-connected and have hundreds of sensors. Lawmakers and regulators have concerns about what's happening with all that data.
In the American imagination, car keys and a driver's license have long represented freedom, autonomy and privacy. But modern cars, which have hundreds of sensors, cameras and internet connectivity, are now potential spying machines acting in ways drivers do not completely understand.
That has lawmakers and regulators concerned.
On Tuesday, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to investigate automakers for sharing drivers' location information with the police. The senators, both Democrats, say this sharing can "seriously threaten Americans' privacy" by revealing their visits to protests, health clinics, places of worship, support groups or other sensitive places.
"As far-right politicians escalate their war on women, I'm especially concerned about cars revealing people who cross state lines to obtain an abortion," Senator Wyden said in a statement.
Government attention to the car industry is intensifying, experts say, because of the increased technological sophistication of modern cars.
Investigators for the Government Accountability Office recently went car shopping, undercover, to see whether salespeople were overselling autonomous driving abilities. In a March report, the agency concluded that consumers don't fully understand crash avoidance technologies and driver support systems, the improper use of which "can compromise their safety benefits and even pose a risk on the road."
The Federal Communications Commission and California lawmakers want to prevent mobile car apps from being used for stalking and harassment. The F.C.C. has proposed regulating automakers under the Safe Connections Act -- aimed, originally, at phone carriers -- while California is likely to pass a law that would accomplish the same thing, requiring car companies to cut off abusers' remote access to victims' cars.
"No survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between giving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those who can access its connectivity and data," Jessica Rosenworcel, who leads the F.C.C., said in a statement.
Privacy regulators have opened investigations. California's privacy regulator has been looking into data use from connected cars for nearly a year, while the F.T.C. already appears to be acting on a letter Senator Markey sent in February, urging the agency to investigate automakers' privacy practices.
Last month, the F.T.C. solicited reports from drivers who objected to how data from their cars had been used. An investigator from the agency reached out to a man named in a New York Times article whose insurance premium increased after General Motors provided data about his driving behavior to the insurance industry. ("Since FTC investigations are nonpublic, we generally don't comment on whether we are investigating a particular matter," said a spokesperson for the agency.)
"To my mind, there has been far too little oversight into automakers' privacy policies, so the more watchdogs, the better," Senator Wyden said.
The most recent letter to the F.T.C. reveals the findings of a yearlong query of 14 automakers that Senator Wyden's office said had jointly received more than 1,400 police requests for location information over the past two years.
Only five of the automakers -- G.M., Honda, Ford, Tesla and Stellantis -- required the police to get a warrant before turning over a car's current or historical whereabouts, with Ford recently enacting that requirement. Tesla is the only automaker that tells customers about such requests, according to the letter.
"In contrast, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge's approval," the senators wrote to Ms. Khan. They said this violated a commitment the automakers made in a set of privacy principles they submitted to the F.T.C. a decade ago about how they would protect drivers' sensitive data.
"This is a complex issue; automakers are committed to protecting sensitive vehicle location information," said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association. "Vehicle location information is only provided to law enforcement under specific and limited circumstances, such as when the automaker is provided a warrant or court order or in situations where there is an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death to an individual."
Automakers generally retain a car's location information for years -- as long as 15 years in the case of Hyundai. Of the 45 location data requests that Hyundai received in the past two years from the police, slightly more than half involved stolen vehicles, the company's spokesman, Ira Gabriel, said.
"There's a renewed focus on cars, and the data practices associated with them," said Andrew Crawford, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. He attributed this to increased consumer awareness about the components in modern cars and the fact that car data "may be going to folks that they did not contemplate, did not know about and did not want."
At the same time, however, some regulators are pushing automakers to put more technology into cars to improve safety on the roads, which may require even more data collection.
The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended in-car systems in all new vehicles that would tell drivers to slow down when they exceed the speed limit. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has taken steps to require impairment-detection systems in all new vehicles that would prevent a car from operating when the driver had been drinking or using drugs.
When it comes to car safety, the conversation has changed from improving seatbelts to installing more cameras and sensors, said Adonne Washington, a lawyer at the Future of Privacy Forum who wrote a recent report on the privacy implications of proposed safety systems.
For instance, "a mandate for alcohol detection technology in vehicles creates a whole different category of information," she said.
W. James Denvil, a partner at Hogan Lovells who has represented automakers, said the increased scrutiny from regulators was expected.
Vehicles offer "extraordinary benefits," he said. New technologies can enhance safety and the driving experience, while data from cars can be used to improve transportation infrastructure.
"We've got innovative technologies and old regulations," Mr. Denvil said. "There's going to be some surprises and some bumps in the road."

Daimler Truck Deal Averts Strike in North Carolina: [National Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers reached an agreement involving workers who make Freightliner trucks and Thomas Built buses. The deal comes as the union seeks to expand in Southern states.
The United Automobile Workers reached an 11th-hour deal on Friday with Daimler Truck in North Carolina that gave workers 25 percent raises over the next four years and averted a strike that would have begun Saturday.
The union had said it was ready to walk out if it could not agree on a new contract covering 7,300 Daimler employees. The previous contract expired on Friday. The German company has four factories in North Carolina, where it builds Freightliner and Western Star trucks, and Thomas Built buses. The union also represents workers at parts distribution centers in Atlanta and Memphis.
The deal, which includes profit sharing, automatic cost-of-living increases and equalizes pay among workers at the North Carolina factories, marks a victory for the U.A.W. as it tries to expand its power in Southern states where unions have long been weak.
"When that deadline came closer, the company suddenly became ready to talk," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W.'s leader, said late Friday as he announced the agreement, which will give workers raises of at least 16 percent the first year after they ratify the contract.
Daimler Trucks said in a statement that it hoped U.A.W. members would approve the tentative contracts, "for the mutual benefit of all parties."
A walkout would have had national political repercussions. North Carolina is a political battleground state that has a Democratic governor, but President Biden narrowly lost the state in 2020. Mr. Biden had indicated that he could step in aggressively to support the Daimler workers, possibly putting him at odds with the state's more pro-business Democrats just months before Election Day.
The U.A.W. has been making inroads in the South. It scored a significant victory this month when workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted to be represented by the union. Workers at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama will vote on whether to unionize in mid-May.
Workers at Daimler Truck, which split from Mercedes-Benz in 2021, have been represented by the U.A.W. for several decades. The union has adopted a more assertive stance after winning the biggest pay increases in decades for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Ram after strikes at the three companies last year.
The gains for workers at Daimler could add momentum to the U.A.W.'s drive to organize U.S. auto factories, including at companies like Toyota and Tesla.
Workers in North Carolina said they have been struggling to make ends meet while Daimler racked up big profits. The company, based in Stuttgart, reported net profit last year of 4 billion euros, or $ 4.25 billion, a 44 percent increase from a year earlier. Sales in the United States, Canada and Mexico generated more than half the profit.
The union points out that Thomas Built, whose yellow school buses are a common sight, has benefited from millions of dollars in federal subsidies for electric buses. Thomas Built workers have earned less than counterparts at other factories, but the deal will give them pay increases to make up the deficit.
"Workers who make trucks and workers who make buses will get equal pay for equal work," Mr. Fain said.
The agreement also includes provisions aimed at preserving jobs in North Carolina. Workers had sought more job security after the company moved some production to Mexico.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Beirut bureau chief for The Associated Press, he was kidnapped in 1985 by Islamic militants.
Terry Anderson, the American journalist who had been the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon when he was finally released in 1991 by Islamic militants after more than six years in captivity, died on Saturday at his home in Greenwood Lake, N.Y., in the Hudson Valley. He was 76.
The cause was apparently complications of recent heart surgery, his daughter Sulome Anderson said.
Mr. Anderson, the Beirut bureau chief for The Associated Press, had just dropped his tennis partner, an A.P. photographer, at his home after an early morning tennis match on March 16, 1985, when men armed with pistols yanked open his car door and shoved him into a Mercedes-Benz. The same car had tried to cut him off the day before as he returned to work from lunch at his seaside apartment.
The kidnappers, identified as Shia Hezbollah militants of the Islamic Jihad Organization in Lebanon, beat him, blindfolded him and kept him chained in some 20 hideaways for 2,454 days in Beirut, South Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.
The militants, supported by Iran, indicated that they were retaliating against Israel's use of American weapons in earlier strikes against Muslim and Druze targets in Lebanon. They had also been seeking to pressure the Reagan administration to secretly facilitate the illegal sales of weapons to Iran -- an embarrassing scheme that became known as the Iran-contra affair because the administration had planned to use proceeds from the arms sales to secretly subsidize the right-wing contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Mr. Anderson was the last of 18 Western hostages released by the kidnappers. After he was freed, he married his fiancé, Madeleine Bassil, who had been pregnant when he was kidnapped, and, for the first time, met his 6-year-old daughter.
While he had not been tortured during his captivity, he said, he was beaten and chained. He spent a year or so, on and off, in solitary confinement, he said.
"There is nothing to hold on to, no way to anchor my mind," he said after the ordeal. "I try praying, every day, sometimes for hours. But there's nothing there, just a blankness. I'm talking to myself, not God."
He found some consolation in the Bible, though, and added: "The only real defense was to remember that no one could take away my self-respect and dignity -- only I could do that."
Terry Alan Anderson was born on Oct. 27, 1947, in Lorain, Ohio, where his father, Glen, was the village police officer. When he was still young, the family moved to Batavia in western New York, where his father drove a truck and his mother, Lily (Lunn) Anderson, was a waitress.
After graduating from high school, he was accepted by the University of Michigan and offered a scholarship but decided to join the Marines instead. He served for five years in Japan, including in Okinawa, and in Vietnam, where he was a combat journalist. He spent a final year in Iowa as a recruiter.
After he was discharged, Mr. Anderson earned degrees in journalism and political science from Iowa State University while working for a local television station.
He worked for The A.P. in Japan and South Africa before beginning a two-and-a-half-year stint in Lebanon in 1983.
After his release, he owned a blues bar in Athens, Ohio, and ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the Ohio State Senate in 2004. He sued Iran for $ 100 million in damages in a federal court and eventually collected about $ 26 million from Iranian assets in the United States that had been frozen by the government. His windfall lasted about seven years; he filed for bankruptcy in 2009.
Mr. Anderson established a foundation, the Vietnam Children's Fund, with a friend, Marcia Landau, which built more than 50 schools in Vietnam. He also contributed $ 100,000 to endow the Father Lawrence Jenco Foundation, named for a fellow hostage who was the director of the Catholic Relief Services in Beirut. The foundation supports community service projects in Appalachia.
"Though my father's life was marked by extreme suffering during his time as a hostage in captivity, he found a quiet, comfortable peace in recent years," his daughter Sulome said. "I know he would choose to be remembered not by his very worst experience, but through his humanitarian work with the Vietnam Children's Fund, the Committee to Protect Journalists, homeless veterans and many other incredible causes."
Mr. Anderson taught at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University, the University of Kentucky, the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University and the University of Florida.
In addition to his daughter Sulome, he is survived by Ms. Bassil, his second of three wives, whom he married in 1993; another daughter, Gabrielle Anderson, by his first wife, Mihoko Anderson; a sister, Judy Anderson; and a brother, Jack.
Another sister, Peggy Say, figuratively wrapped America in a yellow ribbon of remembrance and rallied humanitarian groups and world figures to keep her younger brother from being forgotten after he was abducted. She died in 2015.
In 1993, Mr. Anderson published a memoir, "Den of Lions: Memoirs of Seven Years." In The New York Times Book Review, Prof. Eugene Kennedy of Loyola University in Chicago called it "an improbable and moving love story" of a world-weary correspondent guilty over a failed marriage who falls in love with a beautiful Lebanese Maronite Catholic, a relationship that restores his religious conviction and provides a spiritual foundation "for his surviving his arbitrarily brutal years as a captive."
As much as captivity was an ordeal, Mr. Anderson recalled, so was re-acclimating to what he called "the real world."
"I had problems, and it took me a long time to begin to cope with them," he said. "People ask me, 'Did you get over them?' I don't know! Ask my ex-wife -- ask my third ex-wife. I don't know; I am who I am."
"I was damaged a great deal more than I was aware of -- than anyone was aware of," he said, adding, "It takes as long to recover as the time you spent in prison."

U.A.W. Gets New Toehold In the South: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some experts say the outcome at a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., may be organized labor's most significant advance in decades. But the road could get rockier.
By voting to join the United Automobile Workers, Volkswagen workers in Tennessee have given the union something it has never had: a factory-wide foothold at a major foreign automaker in the South.
The result, in an election that ended on Friday, will enable the union to bargain for better wages and benefits. Now the question is what difference it will make beyond the Volkswagen plant.
Labor experts said success at VW might position the union to replicate its showing at other auto manufacturers throughout the South, the least unionized region of the country. Some argued that the win could help set off a rise in union membership at other companies that exceeds the uptick of the past few years, when unions won elections at Starbucks and Amazon locations.
"It's a big vote, symbolically and substantively," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
The next test for the U.A.W. will come in a vote in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama.
In addition, at least 30 percent of workers have signed cards authorizing the U.A.W. to represent them at a Hyundai plant in Alabama and a Toyota plant in Missouri, according to the union. That is the minimum needed to force an election, though the union has yet to petition for one in either location.
"People only take action when they believe there is an alternative to the status quo that has a plausible chance of winning," said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal.
Still, it's unclear how far the campaign may spread beyond German manufacturers. Volkswagen and Mercedes have been relatively friendly to unions outside the United States, and a recent German law could prompt financial penalties against companies that crack down on union organizing.
Compared with previous elections in Chattanooga, Volkswagen's pushback against the union was mild this time, according to workers. The company presented reasons it believed a union was unnecessary, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga area, but said it left the decision to the workers.
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that most Japanese and South Korean manufacturers with plants in the South would be more difficult targets for the U.A.W. because they have worked hard to develop a close relationship with workers or have butted heads with unions in their home country, or both.
The Chattanooga vote could also lead to a broader political battle over unionization within the region. Business and political leaders in the South say a greater union presence could threaten their states' economic advantages and slow down job creation.
"If we become less competitive, why not do it in Detroit?" said Gerald McCormick, a Republican who was the Tennessee House majority leader when the U.A.W. first prompted a union vote at the Volkswagen plant in 2014.
Six Republican governors highlighted those concerns in a statement on Tuesday, which said that the union campaign was "driven by misinformation and scare tactics." Opposition from state and local politicians helped defeat the union in a vote at a Nissan plant in Mississippi in 2017 and in elections at VW in Chattanooga in 2014 and 2019.
The U.A.W.'s political support for Democrats -- the union endorsed President Biden's re-election in January -- could also be a vulnerability in such a fight. Isaac Meadows, a worker at the Volkswagen plant, said in an interview in February that the endorsement had led some co-workers to have second thoughts about the union, but that he had advised them that "the political landscape changes every four to eight years and doesn't directly affect us."
Even so, a change in presidential administrations could bring a more skeptical National Labor Relations Board, which presides over union elections and enforces labor law and could make it more difficult for the union to win at other plants.
Worker advocates and union organizers acknowledged that the win in Chattanooga could trigger a strong response. "You have to imagine the backlash," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively. "My hope is that enough people understand both within the U.A.W. and within the union world writ large that you have to defend the union election."
Organizers also conceded that any momentum generated by the union victory in Chattanooga could be muted until workers there win a contract that brings concrete gains, a process that can take years.
It has been two years since Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse became the first to win a union election at the company in the United States, and they have yet to begin bargaining as the company challenges the victory. The lack of progress toward a contract appears to have complicated organizing efforts at other Amazon sites.
But the Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga have advantages that the Amazon workers lack. Unlike the Amazon Labor Union, their union is well established and can invest millions of dollars in staff and legal work to help bargain a contract. And Volkswagen appears more willing than Amazon to bargain, partly because of its labor ties in Germany.
"If workers in Chattanooga get a great contract, a big raise, better health benefits, and then the same thing at Mercedes, there will be a lot more good opportunities to win good contracts in short order," said Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries.
Ms. Janis, whose group is involved in unionizing factory workers in the South, said the momentum could travel beyond the auto industry to other manufacturers because employees at different companies in the region often know one another and discuss these issues. "Their brothers and sisters and spouses are working at other plants," she said. "It will be all over social media."
And some experts said that a rise in unionization at factories could spread to other types of jobs. "The enthusiasm is contagious across sectors," said David Pryzbylski, a lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers. "People look at it and say, 'Hey, I think there's something here. Maybe I should be interested in it, too."'
Several workers echoed the point, saying they had drawn encouragement from labor actions in other industries over the past few years. Successful campaigns in Hollywood and at companies like Starbucks and Apple "have been a major boon for us," said Emma Geiger, a worker at Sega of America who helped unionize the video game maker last year. "Especially in the perception of unions on the whole as not something to be feared, but to be embraced."
Overall, nearly 70 percent of Americans say they support unions, according to Gallup, up from about 50 percent a decade and a half ago. After dropping for several years, the number of union members increased by nearly 280,000 in 2022 and by about half that amount last year, though the percentage of workers in unions dropped slightly because even more people entered the work force. Filings for union elections were up 35 percent in the six months ending in March compared with the same period one year earlier, according to the National Labor Relations Board.
During the mid-1930s, union membership grew by several hundred thousand for three straight years, then jumped by roughly three million in 1937, most of it after the U.A.W. organized General Motors.
Another expansion on this scale is unlikely given changes in the economy, including the shift away from manufacturing as a source of jobs. But Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, which represents employers, said the past few years had produced "a lot of kindling" that could make it easier for a fire of sorts to spread.
Citing workers' frustrations over the pandemic and return-to-office policies, which they have amplified on social media, he said that "from a management perspective, it's of concern."

Workers in Tennessee Vote to Join the U.A.W.: [National Desk]

Full text: The Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga is set to become the first unionized auto factory in the South not owned by one of Detroit's Big Three.
In a landmark victory for organized labor, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee have voted overwhelmingly to join the United Automobile Workers union, becoming the first nonunion auto plant in a Southern state to do so.
The company said in a statement late Friday that the union had won 2,628 votes, with 985 opposed, in a three-day election. Two earlier bids by the U.A.W. to organize the Chattanooga factory over the last 10 years were narrowly defeated.
The outcome is a breakthrough for the labor movement in a region where anti-union sentiment has been strong for decades. And it comes six months after the U.A.W. won record wage gains and improved benefits in negotiations with the Detroit automakers.
The U.A.W. has for more than 80 years represented workers employed by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the producer of Chrysler, Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles, and has organized some heavy-truck and bus factories in the South.
But the union had failed in previous attempts to organize any of the two dozen automobile factories owned by other companies across an area stretching from South Carolina to Texas and as far north as Ohio and Indiana.
With the victory in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. will turn its focus to other Southern plants. A vote will take place in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa. The U.A.W. is hoping to organize a half-dozen or more plants over the next two years.
"Tonight you all together have taken a giant, historic step," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at a celebratory gathering in Chattanooga. "Tonight we celebrate this historic moment in our nation's and our union's history. Let's get to it and go to work and win more for the working class of this nation."
A string of victories for the U.A.W. could have profound effects for Southern auto workers and the broader auto industry. Nonunion auto workers typically earn significantly lower wages than those in U.A.W.-represented plants, and collective bargaining could bring them substantial increases in pay, benefits and job security.
"Volkswagen workers will have a chance for better pay and working conditions under a collective bargaining agreement," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "They'll have a lot of job protections under a union contract that they don't have now."
At G.M., Ford and Stellantis, any layoffs have to be planned with advance notice to the union, and workers get supplemented unemployment benefits. Nonunion plants don't have to take such measures.
A large U.A.W. presence in the South would also upset an automotive landscape in which U.A.W. contracts have left G.M., Ford and Stellantis with higher labor costs than nonunion rivals like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Tesla and Hyundai.
"This is a watershed moment for the industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It sets an example that would resonate across the industry, and across other industries where there's a large presence of nonunion workers."
The U.A.W.'s success in the negotiations with the Big Three in the fall set off a surge in interest among Southern autoworkers in organizing their own plants, the union said, and prompted the U.A.W. to kick off a $ 40 million effort to support them.
Volkswagen workers who voted in favor of U.A.W. representation said they hoped the union would help them win higher wages and more paid time off. The Chattanooga factory currently pays a top wage of about $ 35 an hour, compared with the top wage of more than $ 40 an hour that G.M., Ford and Stellantis now pay U.A.W. workers.
The U.A.W. contracts also provide health care coverage that is almost entirely paid by the companies, substantial profit-sharing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments to insulate workers from inflation and generous retirement programs.
Among those voting for the U.A.W. in Chattanooga was Tony Akridge, 48, who is in his second year at the VW plant, working on motors and transmissions on the night shift. His $ 23 hourly wage exceeded what he earned in previous jobs, he said, but he voted for the U.A.W. in hopes that the union could help improve workers' living standards.
"It gives us a better opportunity," Mr. Akridge said. "They pay us OK, but it's not good enough for the things they need done. Noting the rising cost of living, he added that the union "will get better benefits toward that, making life just a little bit more easy."
Others are counting on U.A.W. representation to bring more paid time off. Most VW workers must either take unpaid time off when the plant shuts down in the summer and around the holidays, or use paid time off to cover those periods. If they do, many are left with only a few days to cover any sick days or family leave the rest of the year, workers said.
"We're forced to use our P.T.O. a lot instead of using it on our own terms sometimes," said Craig Jackson, 56, who voted for the union.
At the Detroit automakers, U.A.W. workers get up to five weeks of vacation and 19 paid holidays, and are allowed two weeks for parental leave.
Workers who opposed the union at VW said they were unsure what gains the U.A.W. could bring them.
"You really don't have any kind of guarantee with them," said Darrell Belcher, 54, who has worked on the assembly floor for 13 years and voted against the U.A.W. in the two previous elections at the plant. "I'm not saying we won't gain anything, but we are probably going to lose something just to gain it."
As the voting was about to start, the governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas -- all Republicans -- issued a statement on Tuesday saying unionizing would jeopardize auto jobs in their states.
"We want to keep good-paying jobs and continue to grow the American auto manufacturing sector here," the governors said. "A successful unionization drive will stop this growth in its tracks, to the detriment of American workers."
But even some VW workers who opposed the U.A.W. said they did not think union representation would endanger the Chattanooga plant. "I do not feel that the plant will leave Chattanooga or the South," said Cody Rose, 34, a 13-year veteran of the plant who works in body shop production. "Volkswagen has too much invested in this area."
The Chattanooga plant opened in 2011, and employs 5,500 people, of whom about 4,300 were eligible to vote in the union election. The plant produces the VW Atlas, a large sport utility vehicle, and an electric vehicle, the ID.4. It is Volkswagen's only plant in the United States, and was the only VW plant in the world that was not unionized.
The U.A.W. had some advantages in winning support at Volkswagen. Its effort had the support of IG Metall, the powerful union that represents autoworkers in Germany. German companies also have a strong tradition of giving workers a voice. Under German law, worker representatives must hold half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of a board of directors.
The U.A.W. can now turn its attention to the Mercedes plant in Alabama, which employs about 6,100 people. The union tried to organize that plant once before, but the effort died out before coming to a vote.

Google Fires 28 Workers
For Israeli Contract Sit-In
Google fired 28 employees on Wednesday after dozens of employees participated in sit-ins at the company's New York and Sunnyvale, Calif., offices to protest the company's cloud computing contract with the Israeli government.
A day earlier, nine employees were arrested on charges of trespassing at the two offices.
"Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement.
Years before the dismissals, tensions had been simmering between the company's management and some activist employees over Project Nimbus, a $ 1.2 billion Google and Amazon deal to supply the Israeli government with cloud services, such as artificial intelligence. Some Google employees have expressed concern that the company was aiding Israel's military.
That discord had deepened since the war in Gaza began in October. Google recently fired an employee who disrupted an Israeli technology conference in New York. And the company is even planning to make changes to a corporate forum because employees were bickering about the conflict.
Google said it would continue to investigate the Tuesday protests. In Sunnyvale, employees refused to leave the office of Thomas Kurian, the chief executive of Google Cloud.
Google employees affiliated with the group that organized the sit-ins, called No Tech for Apartheid, said in a statement that the firings were "a flagrant act of retaliation."
"Google workers have the right to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our labor," the employees said. They added that some of the employees Google fired had not participated in the sit-ins.

Alabama Auto Workers
To Vote on Unionizing
Thousands of workers at a big Mercedes-Benz factory near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will vote next month on whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers union.
The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that the vote will take place from May 13 to May 17 at the facilities in Vance and Woodstock, Ala. Votes will be counted by the agency on May 17.
The vote will be the second in the union's drive to organize 150,000 workers at more than a dozen nonunion auto manufacturing plants largely in Southern states. About 4,300 workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., are voting on union representation this week, with the vote tally to be announced on Friday.
The organizing effort comes after the union won big pay raises after workers struck Detroit's three automakers last fall.
The Mercedes facilities had about 6,100 employees as of the end of 2023. More than 5,000 are calling for the union vote, the union has said.
Earlier this week the governors of six Southern states, including Alabama and Tennessee, put out a statement saying that workers will put their jobs in jeopardy if they vote for a union.

Voting Tests Union's Push At VW Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers hopes contract gains at the Big Three carmakers will provide momentum in a broad effort to organize nonunion plants.
Last fall the United Automobile Workers union won big pay increases from the Detroit automakers, and the impact rippled quickly through the nonunion auto plants scattered across the South.
Afterward, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai and Tesla raised wages for their own hourly workers in the United States, none of whom are unionized. On production lines in Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and elsewhere, those pay increases have been referred to as the "U.A.W. bump."
Now 4,300 workers at Volkswagen's plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., will test whether the union can achieve an even greater bump. On Wednesday, they began voting on whether to join the U.A.W., and the prospects of a union victory appear high. About 70 percent of the workers pledged to vote yes before the union asked for a vote, according to the U.A.W.
"I think our chances are excellent," said Kelcey Smith, 48, who has worked in the VW plant's paint department for a year and is a member of a committee working to build support for the U.A.W. "The energy is high. I think we are going to nail it."
Volkswagen has presented reasons it believes a union is not needed at the plant, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga region. But it has also said it encourages all workers to vote in the election, which is to conclude on Friday, and decide for themselves. "No one will lose their job for voting for or against the union," a company spokesman said.
The stakes go beyond the Tennessee plant, Volkswagen's only U.S. factory. A victory there would add fuel to the U.A.W.'s push to extend its presence to the more than two dozen nonunion auto plants in the United States, mostly clustered in Southern states where union resistance has been strong historically, and where right-to-work laws make it hard for unions to organize workers.
The U.A.W.'s chances beyond the Volkswagen factory are unclear. Japanese and South Korean automakers have demonstrated more forceful opposition to the U.A.W. than the German companies. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has spoken out against the U.A.W. on several occasions over the last few years.
And on Tuesday, the Republican governors of six states -- Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas -- denounced the U.A.W. drive, saying in a statement that they were "highly concerned about the unionization campaign driven by misinformation and scare tactics that the U.A.W. has brought into our states."
"We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states," the governors declared. "These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy."
The vote at VW will be followed by another election -- as yet unscheduled -- at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., where the U.A.W. says a majority of workers have signed up to back the union.
The U.A.W. says victories at VW, Mercedes and other plants would bring increased wages, richer benefits and higher living standards for tens of thousands of workers, many of them in the nation's poorer counties.
Widespread unionizing in the Southern plants would also help level a playing field that for nearly half a century has been tilted against the three unionized Detroit manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler. In operating nonunion factories, foreign-owned companies have a significant labor-cost advantage over their U.S.-based rivals.
"It would be a revolution for the U.A.W. and for the auto industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It would break the glass ceiling for unions in the South, and would mean more purchasing power for working-class people in that region."
The U.A.W. has organized several heavy-truck and bus plants in the South, but for decades has tried and failed to do the same at automobile factories, which are typically larger.
The VW election is the union's third try at the plant. Workers rejected U.A.W. representation by a vote of 712 to 626 in 2014, and by an even narrower margin, 833 to 776, in 2019. Opposition from Republican elected officials in Tennessee was vociferous in those campaigns.
In the last 10 years, the U.A.W. also lost in a 2017 vote at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., and an organizing drive at the Mercedes plant fizzled without an election.
In those efforts, the U.A.W. was hampered by a dubious track record and a questionable reputation. Over nearly 30 years, the Detroit automakers closed dozens of plants, eliminating tens of thousands of hourly jobs, despite the U.A.W.'s objections. Some industry executives have blamed high union wages, in part, for pushing G.M. and Chrysler into bankruptcy in 2009. In addition, the union was racked by corruption scandals that resulted in prison sentences for two former presidents and about a dozen other senior U.A.W. officials.
In the past two years, however, the U.A.W. has undergone a transformation. Financial reforms and transparency measures overseen by a federal monitor have helped root out corruption. A feisty president, Shawn Fain, was chosen in the union's first direct election by the membership. In the contract negotiations last year with G.M., Ford and Stellantis, Mr. Fain used a new approach, choosing all three companies as strike targets but shutting down only selected plants, which put pressure on the companies without crippling them or damaging the broader U.S. economy.
After six weeks, the union had contracts raising the top wage 25 percent, to more than $ 40 an hour. Pay for workers lower on the wage scale will rise to the top wage over three years instead of eight. Some will see their pay double. A worker putting in 40 hours a week at the top wage will earn about $ 83,000 a year. In recent years, profit-sharing bonuses have added about $ 9,000 to $ 14,000.
On top of that, the new contracts provide wage adjustments if inflation pushes the cost of living higher, improved pensions and retirement benefits, and increased paid time off. U.A.W. workers have also long had company-paid health care with no deductibles or co-payments.
Hourly wages at the nonunion auto plants used to start under $ 20 and top out around $ 32. The "U.A.W. bump" lifted the range to roughly $ 22 to $ 35. Volkswagen said its workers typically earned about $ 60,000 a year. (The annual mean wage for all occupations in the Chattanooga area was $ 54,480 in May, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
Seizing on momentum from the Big Three negotiations, Mr. Fain said, the union will spend $ 40 million through 2026 to support organizing at plants owned by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda, Volvo and Tesla, as well as others owned by the electric vehicle start-ups Rivian and Lucid Motors.
VW workers who support the U.A.W. say their wages are pretty good for Tennessee but point 300 miles north to Louisville, Ky., where Ford pays many workers more than $ 40 an hour to make the Expedition sport utility vehicle, which competes with the VW Atlas made in Chattanooga.
"If Ford can pay that much, why can't Volkswagen pay us the same?" said Isaac Meadows, 40, a father of six who has worked at the VW plant for 14 months. "We have more worth than they're paying us."
There are concerns beyond the hourly wage. Workers must use paid time off if they want to be paid during two periods when the plant shuts down around the year-end holidays and in summer.
Once he covers the shutdowns with vacation days, Mr. Meadows said, he is left with about 16 hours of paid time off to cover any family events or sick days for the rest of the year. "I miss my kids' dances, sporting events, family gatherings," he said. "I miss a lot because I've got to work."

Court Papers Hold Clues to Menendez's Defense in Bribery Case: He May Blame His Wife: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: According to newly unsealed documents, Senator Robert Menendez may testify that Nadine Menendez hid information from him, leading him to believe that "nothing unlawful was taking place."
Senator Robert Menendez may blame his wife, Nadine Menendez, for the bribery charges the couple is facing by claiming that she hid information from him and led him to believe that "nothing unlawful was taking place," according to court papers unsealed on Tuesday.
The revelation was contained in two sentences in a legal brief filed by Mr. Menendez's lawyers. They had asked a judge to keep the information secret because it detailed trial strategy that, if made public, would "surely garner significant media attention" and "bias the jury pool."
The new insight into Mr. Menendez's defense comes just three weeks before he and two New Jersey businessmen are scheduled to go on trial in Manhattan, accused of participating in a wide-ranging corruption scheme. Ms. Menendez's trial date was postponed to July after her lawyers told the judge she had a "serious medical condition" that would require surgery and a potentially extended period of treatment and recovery.
The senator and his wife are accused of accepting cash, gold and a luxury car in exchange for Mr. Menendez's willingness to use his political influence to help allies in New Jersey and to aid the governments of Egypt and Qatar. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
According to the newly unsealed section of the brief, Mr. Menendez may testify at his trial and, if he does, he would disclose communications with Ms. Menendez that would "tend to exonerate" him but may incriminate his wife.
The unsealing was ordered by a judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, at the request of a coalition of news organizations.
Ms. Menendez's lawyers said they had no comment on the senator's apparent defense strategy.
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, also declined to comment.
The legal brief that contained the peek into trial strategy was originally filed in January under seal, with a redacted version posted on the public docket. The two sentences in Mr. Menendez's brief remained redacted until the judge's order on Tuesday.
The issue of Mr. Menendez's legal strategy first arose at a time when the senator and his wife were each asking the judge for separate trials because of the complications posed by a married couple's being tried together.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers argued that to try them together "threatens the senator's right to a fair trial by, among other things, forcing him to choose between two fundamental rights: his right to testify in his own defense and his right not to testify against his spouse."
For months, Mr. Menendez's lawyers have strongly suggested that they planned to claim that the senator was duped by his wife. In a portion of the January legal brief that was not redacted, they noted that the senator "lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife."
"By this defense," the lawyers wrote, they "may have to argue, in effect, that any unlawful conduct -- and we are aware of none -- involved the actions of others (including Nadine), not the senator."
If Mr. Menendez chooses to testify, his lawyers wrote, he is likely to explain, for example, what he and his wife discussed during the dinners prosecutors say she arranged with Egyptian officials. He might also disclose the explanations that Ms. Menendez gave him about why two other defendants "provided her certain monetary items," they wrote.
In the newly unredacted portions of the brief, Mr. Menendez's lawyers add that while these explanations, and the marital communications on which they rely, "will tend to exonerate Senator Menendez by demonstrating the absence of any improper intent on Senator Menendez's part, they may inculpate Nadine by demonstrating the ways in which she withheld information from Senator Menendez or otherwise led him to believe that nothing unlawful was taking place."
Ms. Menendez, 57, and Mr. Menendez, 70, married in 2020. Prosecutors have said that the bribery conspiracy at the core of the criminal charges originated in February 2018, soon after they began dating.
Ms. Menendez, according to a federal indictment, played a central role in the conspiracy. Prosecutors said she served as a go-between who transferred messages between her husband, their co-defendants and Egyptian officials. Several of the alleged bribes -- a Mercedes-Benz convertible, mortgage payments and a low- or no-show job -- were provided to Ms. Menendez.
Earlier on Tuesday, prosecutors asked Judge Stein to delay the senator's trial, currently scheduled for May 6, explaining that negotiations with defense lawyers had broken down over a particular pretrial issue. If the conflict is not resolved, the prosecutors said, one co-defendant, Wael Hana, will have to retain a new lawyer.
Mr. Hana's lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, and Mr. Menendez's lawyers, Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, each responded in letters to the judge, rejecting the government's assertion that there was an impasse. Mr. Fee and Mr. Weitzman argued that prosecutors had "manufactured" the dispute.
Judge Stein said he would hold a hearing on Wednesday to discuss the disagreement and the timing of the trial.

Germany's Leader Walks a Fine Line in Visit to China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to promote German business interests while delivering warnings from Europe about trade and geopolitical tensions.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany tried to strike a delicate balance on a trip to China this week, promoting business ties with his country's biggest trading partner while raising concerns over its surge of exports to Europe and its support for Russia.
Mr. Scholz met with China's top leader, Xi Jinping, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Tuesday, the culmination of a three-day visit with a delegation of German officials and business leaders. He also met with Premier Li Qiang as the two countries navigate relations strained by Russia's war in Ukraine and China's rivalry with the United States, Germany's most important ally.
Throughout his trip, Mr. Scholz promoted the interests of German companies that are finding it increasingly hard to compete in China. And he conveyed growing concern in the European Union that the region's market is becoming a dumping ground for Chinese goods produced at a loss.
But Mr. Scholz chose a conciliatory tone over a combative one in his opening remarks before sitting down with Mr. Xi on Tuesday morning, in a meeting that stretched over three hours and turned into a walk and lunch.
It was the German leader's first visit to China since his government adopted a strategy last year that defined the Asian power as a "partner, competitor and systemic rival," calling on Germany to reduce its dependency on Chinese goods.
Germany's economy shrank last year, and its weaknesses have exposed a reliance on China for growth. Energy prices have risen because of the war in Ukraine, which has been facilitated by Beijing's support for the Kremlin. German companies have pushed for more access to China and complained that they face unfair competition.
The chancellor visited German companies with extensive investments in China and met with trade representatives and officials in the sprawling industrial metropolis of Chongqing in China's southwest and in Shanghai and Beijing.
At a talk with a group of students in Shanghai on Monday, Mr. Scholz fielded a question from a student who planned to study in Germany this year, who said he was "really worried" because the country had partially legalized cannabis. "When you study in Berlin, you can run around the whole time and never meet anyone who does that," the chancellor assured him.
But he also used the platform to push more serious messages about trade. "Competition must be fair," Mr. Scholz told the students. "We want a level playing field," he said.
Mr. Scholz's trip was an example of the difficult dance that Germany is trying to do: maintaining economic ties with China while managing U.S. pressure to align itself more closely with Washington against Beijing.
In his meetings, Mr. Scholz highlighted Germany's commitment to doing business with China, but he also warned that Beijing had to curb the flood of Chinese goods into Europe. At the same time, he expressed reservations about the European Union's investigations into China's use of subsidies for green technology industries, saying that any discussion about trade must be based on fairness.
"This must be done from a position of self-confident competitiveness and not from protectionist motives," Mr. Scholz told reporters on Monday.
China's manufacturing push in green sectors like electric cars and solar panels has touched off trade disputes with Europe and the United States, where such industries have also received government support. But with 5,000 German companies active in the Chinese market, Germany stands to lose more than many of its European partners would if Beijing were to retaliate against the European Union.
"If the E.U. goes too hard against China, we could expect countermeasures and this would be a catastrophe for us," said Maximilian Butek, the executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in China.
"For us it's extremely important that the Chinese market remains open," he said.
In his meeting with Mr. Xi, Mr. Scholz indicated that Russia's war on Ukraine and its arms buildup were high on his agenda. "They directly affect our core interests. Indirectly, they damage the entire international order," he said in opening remarks at the meeting, a transcript of which was provided by Mr. Scholz's office.
Despite pressing the issue with Mr. Xi, he did not appear to win the commitment that he had sought from the Chinese leader to take part in an international conference for Ukraine planned in June. Germany had hoped that China could use its influence over Russia to help work toward a peace agreement.
Germany would also like China stop selling goods to Russia that have potential uses on the battlefield, and Mr. Scholz told reporters that he had brought up the issue in his meeting. "The point has been made," he said. "There can be no misunderstanding about how we see things."
China is hoping to drive a wedge between Europe and the United States by courting leaders such as Mr. Scholz. State media reports depicted his visit as demonstrating the strength of China's relations with Europe, playing up its economic ties with Germany.
In his opening remarks to Mr. Scholz, Mr. Xi said cooperation between China and Germany, which have the second- and third-largest economies, was beneficial to the world, a remark that could be read as directed at those who have urged Berlin to distance itself from Beijing.
"The two countries should view and develop bilateral relations from a long-term and strategic perspective and work together to inject more stability and certainty into the world," Mr. Xi told Mr. Scholz, emphasizing the importance of seeking "common ground."
Beijing is sure to welcome the message that German businesses are committed to China. The Asian giant is trying to court foreign investment to reinvigorate its economy, which has faltered because of a housing slowdown. Some Western businesses and investors have also been rattled by Mr. Xi's emphasis on national security, which they regard as making it riskier to operate in the country.
From China's perspective, Germany may be its best hope of delaying or watering down any trade restrictions from Europe, said Noah Barkin, a senior adviser in the China practice at the Rhodium Group, a research firm.
German carmakers have invested billions of dollars in China, and much of their revenue comes from there. Many worry that if the European Commission imposes higher tariffs on Chinese exports, and Beijing retaliates, German businesses will suffer most.
Chinese officials "know that German companies are heavily invested and they use that politically to influence political decision making in Berlin," Mr. Barkin said.
Germany's biggest companies, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and BASF, have large operations in China and strong, effective lobbies in Berlin, Mr. Barkin added. Executives from those companies, along with several others, traveled with Mr. Scholz to China.
"The supply chain in China is stuffed with German goods," said Joerg Wuttke, a former president of the E.U. Chamber of Commerce in China. "If China has a price war with Germany, then no one will make money anymore."
Mr. Scholz also brought along the German ministers for agriculture, the environment and transportation, officials who experts said would be particularly interested in working with China.
"You set an agenda with these three ministers, the tonality is overall a cooperative one, these are areas that we want to work on," said Janka Oertel, director of the Asia Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Chinese officials, for their part, have brushed off the European accusations of unfair trading practices, calling them groundless and an act of "typical protectionism." They have hinted that they could retaliate for any actions taken by the European Union, saying that China was "strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes" its investigations.
In an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Wu Ken, China's ambassador to Germany, said the competitive edge of Chinese electric vehicles "relies on innovation, not subsidies."
"The challenge faced by developed countries lies more in the fact that Chinese companies are more efficient," the ambassador said.

Full text: China remains one of the most important markets for Germany's export-driven economy, prompting a three-day visit by the German chancellor, who has stressed the importance of open markets.
When Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, took office in 2021, he pledged that his government would shift his country's relationship with China away from one of economic dependence. Three years later, talk of scaling back reliance on China has been replaced with calls for equal access to China's market for foreign firms.
That strategy puts the Germans at odds with many of their closest allies, including the United States and other European countries, which would like to see China scale back its recent surge of exports in the green energy sector, including electric vehicles. The U.S. Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, has talked about imposing trade restrictions on China.
The chief executives of several leading multinational companies based in Germany joined Mr. Scholz on his three-day tour of China, which included a meeting with Xi Jinping, China's top leader, in Beijing on Tuesday. All of the company leaders oversee large operations in China that they are eager not only to maintain, but in many cases to expand.
That leaves Mr. Scholz facing the delicate act of balancing the export-oriented needs of his domestic economy with pressure from allies to leverage his country's position to make demands on the Chinese.
How deep is the relationship between Germany and China?
German companies invested 10.4 billion euros, or $ 11 billion, in China last year and, unlike their counterparts in Japan and the United States, they have showed little sign of waning.
Some analysts see this as proof of German strength in its position to push its agenda with Chinese leaders.
"Germany plays an exceptionally special role for China in the development of its economy and also in foreign trade relations," said Max J. Zenglein, chief economist at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. Electronics and electronic technology, along with machines and chemicals, remain important exports from Germany to China.
"As countries such as the U.S.A. and Japan are positioning themselves much more sharply in relation to China, Germany has an important function when it comes to access to technology and capital," he said. "Germany is definitely in a position of strength here."
How are German companies faring in China?
About 5,000 German companies are active in China. But in a recent survey of 150 members of the German Chamber of Commerce in Greater China, two-thirds said they felt they faced unfair competition in the country.
German companies believe their products offer superior quality, innovation and technical leadership compared with those made by their Chinese competitors. But increasingly limited access to government officials and regulators have the Germans concerned they will lose out on business that is key to their global success.
Mr. Scholz highlighted the role that German companies have played in helping China to grow its economy, in remarks released by the chancellor's office ahead of his meeting with Mr. Xi on Tuesday.
"In the past two days, together with a business delegation, I have visited Chongqing and Shanghai and been impressed with how German companies contribute to growth, innovation and sustainability in China," Mr. Scholz said.
What about fears of Chinese goods flooding Germany?
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, expressed concerns last week that Europe remained the last market that was fully open to China. Last fall, the European Union opened an investigation into whether electric vehicles made in China benefited from unfair subsidies, with a decision expected by this summer. She cited Brazil, Turkey and the United States as countries that were pursuing steps that could lead to trade restrictions on Chinese products.
Among the executives traveling with Mr. Scholz were the heads of BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- Volkswagen's chief executive pulled out at the last minute, citing a conflict. All three of Germany's main automakers are heavily invested in China and appear intent on remaining competitive in the market.
"China is the largest automobile market in the world. We are a leading luxury auto maker and we have grown strongly in China and have a strong presence," Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, said in comments to German public broadcaster ARD. "Withdrawing from such a large market is not an option, on the contrary, we are expanding our position here."
Representatives of the German auto industry point out that thousands of jobs in Germany depend on the revenue generated in the Chinese market. German auto makers increasingly rely on teams in China for research and development in fields such as automated driving that are not as advanced in Europe.
During the trip, ministers from both countries signed an agreement to work toward the standardization of autonomous driving technology.
"Our guiding principle should always be free trade and competition" Oliver Zipse, chairman of BMW said, naming Japan, Korea and other countries who sell their cars in Europe. "We do not feel threatened by Chinese automakers."

Tesla Plans To Lay Off Over 10% Of Workers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Along with the departure of two senior executives, the cuts added to signs of turmoil at the electric car company.
Signs of turmoil at Tesla multiplied on Monday after the electric car company told employees it would lay off more than 10 percent of the work force to cut costs and two senior executives resigned.
The job cuts, amounting to about 14,000 people, come as the company faces increasing competition and declining sales. The management changes and layoffs are a reminder of the unpredictability of Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, at a critical time for the company.
Mr. Musk has not outlined a plan to reverse a decline in car sales, and he appears focused on long-shot ventures such as a self-driving taxi, rather than new models that would help Tesla compete with cars being introduced by established carmakers and new rivals from China.
"As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity," Mr. Musk told employees in a Monday morning email, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
"There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done," he wrote.
Hours after that email, Drew Baglino, a senior vice president who has played a big role in the company's rise from start-up to dominant electric car maker, said he had resigned.
"I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday," Mr. Baglino said in a post on X, the social media site. Mr. Baglino is one of only three managers besides Mr. Musk listed as a top executive on the company's website. His longevity was unusual at a company known for high management turnover.
Mr. Baglino may have been blamed for some of Tesla's recent troubles, said Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm. "Someone has to take the fall for the sharp deceleration in deliveries growth, near record inventories, and declining margins and it wasn't going to be Elon," Mr. Black said on X.
Tesla also appeared to be losing an executive key to winning regulatory approval for self-driving technology. Rohan Patel, a former aide to President Barack Obama who was Tesla's head of policy and business development, tacitly confirmed reports that he was leaving. In a post on X, Mr. Patel thanked his co-workers and Mr. Musk for "the past eight years at Tesla."
"My plans are to be a recess monitor for my second grade daughter, practice my violin, go to a bunch of bucket list sporting events and take my very patient wife on some long intended travel," Mr. Patel said.
Investors often welcome job cuts because they can lead to higher profits. But that was not the case Monday, with Tesla shares ending the day down more than 5 percent.
Tesla regularly culls its work force to remove employees whose performance managers consider weak, but the numbers are typically smaller. "This is something Elon and Tesla have consistently done throughout his career," said Scott Acheychek, chief executive of REX Shares, which offers funds investors use to bet on or against Tesla's stock. "Ten percent is pretty big," Mr. Acheychek added.
Mr. Musk's email to employees was earlier reported by Electrek, an online news site, and Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper.
Mr. Musk did not indicate where the cuts would be made. Many of Tesla's workers are based at four large car factories in Fremont, Calif., Austin, Texas, and Shanghai and near Berlin. Tesla also has a factory in Buffalo that produces charging equipment and a factory near Reno, Nev., that makes batteries.
The layoffs may help the United Automobile Workers union's efforts to organize Tesla employees in the United States. The company's workers may be more open to the union if they believe that representation would give them greater job security. Workers at a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee will vote this week on joining the U.A.W., and Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama will vote next month.
Mr. Musk's many other ventures, and his penchant for making polarizing political statements, have raised questions about his focus on managing Tesla. Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the company: Tesla's share price has lost about one-third of its value this year.
Many investors had expressed hope that Tesla would revive flagging sales by introducing a car that would sell for about $ 25,000 as early as next year, increasing the number of people who could afford the company's cars and responding to competition from Chinese companies that are already selling electric cars for as little as half that price tag.
Mr. Musk cast doubt on those plans by announcing this month that Tesla would unveil a Robotaxi in August. The self-driving taxi is seen as a long shot, in part because even the most advanced systems available today sometimes make glaring mistakes. In addition, federal and state regulators will have to sign off before Tesla can put such taxis on the road.
This month, Tesla reported a decline in sales that caught investors off guard. The company said it delivered 387,000 cars worldwide in the first quarter, down 8.5 percent from the year before. It was the first time Tesla's quarterly sales had fallen on a year over year basis since the start of the pandemic in 2020.
The company slashed prices significantly over the course of 2023 to increase demand, which has reduced the profit Tesla makes on each car. Last week, Tesla reduced the price of its most advanced driver-assistance software to $ 99 a month from $ 199. But price cuts appear to be losing their effectiveness. Tesla will announce its financial results for the first quarter on April 23.
Rivals like BYD of China, BMW of Germany, and Kia and Hyundai Motor of South Korea reported increases in electric vehicle sales for the same period, suggesting that slower overall demand for battery-powered models was not the only explanation for Tesla's problems.
Established companies are closing the gap with Tesla on battery technology, and have been building new assembly lines to achieve the cost savings made possible by mass production. Honda plans to begin producing electric vehicles at a factory in Marysville, Ohio, next year.
Hyundai will begin producing electric cars at a new factory in Georgia in October, José Muñoz, the president and global chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor, said in an interview last month. Hyundai will also begin allowing customers to buy cars on Amazon, an answer to Tesla's practice of selling cars online.
Mr. Muñoz said that customers had been willing to pay more for Hyundai electric cars than they would for comparable Teslas. "At the beginning, Tesla was premium," he said. "Now we're premium."

New Jersey Senator and His Wife Will Have Separate Trials in Bribery Case: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nadine Menendez had alerted the court to a health issue and requested a postponement. On Thursday, a judge said Robert Menendez's case would proceed as scheduled. His wife's trial will be delayed.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and his wife, Nadine Menendez, will be tried separately in a federal bribery case, a Manhattan judge ruled on Thursday.
The trial of Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, will go forward as scheduled on May 6, but Ms. Menendez's case will be delayed until the summer.
The judge, Sidney H. Stein, issued his ruling after Ms. Menendez's lawyers told him that she had a "serious medical condition" that would require surgery and a potentially extended period of treatment and recovery.
Neither of the Menendezes were in court on Thursday. Before the judge issued his ruling, Adam Fee, one of the senator's lawyers, urged him to keep the May 6 trial date.
"Every day that the specter of the unproven allegations are in the air as to our client is a detriment to him," Mr. Fee said, arguing that a postponement could effectively hamper his ability to run in a general election.
"Every day of delay is prejudicial to him," Mr. Fee added.
Ms. Menendez's lawyers had asked the judge to postpone the trial for her alone because of her health issue. While federal prosecutors said they did not oppose a delay until the summer, they asked that the judge not try the Menendezes separately because that would mean holding two lengthy trials.
"The government expects that if this case were tried twice," the prosecutors wrote to the judge on Wednesday, "it would have to present the same or substantially the same case, in full, a second time. That means picking a jury, a second time, and doing so after the case has already been tried once and a verdict has been returned."
But Judge Stein said that given Ms. Menendez's medical issues, he would sever her trial from her husband's. "The court will have to try this case twice," the judge said.
"We are grateful that the court recognized that Senator Menendez's wife needs time to focus on her health," Mr. Fee said in a statement after the hearing. "Senator Menendez is looking forward to trial and proving that these charges lack merit and the prosecutors should never have brought them."
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to comment on the judge's ruling.
Judge Stein set a July 8 trial date for Ms. Menendez, 57, but he said he would hold a conference in June to determine whether that date was realistic.
Ms. Menendez's lawyers first disclosed her health situation on Tuesday in a two-page letter to the judge. They said she had recently been diagnosed with a condition that would require surgery in four to six weeks and "possibly significant follow-up and recovery treatment."
"Given her medical circumstances," the lawyers wrote, "Ms. Menendez is not able to assist her counsel in preparing for trial in the next four weeks."
They did not publicly reveal the nature of her illness, but provided details to the judge in a filing under seal to protect her privacy.
The latest ruling comes several weeks after Mr. Menendez said he would forgo running for re-election in a June Democratic primary, noting that the criminal charges he faced would preclude a meaningful discussion of policy issues. Mr. Menendez, 70, said he expected to prove at trial that he was not guilty, leaving the door open for a possible run for re-election as an independent in November.
The Menendezes have been charged with accepting cash, gold bars and a luxury convertible in exchange for the senator's willingness to use his political influence at home and on behalf of the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Two New Jersey businessmen have also been charged in the case. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Ms. Menendez was a central figure in the bribe scheme, according to prosecutors. And several of the bribes went directly to her, including a new Mercedes-Benz, a low- or no-show job and mortgage payments on her house, the indictment charged.
It was unclear on Thursday what effect the decision to hold two trials would have on the defense strategies of the senator and his wife. Mr. Menendez's lawyers said in a January court filing that they intended to argue that the senator "lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine," and had not agreed to join any of the conspiracies charged in the indictment.
"By this defense," the lawyers said, they "may have to argue, in effect, that any unlawful conduct -- and we are aware of none -- involved the actions of others (including Nadine), not the senator."
At the hearing on Thursday, the judge also denied a series of motions by the defendants, including one in which Mr. Menendez's lawyers asked that his trial be moved to New Jersey where, they wrote, the "overwhelming bulk" of the conduct charged in the indictment occurred. "This case belongs in New Jersey," they said.
Judge Stein also said he would give Ms. Menendez a month to find new counsel after Danny Onorato and David Schertler, the Washington-based lawyers who have represented her since the start of the investigation, asked last week to withdraw from the case. They gave no public reason, elaborating only in a sealed letter to the judge. But prosecutors were expected to call at least one of Ms. Menendez's lawyers to testify in an effort to prove she obstructed justice during the government's investigation.
If the lawyers testified, that would leave them unable to also defend her, Judge Stein told Ms. Menendez at a hearing last month. "A lawyer cannot be both a fact witness and a lawyer for one of the parties," the judge explained. "That's a conflict."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ms. Menendez, the wife of Senator Robert Menendez, needs surgery, leaving her unable to prepare for a May 6 trial on bribery charges, her lawyers said.
Nadine Menendez, the wife of Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, asked a judge on Tuesday to delay her trial on bribery charges because of what her lawyers described as a "serious medical condition" that will require surgery and an extended recovery period.
Ms. Menendez, 57, did not publicly disclose the nature of the medical issue but indicated that she received a recent diagnosis for a condition that will require surgery within four to six weeks and potentially significant follow-up treatment. Ms. Menendez's lawyers, in a two-page letter to the judge, said they were providing further details in a separate submission that was filed under seal to protect Ms. Menendez's privacy.
"Given her medical circumstances, Ms. Menendez is not able to assist her counsel in preparing for trial in the next four weeks," her lawyers wrote to Judge Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court in Manhattan. The trial of Ms. Menendez, her husband and two New Jersey businessmen is scheduled to start on May 6, but her lawyers said she would not be in "physical or psychological condition" to participate.
The judge could grant a delay to Ms. Menendez but order the senator and the businessmen to go to trial as planned next month. The Menendezes have each asked the judge for separate trials, a request the judge has yet to rule on.
Ms. Menendez's request for a delay adds to an already complicated array of legal issues to be decided before the couple stands trial on what prosecutors have described as a wide-ranging international bribery conspiracy. They are charged with accepting cash, gold bars and a luxury convertible in exchange for the senator's willingness to use his political influence at home and on behalf of the governments of Egypt and Qatar. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.
On Friday, Ms. Menendez's lawyers asked to be removed from the case for an undisclosed reason. Prosecutors had indicated that they were likely to call her lawyers to testify at the trial in an apparent effort to prove that Ms. Menendez obstructed justice during the government's investigation. Judge Stein had made it clear that Ms. Menendez's lawyers would not be permitted to both defend her and to testify, and he had encouraged the parties to try to reach a compromise. The judge has not yet acted on the lawyers' request to withdraw from the case.
The disclosure of Ms. Menendez's health trouble and her request for a postponement also comes weeks after the senator publicly indicated that he was eager to get the trial underway.
Mr. Menendez has bowed out of the state's Democratic primary but said that he hoped to run for re-election in November as an independent if he was exonerated, as he said he expected to be. He also declined to pursue an immediate appeal of a recent ruling by Judge Stein not to dismiss the charges against him, with his lawyers telling the judge that the senator's decision was "principally motivated by his desire to proceed to trial and establish his innocence without further delay."
Judge Stein had ordered a hearing on Thursday to rule on pending motions in the case, and he could take up the matter of Ms. Menendez's request for a postponement at that time.
Among the requests awaiting action by the judge are the motions by Mr. and Ms. Menendez for separate trials -- a request the government opposes. Mr. Menendez's lawyers have argued that trying them together "threatens the senator's right to a fair trial by, among other things, forcing him to choose between two fundamental rights: his right to testify in his own defense and his right not to testify against his spouse."
But if the judge refuses to grant separate trials, a postponement for Ms. Menendez would seemingly require a delay of Mr. Menendez's trial as well.
Lawyers for Mr. Menendez did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Menendez's request for a trial delay. Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment.
Writing to Judge Stein on Tuesday, Ms. Menendez's lawyers asked for a hearing in two months for their client to provide the court with an update on her medical condition and treatment plan and "a feasible timetable for rescheduling her trial date."
Ms. Menendez, the mother of two adult children, married Mr. Menendez in 2020 after a yearlong engagement. Prosecutors have depicted her as a key figure in the alleged bribery conspiracy. Several of the bribes, according to the indictment, were provided to Ms. Menendez, including a new Mercedes-Benz convertible, a low- or no-show job and mortgage payments on her house, which was facing foreclosure.
She and Mr. Menendez continue to live in the house in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. Investigators who searched the home in June 2022 found $ 486,000 in cash and 13 bars of gold bullion.

Mercedes Plant Is Calling For Vote to Join U.A.W.
A majority of workers at a Mercedes-Benz plant located near Tuscaloosa, Ala., are calling for a vote to join the United Auto Workers union, which is on a push to sign up nonunion plants across the country.
According to a Friday announcement from the U.A.W., the workers have filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for the vote.
Their call for a union election arrives just weeks after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., set a date to vote for U.A.W. representation.
The Mercedes plant in Vance, Ala., had a total of about 6,100 employees as of the end of 2023. More than 5,000 are calling for the union vote, U.A.W. said Friday.
"We are voting for safer jobs at Mercedes," Moesha Chandler, an assembly team member at Mercedes, said in a statement shared in union's announcement. "When you're still in your 20s and your body is breaking down, that's not right. By winning our union, we'll have the power to make the work safer and more sustainable."
No date for the plant's union vote has been set yet, but the U.A.W. said that the Mercedes workers hope to vote by early May.
In response to the petition, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International said it "fully respects our Team Members' choice," on whether to unionize. ASSOCIATED PRESS

J.&J., in $ 13 Billion Deal, Adds to MedTech Business
Johnson & Johnson is pumping more money into heart care with a roughly $ 13 billion deal for Shockwave Medical, which specializes in technology that helps open clogged arteries.
J.&J., a health care giant, said on Friday that it would spend $ 335 in cash for each share of Shockwave. The total deal value includes cash acquired. The deal has already been approved by the boards of directors from both companies.
Founded in 2009, Shockwave focuses on intravascular lithotripsy technology that uses sonic pressure waves to crack calcium lesions in arteries and restore blood flow. It's similar to a technique used to break up kidney stones. The sound wave emitters are placed inside angioplasty catheters to reach the calcified areas of the artery.
Shockwave's technology is used to treat coronary artery and peripheral artery disease. The company's revenue jumped 49 percent last year to $ 730 million.
J.&J. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told analysts on Friday that the market for this technology was still "in the early days of scaling up." He has said that he sees room for more growth both in and outside the United States, and the company expects annual sales to reach at least $ 1 billion.
J.&J. will use cash on hand and debt to pay for the deal. Financing costs will dilute the company's adjusted earnings by 10 cents per share this year and 17 cents in 2025, Mr. Wolk said.
The deal comes more than a year after J.&.J. said that it would spend $ 16 billion to buy another cardiovascular technology company, Abiomed. Both acquisitions are expected to bolster J.&.J.'s MedTech or medical device division. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: This week in Newly Reviewed, Travis Diehl covers Marian Zazeela's abstract calligraphy, Christopher Baliwas's "Skin 2 Skin" show and Luigi Zuccheri's surreal pastoral scenes.
Marian Zazeela
Through May 11. Artists Space, 11 Cortland Alley, Manhattan; 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org.
Marian Zazeela died on March 28 at age 83. A central figure of the New York avant-garde since the 1960s, Zazeela worked with light, paint and sound, often in collaboration with her husband, the minimalist composer La Monte Young. By coincidence (or resonance), a show at Artists Space called "Dream Lines" provides a rare concentrated view of her delicate and deep abstract calligraphy.
Moving clockwise around the gallery, you can see her technique grow. In pieces from 1962 and 1963, blocks of flared squiggles recall the holy pictorial lettering of Islam, ornamental strokes molded into bold shapes and replete with magnetic detail. The early drawings have the casual flair of studies. Pencil sketches underpin the compositions. One example, a rectangular congregation of serpentine blots, is inked on a paper towel.
By the late 1960s (one imagines, with devotional practice), Zazeela's marks are so saturated and clean that they don't feel drawn so much as placed. The lines curl into dense molars and concise arabesques, like visual mantras, repeated to form airy mandalas. The most seductive pieces include designs in colored ink; one square constellation of ruffled lines reminiscent of a Gothic chapel's floor plan steps from indigo to yellow. In another, rings of unerring green curls accent a hot pink page.
In 1963, Zazeela and Young moved into a TriBeCa apartment two blocks from Artists Space. On the third floor of their building is a 1993 iteration of their "Dream House," a public installation rigged with lavender light and a deep, droning raga -- a total calligraphy.
Christopher Baliwas
Through April 20. Theta, 184 Franklin Street, Manhattan; 917-262-0037, theta.nyc.
Recent wall works by Christopher Baliwas in his show "Skin 2 Skin" resemble what Frank Stella might have made if he'd worked at UPS: stripes of brown packing tape, overlapped into sheets, mounted on acrylic panels sticky side out. There's material pleasure here, a dirty variegation of tans wrung from an industrial product. But there are also faint, fragmented images. In the artist's bootleg transfer process, he layers tape over slick black-and-white inkjet prints of album covers, then pulls it up. Where the prints are white, the tawny adhesive sticks and stays behind, leaving transparent traces on the strips.
Baliwas is a D.J., former record shipper, father and photographer, and invokes all these shades of his life -- not to say identity -- in the works on view. A photograph farthest back in the gallery features his wife's pregnant belly under a tie-dye shirt blocking the view of his oldest daughter; a pale photo near the front door depicts the head of Andrew Cyrille, an avant-garde jazz drummer, floating among the halos of his cymbals. Baliwas snapped this shot at the Village Vanguard, printed it out and picked at the backing of the photo paper, then rephotographed it; this extra layer of haze mingles with those of memory and underground clubs.
Embodying this relay of images and materials is a large photo of dirt and grass, sliced into quadrants and backed by dark tape. A triangle of AstroTurf jutting into the frame tips off that this is a funeral; at the curling intersection of the four panels, jabbed into the earth waiting to be shoveled into the grave, is a GoPro camera.
Luigi Zuccheri
Through April 27. Karma, 188 East Second Street., Manhattan; 212-390-8290, karmakarma.org.
Monstrous figs line a country road, a fruit basket fills the town square, red primrose shades the yard. Luigi Zuccheri, born in 1904 to Italian aristocrats, began as a conventional, even retrograde modernist, assembling still lifes of fish and farm implements and studying ex-voto painting. But two world wars took their toll. Starting in 1950 he depicted a pastoral Italy distorted by hierarchical scale: Size conveys relative significance, not reality.
In Byzantine altarpieces, the saints are bigger than the parishioners and Jesus is bigger still. In Zuccheri's egg tempera paintings, flora and fauna loom in the foreground while human figures skitter through the middle distance. One river scene features a pair of nuzzling ducks twice as tall as the hiker on the opposite bank. A painting of a pond reveals the dramatic irony of a gargantuan crab.
Ocher and olive, soil and spoiled cream, filtered through yellowing varnish, churn on these warped panels. Unlike the crisp sensationalism visions of the canonical Surrealists, Zuccheri's inventions have a muddy matter-of-factness, as if nothing could be more normal than an elephantine otter.
In the second room, several smaller works share a basic composition: a wayfarer front and center surrounded by dog-size moths and grasshoppers. The brusque traveler goes about his business, almost an afterthought, except he's a constant. He's "you," like Caspar David Friedrich's Wanderer overlooking the sea: You feel the bigness of the turtles and wildflowers, and your own relative impermanence. The animals receive doting strokes, while the men are dashed off.
Last Chance
Maria Prymachenko
Through April 7. The Ukrainian Museum, 222 East Sixth Street, Manhattan; 212-228-0110, theukrainianmuseum.org.
If you know the name Maria Prymachenko, it might be because in February 2022, Russian forces attacked a Ukrainian museum that housed 14 of her paintings. People saved her art from the blaze, and Prymachenko -- a cultural icon in Ukraine -- became an international symbol of a nation's resilience.
In a way, this is fitting, since her exuberant art is allegorical and filled with allusions to folk tales. But it has also perhaps flattened her. If before she "was regarded as a benign, cheery folk artist," as one critic put it, lately she's been seen as an antiwar beacon of hope.
The show "Maria Prymachenko: Glory to Ukraine" suggests a more complex reality. The largest exhibition of her work outside of Europe, it features over 100 paintings, embroideries, ceramics and wooden plates. Prymachenko mostly painted flora and fauna, real and imagined, from proud peacocks to flowers with eyes and multiheaded beasts. Her style is cartoonish; her works patterned and repetitive, almost psychedelic.
Prymachenko, who was born in 1909 in Bolotnya, a village near Kyiv, survived a lot: polio, the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s, the deaths of her husband and brother in World War II, and Russification. You wouldn't immediately know this from her art, which vibrates with playful energy. But there's mania, too, in the surrealism of her images and the way her landscapes' almost eruptive states of bloom. More pointed works, such as "War Is Horrible" (1968) -- which shows a beast filled with the heads of other animals -- seem like the flip side to national paeans like "A Ukrainian Palianytsia" (1984), which depicts a couple holding up the titular loaf of bread. Prymachenko died in her hometown in 1997.
"Glory" is an apt word here -- not in the patriotic sense of the show's title, but in tribute to Prymachenko, whose talents demonstrate that she was weirder and more worldly than she gets credit for. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Khadim Ali
Through April 6. Aicon, 35 Great Jones Street, Manhattan; 212-725-6092, aicon.art.
Like Prymachenko, Khadim Ali also imagines creatures, although from a different time and place. The artist, who grew up in Pakistan near the Afghanistan border, comes from a family of Hazaras, a group persecuted by the Taliban. As a child, he was enchanted by his grandfather reciting verses from the "Shahnameh," an illustrated Persian epic poem. As a teenager, Ali worked on propaganda murals in Iran, before returning to Pakistan and studying miniature painting. Eventually he moved to Australia.
You can see these poetic and political influences at play in "Birth of Demons," his exhibition of paintings and tapestries. A series of delicate gouaches features a character with horns, wings and sagging belly. He represents the vilification of the Hazaras and other refugees, and is named after Rostam, a hero of the "Shahnameh." Set sometimes against a blood-red background, he seems to be stuck waiting, more pensive than gallant or menacing.
Ali's tapestries, collaborations with Afghan artisans, steal the show. In these big, dynamic scenes, the traditions of miniature and mural painting combine beautifully via embroidered silk. Two tapestries feature cartoonish jumbles of demons fighting in clouds. The third, "Birth of Demons 7" (2024), depicts a clown leading a procession of angels that carries a soldier-god. Ali's mythical world mirrors our own: glorified violence is as constant as the weather and there are no heroes coming to save us. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Vija Celmins
Through April 6. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com.
As an artist, Vija Celmins has always operated within a narrow bandwidth that she has expanded from the inside out, building a career-long meditation on time. The time needed for her to see, understand and render her mesmerizing images; the time needed for us to comprehend them and work back through the precision of her processes to the real thing. In the past several decades, some of her most consuming subjects have included quiet views of natural wonders: semiabstract yet meticulously realistic expanses of ocean waves, pebble-strewn desert floors and star-dotted night skies.
In "Winter," her first gallery show of new work in six years, Celmins has expanded her views of nature to include falling snow -- a rare depiction of weather, and of transience.
The titles often specify viewing conditions. The first painting, "Snow (Coat)" portrays snow collecting and melting on the back of a dark coat. The snow in "Snow (Window)," a light gray, daytime scene, might be seen through the subtle distortions of a pane of old, imperfect glass. In "Snowfall #1," #2, and #3, the snowflakes are especially starlike and distant, and bands of uneven white bubble along the canvases' bottom edge. Snow drifts? Foamy pounding surf? Perhaps the view from an entirely different perspective: above the clouds.
As for sculpture, the three trompe l'oeil treatments of rope (cast stainless steel, alkyd paint) may be too deadpan, even for Celmins. A large stone and its painted bronze twin reprise, but less perfectly than earlier works like this; I appreciated being able to see the difference. And if you search a bit, you'll find that "Snow (Coat)" has a twin of its own, deeper in the show. Eyes wide open, please. ROBERTA SMITH
'And Ever an Edge: Studio Museum Artists in Residence 2022--23'
Through April 8. MoMA PS1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Queens; (718) 784-2086, momaps1.org.
In 1968, the Studio Museum in Harlem initiated a yearly residency program that provided a stipend and studio space for making new art, with, as the museum's website notes, "priority given to artists working in nontraditional materials." This year's cohort of three young participants handily meets that formal criterion, as seen in their lively topping-off show, hosted by MoMA PS1 while the Studio Museum's new building is under construction.
Two of the artists create imaginative worlds from found materials. The first thing you see in a gallery of work by the Haitian-born Jeffrey Meris is a large suspended sculpture, "To the Rising Sun," made from dozens of outward-bristling crutches held together with C-clamps. The solar reference makes descriptive sense, though the piece also suggests a giant coronavirus. Apocalyptic, trending Afrofuturist, is the vibe here, in the presence of two silicone-cast human bodies that seem to be melting, and a monumental collage called "Imperial Strike" that catches a terrestrial Big Bang in progress.
A second alternative universe, this one a kind of magical garden of paintings and sculptures assembled by Devin N. Morris, is more recognizably earthly, with its images of landscapes and people. But it's formally even more unorthodox, combining standard art materials (watercolor, pastel, oil paint) with scraps salvaged from Harlem's streets: dice, mirror shards, electrical cords' wires, bamboo reeds, silk flowers, nail polish bottles and fentanyl test strips. Morris turns all of this into a kind of walk-through urban Eden of grit and delicacy.
The installation by Charisse Pearlina Weston feels more like a straightforward sculpture display, but this work too has its twists and contortions. Weston's primary medium is clear blown glass, often slumped, collapsed or broken, and, in some cases etched with barely readable images and words. While staying abstract it clearly alludes to authoritarian tactics including "broken-window policing." And the work here -- organized by Yelena Keller, an assistant curator at the Studio Museum, and Jody Graf, an assistant curator at MoMA PS1 -- along with her 2022 solo at the Queens Museum, establishes her a remarkable talent, and one fully arrived. HOLLAND COTTER
More to See
Christopher Wool
Through July 31. 101 Greenwich Street (entrance on Rector Street), Manhattan; seestoprun.com.
The dilapidated 19th-floor office space hosting Christopher Wool's recent sculptures and paintings could not be more simpatico with them. In its state of abandoned tear-down, the venue offers melodious visual rhymes: electrical cords dangling from the ceiling ape Wool's snarls of found-wire sculpture; crumbling plaster mirrors the attitudinal blotches of his oils and inks. Scrawls of crude graffiti or quickly penciled notes left by workmen emulate the tendril-like lines dragged through Wool's globular masses of spray paint. The space is a horseshoe-shaped echo of Wool's work -- raw, agitated -- and the restless elegance he wrenches from a feeling of decay.
Wool said he started to think about how environment affects the experience of looking at art when he began splitting his time between New York and Marfa, in West Texas. Photographic series he made there, like "Westtexaspsychosculpture," depict forlorn whorls of fencing-wire debris that look like uncanny mimics of Wool's own writhing scribbles, and which inspired scaled-up versions cast in bronze. (The Marfa landscape is fertile ground for New York artists. Rauschenberg made his scrap metal assemblages after witnessing the oil-ruined landscape of 1980s Texas, what he called "souvenirs without nostalgia," a designation that's appropriate here, too.)
Place has always seeped into Wool's work. His photographs of the grime and trash-strewn streets of the Lower East Side in the 1990s -- compiled as "East Broadway Breakdown" -- aren't included here, but "Incident on 9th Street" (1997), of his own burned-out studio, are. The chaos of those scenes repeat here, the wraparound floor plan and endless windows letting the city permeate the work, just as it did in their making. MAX LAKIN
Paa Joe
Through April 27. Superhouse, 120 Walker Street, 6R, Manhattan; superhouse.us.
A cheerful mortuary feeling runs through the Ghanaian master craftsman Paa Joe's exhibition of fantastical coffins. These figurative pieces are closer to sculpture than burial vessel, even though he's been committing them to the earth for over 60 years. Carved from wood and painted with enamel, they update ancient traditions of funerary art into idiosyncratically honest, if reductive, portraits of the deceased -- disproportionately sized vegetables or wildlife alluding to their trade, social status, or consumerist fetish. (Imagine an Ancient Egyptian sarcophagus shaped like a Mercedes-Benz). They are equal parts reverence and exuberance, sacred and profane.
Here, Joe and his studio, run by his son, Jacob Tetteh-Ashong, speak in the visual shorthand of New York City caricature: bagel-and-schmear, yellow cab, pizza box. Others are more nuanced homages: an Hermès Birkin handbag stands in for the city's scarcity-luxury complex; an oversized cigarette, perhaps, the resurgent affectation of the downtown scene. Scale is elastic, often to disorienting effect. The Guggenheim Museum and Statue of Liberty are compressed into cartoon abbreviations, a rat and hot dog are inflated to horrific proportions. Most are smaller than body-size. Following attention from Western collectors in the 1980s, Joe began making tabletop versions more palatable for home display, sacrificing their morbid thrust for Pop whimsy.
In a gallery context, the coffins straddle the gap between art object and craft, sometimes uneasily. The absurd, kitsch delight of an eight-foot-tall replica of a Heinz ketchup bottle stiffens when the lid is pried open to reveal its silk-lined cavity, filling the room with the reminder of your mortality. Still, it's hard to think of anything more appropriate than a gleaming taxi to ferry a New Yorker into the next life. MAX LAKIN
C'naan Hamburger
Through April 20. Charles Moffett, 437 Washington Street, second floor; (212) 226-2646, charlesmoffett.com.
The poetic stillness with which C'naan Hamburger renders her streetscapes might seem foreign to any New Yorker who has had the displeasure of experiencing scaffolding going up. Yet that's the mood of "14 Stations," meticulous pen-on-paper drawings unfurling that process, a riff on the narrative painting conventions that portray the crucifixion. Hamburger's version is just as devotional, rendering a quotidian element of street life in exacting detail.
That reverence continues across six small egg tempera paintings that depict the minutiae of maintenance the city undergoes daily, largely unnoticed -- the superficial touch-ups of caution lines on subway steps, the indeterminate electrical repair that erupts in crosswalks. Hamburger's pictures are less about the veneration of labor -- no one is ever working too hard -- than our delusive attempts at resisting nature's course. Deterioration is guaranteed, death is inescapable. Like the warped skull haunting Holbein's "The Ambassadors," Hamburger's heap of construction barriers are an allegory that's invisible until it isn't.
Hamburger has a delicate touch, and her compositions float together airily, bringing to mind the romantic landscapes of the Hudson River School, as if Asher B. Durand had painted ConEd trucks. Just as romantic is her decision to grind material scraped from her sites into pigment, charging her paintings with a talismanic power (most punkishly in "Wall Power" (2024), which samples a wall of the Breuer Building). It's a choice that both hastens the disintegration of her subjects, however imperceptibly, and heartbreakingly underscores their vulnerability. MAX LAKIN
Huma Bhabha
Through April 13. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-517-8677, davidzwirner.com.
Huma Bhabha's first show of sculpture at David Zwirner, "Welcome ... to the one who came," consists of seven sculptures -- four figures and three heads -- all radiating ruination. Sparsely installed in the two spaces on the gallery's ground floor, they show Bhabha decisively expanding both the means and expression of her work, although it should be said that our troubled times all but rise to meet her efforts. They seem implicitly antiwar, and, in their compressed forms, the inverse of Thomas Hirschhorn's equally excellent "Fake It, Fake It -- Till you Fake It," a sprawling excess of violence, destruction and advanced technology recently seen at Gladstone.
Rummaging through dead civilizations, Bhabha, who was born in Pakistan in 1962 and came to the United States in 1981, conjures ravaged idols that we know on sight. They have the four-sided rigidity of both enthroned Egyptian pharaohs and Transformers action figures. Bhabha achieves this effect by defining limbs and torsos with deep incisions but rarely in the round. (They can bring to mind Brancusi.)
Two of the heads resemble hollow helmets of skin with torn openings for eyes; they show Bhabha sculpting in clay and then casting for the first time in iron, for a raw, fiery surface. The immense head of the peg-legged giant titled "Even Stones Have Eyes," has been slashed and gouged with a special viciousness, evoking one of Philip Guston's monstrous skulls. Would that this heroic horror could unseat William Tecumseh Sherman at Grand Army Plaza. ROBERTA SMITH
Shana Moulton
Through April 21. Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street; (212) 708-9400, moma.org.
Cynthia is back, with all her psychic and physical baggage and a welter of new products purchased to ease her pain. These measures don't work, of course, because Cynthia, the alter ego of artist Shana Moulton, is a modern-day Sisyphus, pushing a boulder up the hill of Wellness, only to have it plunge back down again. "Meta/Physical Therapy" at the Museum of Modern Art is the latest in Moulton's "Whispering Pines" series of videos, which make frequent reference to 20th-century spiritual art. Here, Cynthia is reaching for healing and enlightenment in the God-is-Dead.com era.
"Meta/Physical Therapy" finds Cynthia dutifully trying out various yoga-Pilates-Gyrokinesis-type exercises; having a run-in with an isolation tank; and encountering an eerie supernatural being. The installation also includes smaller videos of swimming dolphins and translucent sculptures of creatures and symbols. One of my favorite touches is a video projected on the floor in which Cynthia floats, Ophelia-like, in a stream that winds around the gallery.
Moulton's brilliant character and portrayal captures a certain kind of white-lady malaise -- the flip side of the angry Karen (or perhaps her silent neighbor). Nothing seems outwardly wrong: Cynthia can go out into the California sunshine and buy all the products she wants. Truthfully, this isn't my absolute favorite "Whispering Pines" video, but this is a minor quibble. As Cynthia approaches menopause and aging, her existential crisis is more pressing. Will she find comfort and serenity? Unlikely -- and yet, I will stay tuned. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Candace Hill-Montgomery
Through May 4, Blank Forms, 468 Grand Avenue, Brooklyn; (347) 916-0833, blankforms.org.
Candace Hill-Montgomery's remarkable résumé includes everything from runway modeling to babysitting Count Basie's daughter while she was growing up in Queens. She exhibited at Artists Space in 1979 and created installations devoted to Black activists like Fred Hampton and to cuts in federal assistance. However, she's been absent from the New York gallery scene since the early 1980s, and her current show of textiles made between 2016 and 2023 at Blank Forms offers a strong reintroduction.
A majority of the works in "Pretty Birds Peer Speak Sow Peculiar" are small weavings created on a handmade loom. Like jazz musicians improvising, Hill-Montgomery goes way off the grid of the loom, piecing together different sections and attaching non-textile elements. One work is dedicated to "the Carters" (that is, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, Jay-Z and family) and has foam earplugs dangling from its threads. Another has a 3D-printed chain, while a third has a skirt of little pendant weavings that echo the patterns on afghans. Other works are dedicated to Kanye West, Richard III and a secret trip to Afghanistan that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California took in 2019.
From the famous Bauhaus, where women who wanted to paint were sent to the weaving workshop, to the Black female artists in Alabama making Gee's Bend quilts, fiber arts have proven to be a powerful vehicle for some of the most canny and talented artists in the last century. Hill-Montgomery's weavings add another entry to this field. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Ford Throttles Back on Electric Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker said it would delay new battery-powered models and shift its focus to hybrid cars, sales of which are rising fast.
Ford Motor on Thursday delayed the production of at least two new electric cars and said it would pivot to making more hybrids. Its decision was the latest sign that large automakers have been forced to rethink their strategy for electric vehicles because sales for those models are slowing.
The shift by Ford and automakers like General Motors and Mercedes-Benz, which have also pushed back their electric car plans, has been prompted largely by the companies' difficulties in making and selling enough electric cars and doing so profitably.
Sales of such vehicles are still growing, but the pace has slowed sharply in recent months as automakers have tapped out many of the early adopters who were willing to spend more than $ 50,000 on a new battery-powered car. Because they are still learning how to make the cars and their batteries at lower cost, the companies have not been able to bring out more affordable models.
"Many companies rushed in too fast with E.V.s that were too expensive and there was not as much of a market for them as they thought," Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at the research firm Guidehouse Insights, said. "That's made it a lot tougher to sell those vehicles."
Some consumers are also reluctant to buy electric models because they can't charge the vehicles at home or are worried that there won't be enough public chargers available when they want to travel more than a couple of hundred miles.
Many car buyers interested in electric vehicles appear to be choosing hybrid cars, which can cost just a few hundred dollars more than comparable gasoline-only models and in some cases offer much better fuel economy. Those cars are also easier for consumers to get used to because they don't have to be plugged in and are fueled like conventional models.
Andy Goodrich, a retired software engineer in Ann Arbor, Mich., was considering buying a Tesla Model 3 or a Rivian sport-utility vehicle, but had concerns about finding charging stations. Ultimately, he chose a Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which can go about 40 miles on electric power alone before switching to a gasoline engine.
"I do most of my driving locally, so I can go a week or more without using any gas," Mr. Goodrich, 72, said. "I charge in my garage overnight and I'm all set for the day. If I have to go to Grand Rapids or something, then the gas engine gets me there."
Ford said on Thursday that it hoped to offer a hybrid version of every model it sold by the end of the decade. It already makes hybrid versions of two pickups -- the Maverick and the F-150 -- and its Escape crossover.
The company said it was now planning to start making a large electric S.U.V. at its plant in Oakville, Ontario, in 2027, two years later than it had planned. A plant that Ford is building in Tennessee will start making an electric pickup truck in 2026, a year later than originally scheduled.
"We are committed to scaling a profitable E.V. business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
Ford has set up a small team in Irvine, Calif. -- far from the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. -- to develop components that can be used to produce lower-cost electric vehicles. That group is led by a former Tesla executive, Alan Clarke.
"We're also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller E.V. products," Mr. Farley said in a conference call in February. Ford's electric vehicle business lost $ 4.7 billion before interest and taxes in 2023. By contrast, the division that makes gasoline and hybrid vehicles for consumers made a $ 7.5 billion profit.
The slowdown in sales is also hurting the leading maker of electric models in the United States, Tesla. This week it reported an unexpected 8.5 percent decrease in sales of its electric cars in the first three months of the year.
On Wednesday, Ford said its sales of electric vehicles had grown 86 percent in the quarter, to 20,223 vehicles, but the total was well below the level the company once hoped to reach and came after it cut some prices.
The company sold more than 7,700 F-150 Lightning pickups, its flagship electric model, in the three months. As recently as last summer, Ford hoped to be able to produce some 150,000 Lightnings trucks a year. The company recently reduced Lightning production to one shift per day from two.
Two years ago, Ford, G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers were planning to introduce dozens of new electric cars and trucks, expecting consumers to make a rapid transition to electric vehicles from gasoline-powered vehicles.
But starting in the second half of 2023, the growth in electric sales decreased significantly, forcing manufacturers to scale back their ambitions. Ford and G.M. have also slowed work on factories that are supposed to supply battery packs for their new electric models.

Auto Executives Call for New Measures in E.V. Wars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The latest proposal comes from Luca de Meo, the C.E.O. of Renault Group, who is pushing for an Airbus-inspired alliance that would help European automakers fend off competition from cheaper Chinese-made electric vehicles.
An auto C.E.O.'s plan to fend off China
Tesla is scheduled to announce first-quarter delivery data this week, a key update as investors grow increasingly rattled about Chinese rivals -- especially the Warren Buffett-backed BYD -- gaining ground in the electric vehicle race.
Tesla's stock is down nearly 30 percent this year, with short sellers circling.
Politicians and auto executives on both sides of the Atlantic are calling for more protectionist measures. After Tesla lost its crown to BYD as the world's biggest E.V. maker, Elon Musk signaled that trade barriers may be needed. Otherwise, the Tesla C.E.O. said, Chinese E.V. makers "will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world."
Luca de Meo, Renault Group's C.E.O., is pushing for a more radical approach, Vivienne Walt reports for DealBook. His answer to the China threat: an E.V. alliance modeled on Airbus, the heavily state-supported planemaker.
"The prosperity of Europe is at stake," he wrote recently in a 19-page open letter designed to get politicians' attention ahead of June's E.U. parliamentary elections. The continent's auto sector employs 13 million people and generates 8 percent of the bloc's G.D.P.
Here's what de Meo has in mind: European auto giants would join forces on battery and semiconductor production and on research and development in an effort to bring down E.V. manufacturing costs and better compete against their non-European rivals. "If they're competing as they are, they are weaker in front of China," Felipe Munoz, senior analyst for JATO Dynamics, an auto consulting firm, told DealBook. "Their E. V.s are still very expensive. They have problems with battery production."
Airbus is one of Europe's great successes, having overtaken Boeing as the world's largest commercial planemaker. (Both companies have accused the other of receiving unfair competitive advantages, culminating in a W.T.O. ruling that each of them had received preferential subsidies.)
Chinese companies have an operating edge. Labor is cheaper in Shenzhen than in Detroit or Berlin. They have built operational efficiencies and get hefty government support. And China controls the bulk of global raw materials for E.V. batteries, like lithium, which the West is frantically scrambling to source. "Chinese E.V. makers have a structural cost advantage of 25 percent," Patrick Hummel, a UBS auto analyst, told DealBook.
Trade barriers are unlikely to slow China's growth. "Any tariff increase will have an impact, but it won't deter them from arriving," Munoz said. "This will be a war between tariffs on one side, and subsidies on the other."
An Airbus-type venture may face headwinds. Executives at Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz last month said they didn't want to see an auto trade war. Both companies have strong businesses in China, and have tried to distance themselves from a European Commission investigation into whether China is giving its domestic carmakers market-distorting subsidies. "We stand for free trade," said Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's C.F.O.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
A $ 20-per-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers begins today in California. The law, which has been vigorously opposed by the industry, applies to most of the sector's workers in the state, and requires that employers also offer paid overtime and family leave. Under Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, California has championed some of the nation's most generous workers' rights provisions, with all health care employees set to receive a $ 25 minimum wage by 2028.
The Senate reportedly plans to amend the House's TikTok bill. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the Democratic chair of the Commerce Committee, is expected to push for changes to a proposal that could ban the app in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reports. This could include giving ByteDance more time to divest TikTok, or broadening the bill to address other social media platforms. Meanwhile, the former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin's bid to buy TikTok is meeting increased skepticism.
Nippon Steel vows to press ahead with a $ 14 billion deal to buy U.S. Steel. Tadashi Imai, Nippon's new president, said the Japanese company would negotiate with U.S. Steel's union workers to win their support. The acquisition has become a hot election issue, with President Biden signaling that U.S. Steel should be domestically owned ahead of a summit with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on April 10.
Debate grows over rebuilding the Baltimore bridge
Workers have removed the first section of the mangled Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, a step toward reopening the shipping channel. The question now turns to who should pay to rebuild the vital transport span with President Biden set to visit the city this week.
Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, yesterday urged Congress to authorize the needed money, emphasizing that the bridge collapse could have an impact on the wider economy. With cost estimates of at least $ 2 billion, not everyone in Washington is on board, however.
"Your district could be next, and this has historically been bipartisan," Buttigieg told CBS News's "Face the Nation." Biden said last week that the federal government would pay "the entire cost" of rebuilding -- the Transportation Department has secured a $ 60 million "down payment," but that's not enough to complete the work.
But there's bipartisan hesitation. Representative Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, called Biden's funding pledge "outrageous" and "a knee-jerk spend reaction."
Other lawmakers want to see the companies involved in the crash (and their insurers) pay at least part of the cost. "I don't think it has to be federal taxpayer money," John Garamendi, a Democrat from California and a senior member of the House Transportation Committee, told Bloomberg last week. "Let's first go to the insurance side of it, and then we'll see what's left over."
The industry is bracing for a hefty tab. John Neal, the C.E.O of Lloyd's of London, called the disaster "one of the biggest marine losses in history." Morningstar analysts, meanwhile, estimate that it could cost insurers as much as $ 4 billion.
The collision puts the spotlight on maritime safety and size. Larry Hogan, the former Republican governor of Maryland who is running for U.S. Senate, courted mega-ships during his term in office, from 2015 to 2023, according to Lever News. That's despite a report from Allianz, the insurer, that flagged "risk management concerns" posed by the giant vessels.
The supersized ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge was loaded with about 4,700 40-foot shipping containers, an increasingly common sight amid a global shipping boom. In contrast, ships that sailed at the time the bridge was built in 1977 held about half that.
An A.I. warning label
A big worry about artificial intelligence involves tech companies using huge amounts of public data -- including names, phone numbers and addresses -- to train their A.I. models.
A recent Commerce Department report on improving A.I. accountability offered a suggestion on how to demystify the technology. It included an image that is familiar to most of us: a nutrition label -- but for data, not food.
The idea would be for tech companies to use the label to inform businesses and consumers about how they are using their data for A.I. Such labels could "present the most important information about a model in a relatively brief, standardized, and comparable form," the report said.
The week ahead
Jobs, inflation data, and a mega proxy fight looms. Here's what to watch for this week.
Wednesday: Eurozone Consumer Price Index data is scheduled for release. The markets are pricing in a June interest-rate cut if inflation can remain in check.
Elsewhere, Levi Strauss, whose jeans make a prominent appearance in Beyoncé's latest album, reports earnings. Disney holds its annual shareholders meeting, where its fight against the activist investor Nelson Peltz is expected to come to a head.
Thursday: Donald Trump faces a deadline in his civil fraud case: post a $ 175 million bond, or risk the New York attorney general seizing assets.
Friday: It's jobs day. Economists polled by Bloomberg have forecast that employers added at least 200,000 jobs in March. They also expect a slight slowdown in wage gains.
Market quiz, crypto edition
Bitcoin was trading around $ 69,500 this morning after a rally that saw the cryptocurrency soar 67 percent in the first quarter. Much of the surge came after the S.E.C. approved the creation of new exchange-traded funds in January, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the token.
Which of the following performed even better in the first quarter?
A) The Nasdaq Composite
B) Japan's Nikkei
C) Cocoa futures
D) Brent crude
The answer: C, cocoa futures, which have more than doubled this year following exceptionally poor cocoa bean harvests in West Africa.

Full text: Christopher Wool
Through July 31. 101 Greenwich Street (entrance on Rector Street), Manhattan; seestoprun.com.
The dilapidated 19th-floor office space hosting Christopher Wool's recent sculptures and paintings could not be more simpatico with them. In its state of abandoned tear-down, the venue offers melodious visual rhymes: electrical cords dangling from the ceiling ape Wool's snarls of found-wire sculpture; crumbling plaster mirrors the attitudinal blotches of his oils and inks. Scrawls of crude graffiti or quickly penciled notes left by workmen emulate the tendril-like lines dragged through Wool's globular masses of spray paint. The space is a horseshoe-shaped echo of Wool's work -- raw, agitated -- and the restless elegance he wrenches from a feeling of decay.
Wool said he started to think about how environment affects the experience of looking at art when he began splitting his time between New York and Marfa, in West Texas. Photographic series he made there, like "Westtexaspsychosculpture," depict forlorn whorls of fencing-wire debris that look like uncanny mimics of Wool's own writhing scribbles, and which inspired scaled-up versions cast in bronze. (The Marfa landscape is fertile ground for New York artists. Rauschenberg made his scrap metal assemblages after witnessing the oil-ruined landscape of 1980s Texas, what he called "souvenirs without nostalgia," a designation that's appropriate here, too.)
Place has always seeped into Wool's work. His photographs of the grime and trash-strewn streets of the Lower East Side in the 1990s -- compiled as "East Broadway Breakdown" -- aren't included here, but "Incident on 9th Street" (1997), of his own burned-out studio, are. The chaos of those scenes repeat here, the wraparound floor plan and endless windows letting the city permeate the work, just as it did in their making.
Paa Joe
Through April 27. Superhouse, 120 Walker Street, 6R, Manhattan; superhouse.us.
A cheerful mortuary feeling runs through the Ghanaian master craftsman Paa Joe's exhibition of fantastical coffins. These figurative pieces are closer to sculpture than burial vessel, even though he's been committing them to the earth for over 60 years. Carved from wood and painted with enamel, they update ancient traditions of funerary art into idiosyncratically honest, if reductive, portraits of the deceased -- disproportionately sized vegetables or wildlife alluding to their trade, social status, or consumerist fetish. (Imagine an Ancient Egyptian sarcophagus shaped like a Mercedes-Benz). They are equal parts reverence and exuberance, sacred and profane.
Here, Joe and his studio, run by his son, Jacob Tetteh-Ashong, speak in the visual shorthand of New York City caricature: bagel-and-schmear, yellow cab, pizza box. Others are more nuanced homages: an Hermès Birkin handbag stands in for the city's scarcity-luxury complex; an oversized cigarette, perhaps, the resurgent affectation of the downtown scene. Scale is elastic, often to disorienting effect. The Guggenheim Museum and Statue of Liberty are compressed into cartoon abbreviations, a rat and hot dog are inflated to horrific proportions. Most are smaller than body-size. Following attention from Western collectors in the 1980s, Joe began making tabletop versions more palatable for home display, sacrificing their morbid thrust for Pop whimsy.
In a gallery context, the coffins straddle the gap between art object and craft, sometimes uneasily. The absurd, kitsch delight of an eight-foot-tall replica of a Heinz ketchup bottle stiffens when the lid is pried open to reveal its silk-lined cavity, filling the room with the reminder of your mortality. Still, it's hard to think of anything more appropriate than a gleaming taxi to ferry a New Yorker into the next life.
C'naan Hamburger
Through April 20. Charles Moffett, 437 Washington Street, second floor; (212) 226-2646, charlesmoffett.com.
The poetic stillness with which C'naan Hamburger renders her streetscapes might seem foreign to any New Yorker who has had the displeasure of experiencing scaffolding going up. Yet that's the mood of "14 Stations," meticulous pen-on-paper drawings unfurling that process, a riff on the narrative painting conventions that portray the crucifixion. Hamburger's version is just as devotional, rendering a quotidian element of street life in exacting detail.
That reverence continues across six small egg tempera paintings that depict the minutiae of maintenance the city undergoes daily, largely unnoticed -- the superficial touch-ups of caution lines on subway steps, the indeterminate electrical repair that erupts in crosswalks. Hamburger's pictures are less about the veneration of labor -- no one is ever working too hard -- than our delusive attempts at resisting nature's course. Deterioration is guaranteed, death is inescapable. Like the warped skull haunting Holbein's "The Ambassadors," Hamburger's heap of construction barriers are an allegory that's invisible until it isn't.
Hamburger has a delicate touch, and her compositions float together airily, bringing to mind the romantic landscapes of the Hudson River School, as if Asher B. Durand had painted ConEd trucks. Just as romantic is her decision to grind material scraped from her sites into pigment, charging her paintings with a talismanic power (most punkishly in "Wall Power" (2024), which samples a wall of the Breuer Building). It's a choice that both hastens the disintegration of her subjects, however imperceptibly, and heartbreakingly underscores their vulnerability.

Tesla's Issues Shattering Its Mystique: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As the share price plunges, investors wonder whether the company, led by Elon Musk, can withstand intensifying competition.
Elon Musk appeared to be in a defiant mood Wednesday when he stood before employees at Tesla's factory near Berlin a week after an arsonist set fire to a high-voltage power pylon and brought production to a standstill.
"They can't stop us," Mr. Musk, the company's chief executive, told workers in a giant tent beside the plant.
But there are proliferating signs that Tesla may not be as unstoppable as it once seemed. The company's car sales are no longer growing at a torrid pace. Chinese automakers and established brands like BMW and Volkswagen are flooding the market with electric cars. And Tesla has been slow to respond with new models.
Mr. Musk's many outside ventures, and his penchant for making polarizing political statements and attacking people he disagrees with, have raised questions about how focused he remains on managing Tesla. Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the company: Tesla's share price has lost one-third of its value this year even as major stock indexes have hit record highs.
"A bet on Tesla has always been a bet on Mr. Musk," said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School who focuses on corporate law, governance and finance.
In an interview with the former television anchor Don Lemon that streamed online on Monday, Mr. Musk brushed off the drop in the company's share price as part of the cycle.
"The stocks go up and down, but what really matters is are we making and delivering great products," Mr. Musk said.
The weeklong production stop at Tesla's factory in Grünheide, its second this year, was only a temporary setback. But the decline in the share price indicates that investors are reassessing Tesla's long-term prospects and are no longer certain that the company -- still worth more than any other carmaker -- will one day dominate the industry.
Mr. Musk can take much of the credit for goading other automakers to focus on electric cars, proving that they could be practical, profitable and fun. Tesla's Model Y sport utility vehicle was the best-selling car of any kind in the world last year.
But Tesla has not added a mass-market vehicle to its lineup since the Model Y went on sale in 2020. Chinese automakers like BYD, SAIC and Geely Auto are bringing out dozens of new models. Analysts said Tesla's Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that went on sale in limited numbers last year, would probably appeal to a relatively narrow set of buyers given its high price and unconventional design. And while Tesla is working on an electric car that would cost around $ 25,000, it is not expected to go on sale in large numbers until 2026.
"I'm a little surprised at this point there hasn't been the next thing," said Michael Lenox, a professor of business administration at the University of Virginia who studies industries undergoing technological upheaval.
Tesla has repeatedly adjusted prices in response to demand, cutting them to boost sales and then sometimes raising them again. While the cuts have helped make electric cars more affordable, analysts say the strategy has eroded the company's profits without doing much to increase revenue. The cuts have also sharply lowered the resale value of Tesla cars, because no one pays more for a used car than a new one.
The strategy trains potential buyers "to wait for a deal," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, said on X. Mr. Black, who has more than 400,000 followers on X, which Mr. Musk owns, has long been a Tesla optimist, but the fund recently sold some of its shares in the company.
Tesla faces particularly intense competition in China, the world's largest car market, where more than one-third of new car sales are electric. BYD surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales in the last three months of 2023 with a broad array of sedans, sport utility vehicles and cheap subcompacts. Its Seagull model sells for less than $ 12,000 in China.
Even after Tesla's price cuts, the Model 3 sedans and the Model Y S.U.V.s made at a factory in Shanghai are far more expensive than many Chinese models. European and Chinese automakers are also introducing new electric vehicles at a dizzying rate. More than 150 will go on sale by the end of the year, according to HSBC.
At the same time, Tesla is not well positioned to compete in the luxury market because its cars don't offer as many amenities as cars made by the likes of BMW or Mercedes-Benz, said John Helveston, an assistant professor of engineering management at George Washington University who has studied Chinese car-buying habits.
"In China, there are so many great options that Tesla just falls in the middle," Mr. Helveston said. "It's an overpriced car for the luxury you get out of it."
Tesla has not told investors how it will regain ground in China, which generates the bulk of its sales. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
"What will they pull out of their toolbox other than price cuts to keep them in the mix in 2024?" asked Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a research firm. "The price-cut tool has lost its effectiveness."
Mr. Musk's disdain for the established way of doing things, as well as his love of big engineering challenges, has made it difficult for Tesla to bring out new products quickly, Mr. Helveston said. The Cybertruck is an example. It is made of stainless steel, which resists rust better than conventional steel but is notoriously difficult to work with. The truck arrived two years behind schedule and took up resources that could have been used for products with broader appeal.
"Tesla could be doing far better than it is if they had been less aggressive in trying to do everything new and used half the knowledge out there that works," Mr. Helveston said.
But doing new things excites Mr. Musk, who chuckled with glee when telling Mr. Lemon about the revamped version of the company's Roadster sports car, which he said Tesla planned to bring out at the end of the year. The vehicle will combine technology from Tesla and his rocket company, SpaceX, "to create something that's not really a car," he said.
In Europe, the Model Y was the best-selling electric car last year. But Volkswagen and its Audi, Skoda and SEAT brands together sold more electric vehicles than Tesla on the continent, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. Sales of the Model Y fell at the end of the year after Germany and other countries cut subsidies.
Tesla could also suffer from restrictions that the European Union is considering imposing on Chinese imports. All Model 3 sedans sold in Europe and the right-hand-drive Model Y for Britain are imported from Shanghai. Tesla accounts for one of every four Chinese-made cars imported by Europe, according to Schmidt.
"This would narrow what has been impressive, but nonetheless narrowing, profit margins and make a more even playing field for European automakers that have been manufacturing locally," said Matthias Schmidt, founder of the research firm. He noted that France had taken protectionist policies a step further by restricting government subsidies for purchases of electric vehicles to those produced in the European Union. Italy has indicated it may do the same.
Mr. Musk is also a source of uncertainty. In January a Delaware judge struck down his pay package, worth more than $ 50 billion, saying Tesla's board of directors used a flawed process in negotiating his compensation. In response, Mr. Musk threatened to move Tesla's corporate registration from Delaware to Texas.
Tesla's board has not unveiled a new pay package for him. Mr. Musk, who oversees SpaceX and several other businesses in addition to Tesla and X, has threatened to pursue unspecified new ventures outside Tesla unless he is given control over 25 percent of the company. He currently owns about 13 percent.
"You now have a grumpy C.E.O.," said Mr. Talley of Columbia Law School. "What does that portend for the ability of Tesla to command Mr. Musk's attention? Is it possible he would just disengage from the company?"
Mr. Musk's whistle-stop visit to Grünheide appeared timed to show employees in Germany, some of whom had voiced concern about their safety after the arson, that he remains committed to the company and the factory. The plant is producing around 300,000 cars per year, but aims to expand that to as many as one million.
Asked by reporters whether he intended to stick to that plan, Mr. Musk responded, "Yes, absolutely."

Volkswagen Workers Plan Vote on Joining U.A.W.
Workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., will vote next month on whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers union.
The National Labor Relations Board said Monday that the election will take place from April 17 to 19 at the plant, in the first test of the union's effort to organize nonunion automobile factories across the nation.
Workers at the 3.8 million square foot factory with more than 4,000 production workers filed paperwork March 18 seeking the election.
The U.A.W. announced its organizing campaign last fall after it won strong contracts with Detroit automakers. The U.A.W. said it would simultaneously target more than a dozen nonunion auto plants including those run by Tesla, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Honda, and others. Associated Press

Nissan Aims to Expand Stable of Electric Vehicles
Nissan will expand its electric vehicle lineup, develop more powerful batteries and cut production costs, while speeding up the process, in what the Japanese auto maker's chief called "The Arc" pathway to higher sales by 2030.
"The auto industry is now being forced to reshape its values so we can say continuous change is the new normal," Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive said on Monday in outlining an ambitious business plan. "Nissan must change. We cannot succeed if we continue along the same path."
Costs will come down for electric models so they'll be about the same as gasoline models by fiscal 2030, while global sales will grow by a million vehicles during that period, he added.
Last year, Nissan Motor Co. sold nearly 3.4 million vehicles around the world, up about 5 percent from the previous year.
The company is planning 30 new models over the next three years, 16 of them E.V.s. Nissan plans to launch 34 E.V. models from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2030. Associated Press
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Ericsson to Lay Off 1,200 Over Lagging 5G Sales
Ericsson said on Monday that it would lay off about 1,200 employees in Sweden as part of cost-cutting measures announced this year as customers reduce their spending on 5G gear.
After cutting thousands of staff last year, telecoms equipment suppliers like Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are expecting 2024 to remain challenging as 5G equipment sales slow in North America and are also expected to ease from record levels in India.
Ericsson told Reuters in January it could look at further cost cuts this year including layoffs.
Citing ongoing negotiations with unions, the company declined to give a figure for how much it could save by cutting staff.
The company said it would continue with initiatives to increase operational efficiency during 2024. Reuters

New Jersey's First Lady Ends Campaign for Menendez's Senate Seat: [Correction]

Full text: Ms. Murphy, the first lady of New Jersey, had racked up early endorsements from Democratic Party leaders in the state, but she struggled to gain support among rank-and-file voters.
Tammy Murphy, New Jersey's first lady, has ended her run for a U.S. Senate seat now held by the state's embattled senior senator, Robert Menendez, she announced on Sunday in a video posted to social media.
Ms. Murphy said that she had concluded that continuing to compete in the Democratic primary against Representative Andy Kim, a third-term congressman from South Jersey, would mean waging a "very divisive and negative campaign."
She was unwilling to do that, she said, and instead decided to suspend her campaign and to "focus entirely on re-electing President Biden" and other Democrats.
"With Donald Trump on the ballot and so much at stake for our nation, I will not in good conscience waste resources tearing down a fellow Democrat," she said.
An aide said that Ms. Murphy, the wife of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, held a meeting with county Democratic Party leaders at 2 p.m. on Sunday before making a final decision and notifying her campaign staff members.
Candidates who plan to run in June's primary are required to file petitions with at least 1,000 signatures by the end of the day on Monday. Ms. Murphy's decision on the eve of that deadline means that her name will not appear on the primary ballot.
Her exit makes Mr. Kim an odds-on favorite to become New Jersey's next senator and the first Korean American member of the U.S. Senate.
"Tammy and I both agree that it is critical that we keep this seat, and the Senate, in Democratic control," Mr. Kim, 41, said in a statement. "Unity is vital. We will continue our efforts to strengthen our democracy in New Jersey, while we come together to stand up against the dangerous agenda pushed by Trump."
Ms. Murphy, 58, entered the race in November and was instantly endorsed by a coalition of influential Democratic Party leaders, including many whose livelihoods are dependent on the governor, who has nearly two years left in his term. Her bid led to virtually nonstop claims of nepotism by critics, who argued that the governor and Ms. Murphy, a first-time candidate with limited experience, were exploiting New Jersey's entrenched system of boss politics.
Mr. Kim jumped into the race a day after Mr. Menendez was charged in September with accepting bribes of gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for his political influence. Since then, Mr. Kim has successfully yoked Ms. Murphy's campaign to what he called the same style of "broken politics" that nurtured and protected Mr. Menendez for decades.
The first independent poll of the race showed Ms. Murphy was trailing Mr. Kim by 12 percentage points. Other surveys conducted by campaigns and political organizations showed Ms. Murphy, who until 10 years ago was registered to vote as a Republican, even farther behind.
Then, in the midst of the high-stakes primary contest, Mr. Kim filed a lawsuit that directly challenged an essential component of the state's electoral system -- a ballot structure designed to benefit the favored candidates of local political leaders. The practice allows county leaders to bracket their preferred candidates for every office together in a single row or column, a preferential ballot position known in New Jersey as "the line."
The so-called line can be used to reward or to punish, encouraging fealty from candidates and making it difficult for unendorsed challengers to win.
Last week, Mr. Kim spent more than an hour testifying in court after asking a federal judge to force the state to redesign the ballot before the June 4 primary. Adding fuel to the debate, the state's attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, announced a week ago that he, too, considered the state's ballot structure unconstitutional.
The judge, Zahid N. Quraishi of U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, is expected to rule on Mr. Kim's request in the coming weeks.
The lawsuit and Mr. Platkin's unwillingness to defend the statutes that enable the current ballot design have shaken New Jersey's politics to its core. Mr. Platkin had been one of the staunchest allies of the first lady and the governor; he worked on Mr. Murphy's first campaign and served for years as the governor's top government lawyer before the governor nominated him for attorney general.
Last week, Democratic and Republican legislative leaders who derive much of their power from "the line" said, for the first time, that they were open to reconsidering the ballot design. The move was seen as an effort to forestall a court-ordered end to the practice.
Ms. Murphy's path to victory was heavily dependent on the institutional support she had amassed from Democratic leaders in the state's most populous urban counties, and the lawsuit directly undermined her campaign.
Mr. Menendez, 70, announced on Thursday that he would not run for re-election as a Democrat in June's primary. But Mr. Menendez, who has pleaded not guilty to all 16 charges he faces, left open the possibility of competing in November as an independent -- stoking fear among some Democratic leaders that he could siphon votes from their nominee and give Republicans an advantage.
It has been 50 years since New Jersey elected a Republican senator, and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state by nearly one million voters.
But Democrats hoping to retain their slim majority in the Senate have also indicated that there was no room for error, a reality Ms. Murphy seemed to acknowledge in the three-minute video she released on Sunday.
"As we face grave, dangerous threats on the national level, thanks to Donald Trump and far-right extremists," she said, "it's time to unify, not divide."

Menendez Says He Won't Run As a Democrat: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey faces federal bribery charges. His trial is scheduled to begin in May.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey announced on Thursday that he would not run for re-election as a Democrat this year, bowing to intense political pressure and federal charges that place him at the center of an international bribery scheme.
But in a nine-minute video posted on social media, Mr. Menendez, 70, reiterated that he would not resign and left the door open to running as a political independent if he is exonerated at a trial scheduled for May.
"I am hopeful that my exoneration will take place this summer and allow me to pursue my candidacy as an independent Democrat in the general election," he said.
Still, Mr. Menendez's decision to forgo the competition for his party's nomination amounted to a painful concession, after months of near total defiance, that his political career was teetering on the edge.
He was all but certain to lose the June primary for his own seat. Nearly every Democratic ally has abandoned him in recent months, and two prominent Democrats -- Representative Andy Kim and Tammy Murphy, the wife of Gov. Philip D. Murphy -- are trouncing him in primary polls.
The video included a lengthy and somber recitation of his legislative victories and leadership after catastrophic events like Hurricane Sandy and Sept. 11, as if aware that he was running out of chances to remind constituents of his decades of service in Washington.
"Unfortunately, the present accusations I am facing -- of which I am innocent and will prove so -- will not allow me to have that kind of political dialogue and debate with political opponents who have already made it a cornerstone of their campaign," he said in the video on Thursday.
A campaign as an independent against his own party's political organization is unlikely to be any easier, even if he were to prevail in court. It could also jeopardize Democrats' already tenuous hold on the Senate if he siphons votes from the Democratic nominee in a close race.
Mr. Menendez has until early June to decide whether to formally pursue an independent campaign. But former allies speculated that his motivation for preserving that possibility may have as much to do with his legal fight as it does with politics: Remaining a potential candidate allows him to continue raising money to pay the lawyers representing him and his wife, Nadine Menendez.
The senator had already spent $ 2.3 million from his campaign account on legal fees from October through December, federal filings show. He has spent at least $ 295,000 more from a separate legal defense fund. Those costs are likely to spike in the weeks ahead as his trial approaches.
Mr. Menendez's legal troubles have been a nonstop distraction since September when he and Ms. Menendez were charged in an elaborate bribery scheme. Hours before Mr. Menendez's announcement, his wife appeared in federal court in Manhattan for a hearing on whether her lawyers would be precluded from representing her at trial because of a potential conflict of interest.
Mr. Menendez's daughter, Alicia Menendez, a news anchor on MSNBC, was on the air, filling in as the host of "Deadline: White House," when details about her father's announcement began to spread.
It was the latest twist in the slow-motion collapse of a man who just six months ago was seen as among the most powerful political figures in New Jersey and a leading national voice on foreign policy and immigration issues.
Mr. Menendez effectively outran the law for decades as he rose from mayor of his hometown, Union City, to one of the country's first Cuban American members of Congress. He avoided charges in one federal criminal inquiry. Then, after being indicted in 2015 on separate bribery charges, he avoided conviction two years later when the trial ended in a hung jury and the government dropped the case after the judge dismissed the most serious charges.
The case was costly nonetheless. Mr. Menendez spent more than $ 5 million on lawyers, and a little-known challenger got nearly 40 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary the next year. Party leaders rallied behind Mr. Menendez in the general election, and he defeated his well-funded Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, by 11 percentage points.
Mr. Menendez insisted that history could repeat itself when federal prosecutors in Manhattan initiated the latest round of charges in September. But longtime allies who had stood by him through his earlier travails concluded that this case was different and cut their ties to him.
In July, before the charges were announced, John F.X. Graham, a New Jersey insurance executive and member of the Democratic National Committee, donated $ 10,000 to Mr. Menendez's defense fund.
But Mr. Graham said in an interview this week that he felt "betrayed and disappointed" after the details of the government's case against Mr. Menendez emerged.
He said he had told Mr. Menendez's fund-raising consultant that he would never again contribute. In response, he said he got a handwritten note from the senator assuring him he would "beat this thing."
"Bob Menendez's career is over," said Mr. Graham, who believes Mr. Menendez should resign. "It's that simple and he just hasn't admitted it to himself yet."
An initial indictment last fall said Mr. Menendez and his wife had conspired with others to accept gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz convertible and other lavish bribes in exchange for using his position as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to aid a foreign power, Egypt, and throttle two criminal investigations in New Jersey.
The charging papers included photos of the gold, wads of cash and the Mercedes, all of which were found during a search of the senator's home.
In the months since then, prosecutors have added more than a dozen charges, accusing Mr. Menendez and his wife of plotting to have him act as a foreign agent, taking steps to aid another foreign nation, Qatar, and obstructing justice.
The couple and two other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all counts. But a fifth defendant, a former New Jersey insurance broker, pleaded guilty this month to trying to bribe the couple with the Mercedes. In a setback for the senator's defense, the former broker, Jose Uribe, has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
Mr. Menendez, a skilled and pugnacious political fighter, has accused those prosecutors of being overzealous and trying to smear him, making his case directly to fellow senators and voters. His lawyers argue that the indictment criminalizes normal legislative activity and flouts constitutional protections afforded to members of Congress.
Those arguments may prevail in court, but they have had little effect on the voters, Democratic officials and even some members of his own staff who would have helped determine his political fate.
Nearly 75 percent of New Jersey voters disapprove of Mr. Menendez's Senate performance, a recent Monmouth University poll found -- roughly the same percentage that consider him guilty.
In Washington, Mr. Menendez has been urged to resign by more than half of the Senate's Democrats. His longtime political adviser and some key congressional staff members quit.
Back at home, if he remains on the ballot in November, he will most likely face either Mr. Kim or Ms. Murphy, who are locked in a highly competitive race for the Democratic nomination.
There are several Republican primary contenders, including a mayor and a former television reporter, both of whom have endorsed former President Donald J. Trump as the party's standard-bearer this year, and a hotel developer from the Jersey Shore who has been critical of Mr. Trump.
Ms. Murphy said that Mr. Menendez's decision to remain in office and, potentially, in the race showed that he continued "to place himself ahead of what's best for New Jerseyans and the Democratic Party as a whole."
Mr. Kim, 41, warned that Democrats' slim majority in the Senate was "on the line," and said that he would be the stronger candidate in November should Mr. Menendez enter the race and draw votes from the Democratic nominee.

Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., announced Thursday that he would not run for reelection as a Democrat this year, bowing to intense political pressure and federal charges that place him at the center of an international bribery scheme.
But in a nine-minute video posted on social media, Menendez, 70, reiterated that he would not resign and he left the door open to running as a political independent if he is exonerated at a trial scheduled for May.
“I am hopeful that my exoneration will take place this summer and allow me to pursue my candidacy as an independent Democrat in the general election,” he said.
Still, Menendez’s decision to forgo the competition for his party’s nomination amounted to a painful concession, after months of near total defiance, that his political career was teetering on the edge.

The Burden of Being the Famous Child of an Embattled Senator: [National Desk]

Full text: Alicia Menendez is a weekend anchor on MSNBC. Her brother, Rob, is a member of Congress. The bribery scandal surrounding their father has cast a long shadow.
It was the night before federal prosecutors would reveal explosive bribery charges against Senator Robert Menendez, and his adult children appeared unaware of the news storm that was about to hit the family.
Alicia and Rob Menendez seemed to be in great spirits at a glitzy political gala celebrating a new generation of Latino leaders.
Ms. Menendez, an increasingly high-profile anchor on the cable news network MSNBC, stood before a room filled with Latino politicians, media executives and entertainment figures, as the emcee of the annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute party in Washington.
Among those in attendance was her brother, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey who is in his first term representing a majority Hispanic district, a seat once held by his father.
In her opening remarks that evening last fall, Ms. Menendez exuded confidence, poise and glamour. The event was a triumph for the Menendezes, who hammed it up in selfies that Ms. Menendez shared the following morning.
"So fun to host @chcidc's 46th Annual Awards Gala," she wrote on Instagram. "Sibling time was a bonus."
The Menendezes have surely enjoyed the privileges of being children of a powerful political leader. But the very next day, they began to confront -- not for the first time -- a corollary dynamic: the anguish and embarrassment of having their father accused of public corruption.
Amid heart emojis in praise of her performance the night before, Ms. Menendez's Instagram feed became littered with comments like "How corrupt is your family?" and "Your dad's going to the gallows."
Since then, the drama has been relentless. Just this month, new developments have underscored the gravity of the case against the Menendezes' father, who, with his wife, Nadine Menendez, is accused of accepting bribes of gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for an array of political favors.
After a former ally pleaded guilty and began cooperating with prosecutors, Senator Menendez and Nadine Menendez were additionally charged with obstructing justice. Both have pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Alicia and Rob Menendez used to be game to talk publicly about their father, joking about his penchant for playing Super Mario Bros., his love of musical theater -- "Wicked" is his favorite show, they said in a 2011 campaign ad -- and his bragging about being on the varsity bowling team in high school.
These days, they are understandably less eager to talk about him. But their desire for privacy is complicated by the fact that they too are public figures who cannot, without sacrificing their own careers, avoid a public spotlight.
Rob Menendez, 38, is fighting for political survival in a Democratic primary that falls less than a month after the day his father's trial is expected to start, May 6. The men share a name, and Senator Menendez has not ruled out running for re-election -- leaving open the possibility that both could appear on the same ballot and confuse voters.
Alicia Menendez, 40, has been forced to address the charges against her father -- and calls for his resignation -- on live television.
The legal drama has unfolded in parallel with important events in the siblings' own careers. Earlier this month, a judge ordered Senator Menendez and his wife back to court just as Alicia and Rob were preparing for President Biden's State of the Union address -- Alicia would be contributing to MSNBC's live coverage of the event, and Rob would be in attendance, a member of the congressional assembly.
Friends and colleagues say that it is a challenging time emotionally and professionally for Alicia and Rob Menendez, both of whom declined through spokesmen to comment for this article.
They are unlikely -- however unfair it may be -- to escape the stigma of the allegations against their father, said Sally Quinn, the longtime Washington Post writer who does not know the Menendezes but has observed the familial fallout of political scandal from the Nixons to the Clintons to the Cuomos to the Trumps.
"When your close loved one is at the center of a political scandal," she said, "it's in your obit too."
'A quick break'
On the afternoon of Jan. 2, Alicia Menendez was sitting in the most high-profile seat of her career, filling in for Nicolle Wallace on the highly rated MSNBC news show "Deadline: White House."
She was conducting a live interview with an airline safety consultant when she abruptly ended the conversation. "We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back with some breaking news right after this," she said.
Seconds later, Ms. Menendez was gone, and a colleague was on the air in her place. "Hello, I'm Ari Melber with some breaking legal news," he said. "New Jersey United States Senator Robert Menendez now facing new allegations in a second superseding indictment."
Ms. Menendez's quick exit that day was part of a promise she had made to viewers months earlier, when her father was first indicted.
"I have been watching along with all of you as a citizen, and also as his daughter," she said on the air in September. "I will not be reporting on the legal case."
In the past, she has described herself as someone who cries easily, but that day she betrayed no emotion. She concluded by saying that her colleagues would continue to cover the story, "as they should."
Asked if MSNBC was troubled by the complications of Ms. Menendez's connection to the subject of a significant political scandal, a spokesman for the network declined to comment or to make available any of her colleagues, producers or bosses to discuss her work.
Ms. Menendez has been grappling with the realities of being a politician's daughter for years. "You can't have a private life as an elected official," she told The Washington Post in 2013. "It's not a family-friendly institution."
She and her brother were raised in Union City, N.J., a densely packed city in northern New Jersey that for decades has been a hub of immigrant life. Their father is the child of Cuban immigrants, and their mother, Jane Jacobsen, is of Irish-German-Norwegian descent -- a "gringa," as Alicia wrote in a 2012 essay. She said that Ms. Jacobsen helped to instill in her children a strong Latino identity, even if they did not speak Spanish. (Their parents divorced in 2005.)
When she and her brother were young, their mother was a teacher and guidance counselor, and the family lived in an apartment above their father's law firm. "He was terrible at making money," Ms. Menendez told The Washington Post.
Mr. Menendez became mayor of Union City and was elected to Congress when Alicia was 9. She spent "Take Your Daughter to Work" days at the Capitol. Though Mr. Menendez traveled frequently to Washington, he remained a demanding figure. "Dad was an original tiger mom," she told The New York Times in 2015.
Ms. Menendez landed at Harvard University, class of 2005. She majored in women's studies, was the president of an elite "final club" and considered herself an "ethnically ambiguous feminist," she said in a 2004 article in The Harvard Crimson.
Her ambitions were set on politics. She worked for Jon Corzine's New Jersey gubernatorial campaign (when Mr. Corzine won, he appointed then-Representative Robert Menendez to his seat in the U.S. Senate). And she managed the campaigns of peers running for Harvard student government, including Rohit Chopra, now director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
"She really could sell a pork chop to a rabbi," Mr. Chopra said, describing Ms. Menendez's political skills to The Crimson in 2004.
She worked in television production and progressive politics, eventually focusing on media. She appeared on HuffPost Live, Fusion and PBS before landing at MSNBC in 2019.
She is also the host of a podcast, "Latina to Latina," a weekly interview show, now in its sixth year. As an interviewer, "she has this ability to bring people to the point of self-discovery," said Juleyka Lantigua, who owns and produces the podcast with Ms. Menendez.
At MSNBC, she was the solo anchor of the network's "American Voices" program, which first aired in 2020, and is now one of three anchors on "The Weekend," with Michael Steele and Symone D. Sanders Townsend.
Ms. Menendez is a go-to source of support and strategy for friends, said Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and immigrant rights activist.
Before Mr. Vargas, who was born in the Philippines, revealed himself to be an undocumented immigrant in a 2011 New York Times Magazine story, he turned to Ms. Menendez for advice. He stayed on her couch in her Washington apartment, and she prepared him to answer tough questions from the public and from TV personalities like Bill O'Reilly. "She is the kind of person that you want in a crisis," Mr. Vargas said.
(Ms. Menendez has interviewed Mr. Vargas on her news shows, as she has other friends, including Mr. Chopra, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, who declined to comment.)
In a crisis of her own, Ms. Menendez has maintained her composure, Mr. Vargas said. Last fall, she joined him for a Broadway performance of "Here Lies Love," a play he helped to produce. It was the first time he had seen her since her father was first indicted.
"How are you holding up?" he asked her.
"I am OK," he said she told him, in a manner that didn't invite further questions. "I can tell from the way she looked at me that that was all I could ask."
'His father's umbrella'
While Alicia Menendez has seemingly found a way to keep the bribery scandal at arm's length, it has been more difficult for her brother, whose career is more overtly tied to their father.
Two years ago, Rob Menendez announced he would run for his father's former congressional seat, and he was instantly embraced by a cadre of powerful New Jersey politicians, essentially guaranteeing him a win in the heavily Democratic district. He traded a job at a law firm where he was earning $ 456,000 a year for a seat in Washington and a commuter marriage -- something his father cautioned, from experience, would be a strain on his wife and two young children, according to a confidant of both men.
He has since focused heavily on constituent services and sought to carve out a bipartisan policy niche. It is an effort driven by a desire to prove his mettle and to dispatch the whispers that he is in Congress only because he was anointed, according to interviews with more than a dozen colleagues, constituents and friends.
"He has really made strides to get out from under -- from the beginning -- his father's umbrella," said Jimmy Davis, the mayor of Bayonne, N.J., one of the largest cities in the congressional district. "His thing was to make his mark and to set his own legacy."
But even as he tries to chart his own course, he appears intent on remaining the same loyal son who, at 32 years old, was the first witness called by his father's defense team during an unrelated 2017 corruption trial that ended with a hung jury.
In September, after Senator Menendez was again charged with accepting bribes, a cascade of prominent Democrats in New Jersey began calling for the senator's resignation.
Rob Menendez has not.
"He's my father," he said in a recent interview on PBS, by way of explanation.
"In a situation where a family member is going through a challenge, you support them," he added, noting that "everybody deserves their shot in court to present their case."
But there is little doubt that his father's legal troubles have cast a shadow on Rob Menendez's re-election effort.
In a state where party bosses can tamp down most viable primary challenges, particularly for popular incumbents, he is locked in a spirited contest for the Democratic nomination with the mayor of Hoboken, Ravi Bhalla.
Unlike in his first race in 2022, Rob Menendez struggled to raise money last year; as of January Mr. Bhalla had raised three times as much for the June 4 primary. Senator Menendez's trial is scheduled to take place in the weeks before the election, creating a potential public-relations disaster for his son.
"Clearly it is a horrible situation, and he doesn't deny that," said Bill Matsikoudis, a political supporter and friend. The congressman's strategy, Mr. Matsikoudis said, was to "double down on his work in the capital" and to be omnipresent in the district.
"I've seen some pretty impressive maturity, actually," Mr. Matsikoudis said.
But in late January, a social media feud flared between Mr. Menendez and Mr. Bhalla that vividly demonstrated his vulnerabilities.
Mr. Bhalla called Mr. Menendez the "entitled son of corrupt Bob 'Gold Bar' Menendez." Mr. Menendez said Mr. Bhalla's "posturing" about ending machine politics in New Jersey "was as believable as Donald Trump being a stable genius."
Each campaign has since released an internal poll that showed their candidate had the edge, and Democratic strategists expect the election to be close.
"Rob came out of the gate already swinging," said Hector Oseguera, a left-leaning Democrat who competed in 2020 for the seat Rob Menendez now holds and has been following the race closely. "That says he's concerned."

New Clean Air Rules Will Still Propel Manufacturers to Sell More Electric Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: New Biden administration auto rules are less forceful than an earlier proposal but will still add to market pressure for cheaper electric vehicles.
Even if clean air rules announced on Wednesday in Washington are less forceful than some environmentalists would have liked, they should still have a powerful effect on the kinds of cars appearing in showrooms over the next several years, experts said.
The rules will amplify market forces pushing the industry toward battery power, giving automakers a strong incentive to sell a broader, more affordable variety of electric cars -- not just the expensive sport utility vehicles that have dominated sales so far.
"It probably means more models and lower prices," said Craig Segall, former deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board, an agency that played a key role in promoting electric vehicles in that state. "The way you win," he said, referring to carmakers, "is making sure you have an E.V. in each segment."
Despite talk of a slowdown, sales of electric vehicles are growing much faster than sales of vehicles that run on fossil fuels. Prices of electric vehicles have dropped significantly and are likely to fall further as carmakers get better at making them and the cost of batteries and raw materials plummets.
The Environmental Protection Agency rules announced Wednesday "certainly don't slow down the pace at which our members are scaling up production," said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. The association's members include Tesla and other electric carmakers, as well as battery manufacturers, charging companies and suppliers.
The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats in 2022, led to a boom in investment in battery factories and electric vehicle plants. Since then, companies have announced investments of more than $ 110 billion in battery factories and electric vehicle assembly plants, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. These are long-term financial commitments that companies are likely to stick to regardless of what the federal government does.
Within a few years, electric cars that can drive more than 300 miles on a charge are likely to cost less than gasoline vehicles even before accounting for fuel savings. Electricity is usually much cheaper than gasoline. That will give more car buyers strong economic reasons to go electric.
The average price of a new electric vehicle has fallen substantially. It was $ 52,314 in February, according to Kelley Blue Book, still about $ 5,000 more than the average for all vehicles. But electric vehicle prices plummeted 13 percent in February from a year earlier, and more than $ 2,500 just from January. The cost of used battery-powered vehicles has dropped much more than that.
Prices will to continue to fall steeply because batteries, the most important and expensive component, are becoming much cheaper, analysts say. The average cost of a battery pack is on track to plunge more than 40 percent by 2030 compared with 2022, according to estimates by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization.
Electric vehicles "are getting closer to parity with gas cars," said Katherine García, a transportation expert at the Sierra Club. "We are going to see that sooner than originally forecast."
During the early years of the E.P.A. rules announced on Wednesday, automakers will face somewhat less pressure to cut emissions than under an earlier agency proposal. The E.P.A. doesn't dictate to automakers how they meet the standards. They can also reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of gasoline engines or by selling more hybrid cars that augment gasoline engines with batteries and electric motors.
Plug-in hybrids, which can travel short distances on battery power alone and are growing in popularity, could proliferate during the next few years. They will account for as much as 9 percent of new car sales by 2030, according to E.P.A. estimates, compared with about 2 percent last year.
But automakers will get the most credit for all-electric cars that have no tailpipe emissions. They will account for 44 percent of new cars by 2030, according to the E.P.A.
Longer term, most automakers acknowledge that they need to sell appealing electric vehicles to survive.
"E.V.s are clearly the future and what consumers are going to be wanting and what's going to be cheapest to produce," said Stephanie Searle, chief program officer at the International Council on Clean Transportation. "Automakers need to be investing in that to keep up."
Tesla has already shaken the car market and has become the world's most valuable automaker. New competitors from China are looming, as Beijing tries to take advantage of the technological shift to become a major auto exporter.
Tariffs and other restrictions have limited Chinese exports to the United States so far. But automakers like BYD, which sells an electric car in China for less than $ 12,000, could find a way in by producing in Mexico or even building factories in the United States.
For automakers, the emergence of Chinese rivals is a powerful motivator. It evokes unpleasant memories of the way Toyota, Honda and other Japanese automakers broke the dominance of Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler in the 1970s with inexpensive, fuel-efficient cars. Tesla, Ford and Volkswagen are among the major automakers working on low-cost electric vehicles that are clearly inspired by the threat from China.
Experience has shown that technology often moves faster than regulations require. Under E.P.A. rules that took effect in 2017, electric vehicles were expected to account for 3 percent of new car sales by 2025. But battery-powered cars are already at about 8 percent of the U.S. new car market.
In California, which has long had the strictest pollution limits, electric cars made up 25 percent of new cars sold last year. And under rules passed in 2022, the state will phase out cars that burn fossil fuels by 2035.
"California has more than its share of E.V.s because we asked for it," said Mr. Segall, the former state official, who is now vice president of Evergreen, an activist group.
Another 12 states, including New York and New Jersey, model their rules on California's and won't be affected much by E.P.A. regulations because their rules are already stricter. The federal rules will have the most impact on states like Texas, Florida and Connecticut that don't follow California.
The rules will also put pressure on carmakers like Toyota and Stellantis, the owner of Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, which have been slow to sell fully electric vehicles.
The E.P.A. rules are among numerous Biden administration policies intended to promote electric vehicles. Tax credits of up to $ 7,500 are available for vehicles that are manufactured in the United States, Canada or Mexico and meet other requirements designed to promote a domestic supply chain. The number of vehicles that qualify is small, but is expected to grow as carmakers like Hyundai make more vehicles in the United States.
The government is also subsidizing construction of fast-charging stations, which along with investments by carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and charging companies like Electrify America will soon remove a major sticking point for many car buyers.
Surveys show that many people are interested in electric cars but are worried about finding a place to charge on road trips. If governments and companies follow through on all the plans they have announced, according to a study published this month by the International Council on Clean Transportation, by 2030 there will be more than enough fast chargers.

With Robert Menendez Indicted, His Children Feel Spotlight’s Glare

Full text: Enlarge this image.
It was the night before federal prosecutors would reveal explosive bribery charges against Sen. Robert Menendez, and his adult children appeared unaware of the news storm that was about to hit the family.
Alicia and Rob Menendez seemed to be in great spirits at a glitzy political gala celebrating a new generation of Latino leaders.
Alicia Menendez, an increasingly high-profile anchor on the cable news network MSNBC, stood before a room filled with Latino politicians, media executives and entertainment figures, as the emcee of the annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute party in Washington.
Among those in attendance was her brother, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey who is in his first term representing a majority Hispanic district, a seat once held by his father.
In her opening remarks that evening last fall, Alicia Menendez exuded confidence, poise and glamour. The event was a triumph for the Menendezes, who hammed it up in selfies that Alicia Menendez shared the following morning.
“So fun to host @chcidc’s 46th Annual Awards Gala,” she wrote on Instagram. “Sibling time was a bonus.”
The Menendezes have surely enjoyed the privileges of being children of a powerful political leader. But the very next day, they began to confront — not for the first time — a corollary dynamic: the anguish and embarrassment of having their father accused of public corruption.
Amid heart emojis in praise of her performance the night before, Alicia Menendez’s Instagram feed became littered with comments like “How corrupt is your family?” and “Your dad’s going to the gallows.”
Since then, the drama has been relentless. Just this month, new developments have underscored the gravity of the case against the Menendezes’ father, who, with his wife, Nadine Menendez, is accused of accepting bribes of gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for an array of political favors.
After a former ally pleaded guilty and began cooperating with prosecutors, Menendez and Nadine Menendez were additionally charged with obstructing justice. Both have pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Alicia and Rob Menendez used to be game to talk publicly about their father, joking about his penchant for playing Super Mario Bros., his love of musical theater — “Wicked” is his favorite show, they said in a 2011 campaign ad — and his bragging about being on the varsity bowling team in high school.
These days, they are understandably less eager to talk about him. But their desire for privacy is complicated by the fact that they too are public figures who cannot, without sacrificing their own careers, avoid a public spotlight.
Rob Menendez, 38, is fighting for political survival in a Democratic primary that falls less than a month after the day his father’s trial is expected to start, May 6. The men share a name, and Robert Menendez has not ruled out running for reelection — leaving open the possibility that both could appear on the same ballot and confuse voters.
Alicia Menendez, 40, has been forced to address the charges against her father — and calls for his resignation — on live television.
The legal drama has unfolded in parallel with important events in the siblings’ own careers. Earlier this month, a judge ordered Robert Menendez and his wife back to court just as Alicia and Rob were preparing for President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address — Alicia would be contributing to MSNBC’s live coverage of the event, and Rob would be in attendance, a member of the congressional assembly.
Friends and colleagues say that it is a challenging time emotionally and professionally for Alicia and Rob Menendez, both of whom declined through spokespeople to comment for this article.
They are unlikely — however unfair it may be — to escape the stigma of the allegations against their father, said Sally Quinn, the longtime Washington Post writer who does not know the Menendezes but has observed the familial fallout of political scandal from the Nixons to the Clintons to the Cuomos to the Trumps.
“When your close loved one is at the center of a political scandal,” she said, “it’s in your obit too.”
‘A quick break’
On the afternoon of Jan. 2, Alicia Menendez was sitting in the most high-profile seat of her career, filling in for Nicolle Wallace on the highly rated MSNBC news show, “Deadline: White House.”
She was conducting a live interview with an airline safety consultant when she abruptly ended the conversation. “We’re going to take a quick break, and we’ll be back with some breaking news right after this,” she said.
Seconds later, Alicia Menendez was gone, and a colleague was on the air in her place. “Hello, I’m Ari Melber with some breaking legal news,” he said. “New Jersey United States Senator Robert Menendez now facing new allegations in a second superseding indictment.”
Alicia Menendez’s quick exit that day was part of a promise she had made to viewers months earlier, when her father was first indicted.
“I have been watching along with all of you as a citizen, and also as his daughter,” she said on the air in September. “I will not be reporting on the legal case.”
In the past, she has described herself as someone who cries easily, but that day she betrayed no emotion. She concluded by saying that her colleagues would continue to cover the story, “as they should.”
Asked if MSNBC was troubled by the complications of Alicia Menendez’s connection to the subject of a significant political scandal, a spokesperson for the network declined to comment or to make available any of her colleagues, producers or bosses to discuss her work.
Alicia Menendez has been grappling with the realities of being a politician’s daughter for years. “You can’t have a private life as an elected official,” she told The Washington Post in 2013. “It’s not a family-friendly institution.”
She and her brother were raised in Union City, New Jersey, a densely packed city that for decades has been a hub of immigrant life. Their father is the child of Cuban immigrants, and their mother, Jane Jacobsen, is of Irish-German-Norwegian descent — a “gringa,” as Alicia wrote in a 2012 essay. She said that Jacobsen helped to instill in her children a strong Latino identity, even if they did not speak Spanish. (Their parents divorced in 2005.)
When she and her brother were young, their mother was a teacher and guidance counselor, and the family lived in an apartment above their father’s law firm. “He was terrible at making money,” Alicia Menendez told The Washington Post.
Robert Menendez became mayor of Union City and was elected to Congress when Alicia was 9. She spent “Take Your Daughter to Work” days at the Capitol. Though Menendez traveled frequently to Washington, he remained a demanding figure. “Dad was an original tiger mom,” she told The New York Times in 2015.
Alicia Menendez landed at Harvard University, class of 2005. She majored in women’s studies, was the president of an elite “final club” and considered herself an “ethnically ambiguous feminist,” she said in a 2004 article in The Harvard Crimson.
Her ambitions were set on politics. She worked for Jon Corzine’s New Jersey gubernatorial campaign (when Corzine won, he appointed then-Rep. Robert Menendez to his seat in the U.S. Senate). And she managed the campaigns of peers running for Harvard student government, including Rohit Chopra, now director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“She really could sell a pork chop to a rabbi,” Chopra said, describing Alicia Menendez’s political skills to The Crimson in 2004.
She worked in television production and progressive politics, eventually focusing on media. She appeared on HuffPost Live, Fusion and PBS before landing at MSNBC in 2019.
She is also the host of a podcast, “Latina to Latina,” a weekly interview show, now in its sixth year. As an interviewer, “she has this ability to bring people to the point of self-discovery,” said Juleyka Lantigua, who owns and produces the podcast with Alicia Menendez.
At MSNBC, she was the solo anchor of the network’s “American Voices” program, which first aired in 2020, and is now one of three anchors on “The Weekend,” with Michael Steele and Symone D. Sanders Townsend.
Alicia Menendez is a go-to source of support and strategy for friends, said Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and immigrant rights activist.
Before Vargas, who was born in the Philippines, revealed himself to be an undocumented immigrant in a 2011 New York Times Magazine story, he turned to Alicia Menendez for advice. He stayed on her couch in her Washington apartment, and she prepared him to answer tough questions from the public and from TV personalities like Bill O’Reilly. “She is the kind of person that you want in a crisis,” Vargas said.
In a crisis of her own, Alicia Menendez has maintained her composure, Vargas said. Last fall, she joined him for a Broadway performance of “Here Lies Love,” a play he helped to produce. It was the first time he had seen her since her father was first indicted.
“How are you holding up?” he asked her.
“I am OK,” he said she told him, in a manner that didn’t invite further questions. “I can tell from the way she looked at me that that was all I could ask.”
‘His father’s umbrella’
While Alicia Menendez has seemingly found a way to keep the bribery scandal at arm’s length, it has been more difficult for her brother, whose career is more overtly tied to their father.
Two years ago, Rob Menendez announced he would run for his father’s former congressional seat, and he was instantly embraced by a cadre of powerful New Jersey politicians, essentially guaranteeing him a win in the heavily Democratic district. He traded a job at a law firm where he was earning $456,000 a year for a seat in Washington and a commuter marriage — something his father cautioned, from experience, would be a strain on his wife and two young children, according to a confidant of both men.
He has since focused heavily on constituent services and sought to carve out a bipartisan policy niche. It is an effort driven by a desire to prove his mettle and to dispatch the whispers that he is in Congress only because he was anointed, according to interviews with more than a dozen colleagues, constituents and friends.
“He has really made strides to get out from under — from the beginning — his father’s umbrella,” said Jimmy Davis, the mayor of Bayonne, New Jersey, one of the largest cities in the congressional district. “His thing was to make his mark and to set his own legacy.”
But even as he tries to chart his own course, he appears intent on remaining the same loyal son who, at 32 years old, was the first witness called by his father’s defense team during an unrelated 2017 corruption trial that ended with a hung jury.
In September, after Robert Menendez was again charged with accepting bribes, a cascade of prominent Democrats in New Jersey began calling for the senator’s resignation.
Rob Menendez has not.
“He’s my father,” he said in a recent interview on PBS, by way of explanation.
“In a situation where a family member is going through a challenge, you support them,” he added, noting that “everybody deserves their shot in court to present their case.”
But there is little doubt that his father’s legal troubles have cast a shadow on Rob Menendez’s reelection effort.
In a state where party bosses can tamp down most viable primary challenges, particularly for popular incumbents, he is locked in a spirited contest for the Democratic nomination with the mayor of Hoboken, Ravi Bhalla.
Unlike in his first race in 2022, Rob Menendez struggled to raise money last year; as of January Bhalla had raised three times as much for the June 4 primary. Robert Menendez’s trial is scheduled to take place in the weeks before the election, creating a potential public-relations disaster for his son.
“Clearly it is a horrible situation, and he doesn’t deny that,” said Bill Matsikoudis, a political supporter and friend. The congressman’s strategy, Matsikoudis said, was to “double down on his work in the capital” and to be omnipresent in the district.
“I’ve seen some pretty impressive maturity, actually,” Matsikoudis said.
But in late January, a social media feud flared between Rob Menendez and Bhalla that vividly demonstrated his vulnerabilities.
Bhalla called Rob Menendez the “entitled son of corrupt Bob ‘Gold Bar’ Menendez.” Rob Menendez said Bhalla’s “posturing” about ending machine politics in New Jersey “was as believable as Donald Trump being a stable genius.”
Each campaign has since released an internal poll that showed their candidate had the edge, and Democratic strategists expect the election to be close.
“Rob came out of the gate already swinging,” said Hector Oseguera, a left-leaning Democrat who competed in 2020 for the seat Rob Menendez now holds and has been following the race closely. “That says he’s concerned.”

VW Workers Request Vote To Unionize in Tennessee: [Correction]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers said a "supermajority" of the 4,000 eligible workers at a Volkswagen factory had signed cards backing the union.
Volkswagen employees in Tennessee who are hoping to join the United Automobile Workers asked a federal agency on Monday to hold an election, a key step toward the union's longtime goal of organizing nonunion factories across the South.
The union said Volkswagen workers had filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking for a unionization vote after a "supermajority" of the 4,000 eligible workers at the plant had signed cards supporting the U.A.W.
It did not specify how many workers had signed cards, but it previously advised workers to get the support of more than 70 percent of hourly workers and establish a robust organizing committee before seeking an election. A simple majority vote is needed to win representation.
"Today, we are one step closer to making a good job at Volkswagen into a great career," Isaac Meadows, an assembly worker at the plant, said in a statement issued by the union.
An election at the factory would be the first test of the U.A.W.'s strength after the union staged a wave of strikes in the fall against the three Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis -- and winning record wage increases -- with encouragement from the Biden administration.
In a statement on Monday, Volkswagen said it would "fully support" an election giving every employee a chance to vote on union representation. "We respect our workers' right to a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests," the company said.
Later Monday, President Biden issued a statement congratulating the Volkswagen workers for filing for the union election.
The U.A.W. has been hoping to use momentum from its bargaining with the Detroit-based manufacturers to organize nonunion plants in Southern states that pay significantly lower wages than union factories. The U.A.W. says it plans to spend $ 40 million over the next three years on its campaign.
Chattanooga workers have voted on U.A.W. representation twice before, and slim majorities rejected unionization each time. In a 2014 vote, the union had no opposition from Volkswagen management, but there was vocal resistance from state Republican leaders, who suggested that unionizing would jeopardize expansion and job growth at the plant. A second narrow loss came in 2019.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W. was in a strong position to gain a majority this time.
"Now they have a lot more support from legislators, the public and the president," he said. "They can say, 'We can help you get better wages and benefits, and we proved we could do that with the Big Three."'
Over the last 40 years, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and other foreign-owned automakers have built more than two dozen auto plants across the South and the lower Midwest, drawn by right-to-work laws that make it harder for unions to organize workers.
They also often chose to build factories in rural areas where prevailing wages are significantly lower than in Michigan and other Northern states.
In addition to the Volkswagen effort, union campaigns are underway at a Mercedes-Benz plant and a Hyundai factory, both in Alabama. The union says more than half of the Mercedes workers and more than 30 percent of the Hyundai workers have signed cards supporting U.A.W. membership.
Volkswagen workers said they wanted to join the U.A.W. to push for higher wages, more time off and improved safety measures. The Chattanooga factory opened in 2011 and makes the Atlas full-size sport utility vehicle and the ID.4 electric vehicle. It is the world's only Volkswagen plant without union representation.
"VW has partnered with unionized work forces around the world to make their plants safe and successful," Victor Vaughn, a logistics worker, said in the union statement. "That's why we're voting for a voice at Volkswagen here in Chattanooga."
The U.A.W. is likely to have support in the election from the powerful German labor union, IG Metall. Under German law, worker representatives occupy half of the seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
The U.A.W. has sought for years to organize these nonunion auto plants without success, but unions have had a resurgence in recent years in organizing efforts and contract showdowns.
G.M., Ford and Stellantis agreed in the fall to roughly 25 percent wage increases for workers making the top U.A.W. wage, and even larger raises for workers farther down on the pay scale.
Within a few years, almost all of the 146,000 U.A.W. workers at the Detroit companies will earn more than $ 40 an hour -- the equivalent of about $ 83,000 a year for those working 40 hours a week.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11 percent pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three, bringing the top hourly wage for production workers to $ 32.40.
Nonunion auto plants generally start new workers at less than $ 20 an hour and pay a top wage under $ 30 an hour.

Volkswagen employees in Tennessee who are hoping to join the United Auto Workers asked a federal agency Monday to hold an election, a key step toward the union’s longtime goal of organizing nonunion factories across the South.
The union said Volkswagen workers had filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking for a unionization vote after a “supermajority” of the 4,000 eligible workers at the plant had signed cards supporting the UAW.
It did not specify how many workers had signed cards, but it previously advised workers to get the support of more than 70% of hourly workers and establish a robust organizing committee before seeking an election. A simple majority vote is needed to win representation.
“Today, we are one step closer to making a good job at Volkswagen into a great career,” Isaac Meadows, an assembly worker at the plant, said in a statement issued by the union.
An election at the factory would be the first test of the UAW’s strength after the union staged strikes in the fall against the three Detroit automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis — and winning record wage increases — with encouragement from the Biden administration.
In a statement Monday, Volkswagen said it would “fully support” an election giving every employee a chance to vote on union representation. “We respect our workers’ right to a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests,” the company said.
The UAW has been hoping to use momentum from its bargaining with the Detroit-based manufacturers to organize nonunion plants in Southern states that pay significantly lower wages than union factories. The UAW says it plans to spend $40 million over the next three years on its campaign.
Chattanooga workers have voted on UAW representation twice before, and slim majorities rejected unionization each time. In a 2014 vote, the union had no opposition from Volkswagen management, but there was vocal resistance from state Republican leaders, who suggested that unionizing would jeopardize expansion and job growth at the plant. A second narrow loss came in 2019.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the UAW was in a strong position to gain a majority this time.
“Now they have a lot more support from legislators, the public and the president,” he said. “They can say, ‘We can help you get better wages and benefits, and we proved we could do that with the Big Three.’ ”
Over the past 40 years, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and other foreign-owned automakers have built more than two dozen auto plants across the South and the lower Midwest, drawn by right-to-work laws that make it harder for unions to organize workers.
They also often chose to build factories in rural areas where prevailing wages are significantly lower than in Michigan and other Northern states.
In addition to the Volkswagen effort, union campaigns are underway at a Mercedes-Benz plant and a Hyundai factory, both in Alabama. The union says more than half of the Mercedes workers and more than 30% of the Hyundai workers have signed cards supporting UAW membership.
Volkswagen workers said they wanted to join the UAW to push for higher wages, more time off and improved safety measures. The Chattanooga factory opened in 2011 and makes the Atlas full-size SUV and the ID.4 electric vehicle. It is the world’s only Volkswagen plant without union representation.
“VW has partnered with unionized workforces around the world to make their plants safe and successful,” Victor Vaughn, a logistics worker, said in the union statement. “That’s why we’re voting for a voice at Volkswagen here in Chattanooga.”
The UAW is likely to have support in the election from the powerful German labor union, IG Metall, which under German law occupies half of the seats on Volkswagen’s supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
The UAW has sought for years to organize nonunion auto plants without success, but unions have had a resurgence in recent years in organizing efforts and contract showdowns.
GM, Ford and Stellantis agreed in the fall to roughly 25% wage increases for workers making the top UAW wage and even larger raises for workers further down on the pay scale.
Within a few years, almost all of the 146,000 UAW workers at the Detroit companies will earn more than $40 an hour — the equivalent of about $83,000 a year for those working 40 hours a week.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11% pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three, bringing the top hourly wage for production workers to $32.40.
Nonunion auto plants generally start new workers at less than $20 an hour and pay a top wage under $30 an hour.

Judge Refuses to Dismiss Charges Against Menendez, Rejecting His Immunity Claim: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey could appeal the ruling, which could end up delaying his trial for months.
A Manhattan judge refused on Thursday to dismiss bribery and other charges against Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, rejecting an argument that they violated constitutional protections afforded to members of Congress.
Mr. Menendez could appeal the judge's decision, which might end up delaying his trial for months. It currently is scheduled to begin on May 6.
The ruling does not address other grounds on which Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, is seeking dismissal of the charges.
The senator's lawyers had asked the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, to throw out the charges, arguing that overzealous prosecutors were criminalizing the normal activity of legislators and flouting the protections given to members of Congress under what is known as the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause.
Judge Stein, in his 17-page decision, rejected each of Mr. Menendez's arguments that the conduct cited by prosecutors as criminal was in fact protected legislative activity.
The ruling applied to two charges central to the indictment: that Mr. Menendez attempted to install a U.S. attorney in New Jersey who might be inclined to go easy on a friend accused of federal crimes, and that he steered weapons and aid to Egypt in return for bribes.
"The court finds that none of the allegations at issue concerning the U.S. attorney scheme or the Egyptian aid scheme are protected by the speech or debate clause," Judge Stein wrote.
Adam Fee, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, did not indicate whether the senator planned to appeal the decision, saying only that the senator and his lawyers were reviewing the ruling and considering their "legal options."
He called the indictment "a gross distortion of reality."
"We continue to have full confidence that a jury will see the truth: that Senator Menendez did nothing wrong," Mr. Fee said. "We look forward to proceeding to trial, where we intend to clear the name of this devoted lifelong public servant."
In October, Mr. Menendez, the former chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, became the first senator in U.S. history to be accused of plotting to be an agent of a foreign government -- a charge he strenuously rejects and asked the judge to dismiss.
Judge Stein refused, ruling that the behavior outlined in the indictment against Mr. Menendez -- including the sharing of sensitive information about Egyptian embassy staff members -- was not exempt from prosecution.
"Surely meetings with, and the provision of information to, Egyptian officials in relation to a corrupt bribery scheme must be viewed as occurring outside of the legislative process," Judge Stein wrote.
Similarly, regarding Mr. Menendez's effort to secure the nomination of a friendly U.S. attorney, the judge concluded that the "speech or debate" protection would apply to a senator's duty to offer advice and consent about a president's choice for federal prosecutor only after a person was nominated -- not before.
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to comment on the ruling.
The ruling is one of several recent setbacks for Mr. Menendez, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
On March 1, one of his co-defendants, Jose Uribe, a former New Jersey insurance broker, pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe the senator with a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors leading the bribery investigation. Within days, Mr. Menendez was charged in an updated indictment in which some of the new counts appeared related to information provided by Mr. Uribe.
Mr. Menendez's remaining co-defendants -- his wife, Nadine Menendez, and two New Jersey businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes -- have also pleaded not guilty.
Judge Stein also recently denied Mr. Menendez's motion to exclude evidence that his lawyers said was obtained through unconstitutional searches.
Lawyers for Mr. Menendez, in a recent court filing, raised the issue of a possible appeal -- perhaps on an expedited basis -- if the judge ruled against the senator on the "speech or debate" clause issue. It remains unclear, if an appeal were pursued, how quickly it might be resolved and for how long that could delay the trial.
Judge Stein acknowledged there are broad protections offered by the Constitution to shield members of Congress "from liability for their actions within the 'legislative sphere,' even though their conduct, if performed in other than legislative contexts, would in itself be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to criminal or civil statutes."
Still, he said that Mr. Menendez had "failed to meet his burden" of establishing that he was immune from prosecution.
If Mr. Menendez does go to trial, the case would be his second federal corruption trial in less than seven years. In 2017, Mr. Menendez avoided conviction in a federal corruption trial in New Jersey, which ended in a hung jury and dismissal of charges against him.

A Hybrid-First Strategy Is Paying Off for Toyota: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Toyota, the world's largest automaker, has been criticized for selling few electric vehicles, but its decision to focus on hybrids is paying off financially.
In today's high-tech, high-stakes auto industry, fortunes can change quickly, and there's no better example of that right now than Toyota Motor.
Not long ago, it looked as if Toyota had fallen dangerously behind in electric vehicles. Tesla, the electric car pioneer, has grown rapidly and become the world's most valuable automaker. Seeing Tesla's success, other companies, such as General Motors and Ford Motor, concluded that large numbers of consumers were poised to switch to battery-powered cars and trucks and began investing tens of billions of dollars to catch up.
Toyota, however, was more deliberate -- or lethargic, its critics would say. It has introduced just two fully electric models in the United States so far, betting that its gas-electric hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which it has become known for, would remain popular and were sufficient to address climate change for now.
Amid all the enthusiasm for electric vehicles in the last few years, it seemed Toyota just didn't get it.
"I was shocked when I first heard about Toyota's strategy because I could see what Tesla was doing," said Earl Stewart, a Toyota dealer in Lake Park, Fla., who also enjoys driving his Tesla Model S.
But in the last six months, sales of electric vehicles have slowed, and American car buyers looking to cut their fuel bill and tailpipe emissions have been flocking to hybrids. Now Toyota's sales are booming, and the company is reporting huge profits.
"It's not the first time Toyota has proved me wrong, and it won't be the last, either," Mr. Stewart said.
Toyota's sudden strength is a reminder of how profoundly the auto industry is changing. Developing technologies like electric vehicles, advanced microchips and software are turning what was once a steady, slow-moving sector into a dynamic industry in which even fast-moving and well-run manufacturers can be knocked off course.
Toyota, a Japanese company, is the world's largest automaker; it sold more than 11 million vehicles in 2023, more than six times as many as Tesla. The company climbed the ranks of the industry slowly over a half century, first exporting small cars to the United States, then building factories across the South and Midwest, adding a luxury brand and expanding into the segments dominated by its Michigan-based rivals, like full-size pickup trucks.
A few times along the way, Toyota has bucked the industry's conventional wisdom. The introduction of its upscale Lexus brand, in 1989, seemed like a risky bet until it zoomed ahead of BMW and Mercedes-Benz in sales. Twenty-one years ago, Toyota introduced the Prius, a small car with a compact gasoline engine and an electric motor powered by a battery.
The combination allows the Prius to go 50 or more miles on a gallon of gas, and a plug-in hybrid model can make short trips without using any gasoline. Other automakers dismissed the car as a curiosity, but the Prius was a hit, and before long G.M., Ford and others developed their own hybrids.
Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, scorns hybrids, saying it makes no sense to have two propulsion systems under the hood. Consumers don't seem to care. Toyota offers more than two dozen hybrid or plug-in hybrid models, and they make up almost 30 percent of its sales, much higher than at most other automakers. Last year in the U.S. market, Toyota sold 2.2 million vehicles -- more than every automaker except G.M.
In January and February, Toyota's U.S. sales rose 20 percent, powered by an 83 percent rise in sales of its hybrids and plug-in models.
"We're not saying E.V.s are not a good solution to carbon emissions," said Jack Hollis, executive vice president of Toyota's North American arm. "They are. They're just not the only solution, and a lot of our customers have been telling us they want choice -- hybrids, plug-ins, and E.V.s."
The strategy is paying off. In the nine-month period starting last April, Toyota made $ 27 billion in profit, roughly double its earnings from the same period a year earlier. By comparison, Tesla's $ 15 billion profit in 2023 was about 19 percent higher than its 2022 figure.
Investors have taken notice. The stock market now values Tesla at less than half its peak market capitalization of $ 1.2 trillion in November 2021 in large part because its sales are growing more slowly and the profit it makes on each car has been falling. Over the same period, Toyota's valuation has risen by roughly a third, to about $ 400 billion.
Mike Ramsey, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, said Toyota's hybrid strategy is strong and based on long-term logic, but shifts in technology or the market could undermine the company's future performance and standing.
"Toyota seems to swing between dullard and genius, depending on the current state of thinking about technology," he said. "But no matter what, they still seem to sell more cars and trucks than anyone else."
One big market where Toyota is struggling is China, the world's largest car market. A lot of Chinese car buyers are opting for electric vehicles, helping domestic automakers like BYD gain market share from Toyota, Volkswagen and other foreign manufacturers.
Toyota has other problems, too. The company's Daihatsu subsidiary, which makes small cars, temporarily stopped all production in Japan in December after revealing that it had cheated on safety tests.
For now, however, Toyota's deliberate pace seems to be working overall and several other large automakers have moved closer to the company's path.
Mercedes-Benz, which had been hoping to phase out internal combustion models by 2030, said last month that it had pushed that goal back by at least five years. Ford has lowered production targets for electric vehicles and is slowing construction on plants that are supposed to produce batteries for electric vehicles.
G.M., which had stopped selling hybrids in the United States to focus on electric vehicles, has delayed the introduction of a few battery-powered models. It is also now planning to reintroduce hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, which dealers had pushed for.
"Deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of E.V.s as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in February.
Electric vehicles have so far failed to win over many car buyers because they are generally more expensive than combustion or hybrid models even after taking into account government incentives. The challenges of charging electric vehicles, worries about range and their performance in cold weather have also caused some people to hesitate.
Hybrids don't face many of those issues. Some hybrids cost only a few hundred dollars more than similar gasoline cars -- a premium that owners can quickly recoup in fuel savings. In addition, regular hybrids never have to be plugged in.
Plug-in hybrid models, some of which can travel on just electricity for more than 40 miles and have a gasoline engine for longer trips, have much smaller batteries than electric vehicles and can be recharged relatively quickly. But these vehicles, which make up a small part of the market, may not be as beneficial financially or environmentally when driven long distances on just gasoline.
Toyota has plans to significantly increase hybrid production and sales. A hybrid version of its Tacoma pickup is rolling out. A redesigned Camry sedan, due this spring, will be available only as a hybrid.
The company will offer a range of electric vehicles, too, said Mr. Hollis, the Toyota executive. About 30 models will arrive by 2026, when Toyota hopes its U.S. electric vehicle sales will have risen to about 1.5 million vehicles a year. Last year it sold about 15,000.
In Florida, new Toyotas that arrive at Mr. Stewart's dealership in South Florida barely hit the lot before they are sold. At the beginning of March, he had only about 150 vehicles in inventory, down from the 500 he used to carry before the pandemic.
That hasn't deterred customers who have become accustomed to waiting months after ordering vehicles. At one point last year, he had 1,300 vehicles on order, and customers for all of them.
"I've been selling Toyotas since 1975, and business is better than ever," he said. "People are lining up to buy from me."

Hybrids don’t face many of those issues. Some hybrids cost only a few hundred dollars more than similar gasoline cars — a premium that owners can quickly recoup in fuel savings. In addition, regular hybrids never have to be plugged in.
Plug-in hybrid models, some of which can travel on just electricity for more than 40 miles and have a gasoline engine for longer trips, have much smaller batteries than electric vehicles and can be recharged relatively quickly. But these vehicles, which make up a small part of the market, may not be as beneficial financially or environmentally when driven long distances on just gasoline.
Toyota has plans to significantly increase hybrid production and sales. A hybrid version of its Tacoma pickup is rolling out. A redesigned Camry sedan, due this spring, will be available only as a hybrid.
The company will offer a range of electric vehicles, too, said Hollis, the Toyota executive. About 30 models will arrive by 2026, when Toyota hopes its U.S. electric vehicle sales will have risen to about 1.5 million vehicles a year. Last year it sold about 15,000.
In Florida, new Toyotas that arrive at Stewart’s dealership in South Florida barely hit the lot before they are sold. At the beginning of March, he had only about 150 vehicles in inventory, down from the 500 he used to carry before the pandemic.
That hasn’t deterred customers who have become accustomed to waiting months after ordering vehicles. At one point last year, he had 1,300 vehicles on order, and customers for all of them.
“I’ve been selling Toyotas since 1975, and business is better than ever,” he said. “People are lining up to buy from me.”

Full text: "Once again -- not guilty," Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said. His wife, Nadine Menendez, also pleaded not guilty.
For the third time in six months, Senator Robert Menendez stood before a judge in Manhattan on Monday to be formally arraigned on charges in an expansive federal bribery case. He pleaded not guilty, just as he had twice before.
"Once again -- not guilty, your honor," Mr. Menendez told the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court.
Mr. Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, has previously pleaded not guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for political favors and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government.
On Monday, he pleaded not guilty to obstruction of justice, a charge added last week in an updated indictment.
His wife, Nadine Menendez, also pleaded not guilty to obstructing justice. Two New Jersey businessmen accused of bribing the couple with gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, similarly reiterated their not-guilty pleas.
The appearance of the four defendants was brief and largely perfunctory, but the senator, 70, and Ms. Menendez, 57, were surrounded by news cameras as they exited the building in silence and climbed into a waiting car.
The new charges come less than two months before the scheduled start of the trial, May 6.
Judge Stein said that he intended to hold firm to the planned timeline, but he also suggested that a pretrial appeal that could lead to a monthslong delay was possible.
The obstruction of justice charges appear to be related to information provided by Jose Uribe, a former insurance broker accused in September in the bribery conspiracy. Earlier this month, Mr. Uribe admitted that he had tried to bribe the senator with a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible in exchange for Mr. Menendez's efforts to scuttle an insurance fraud investigation in New Jersey.
Mr. Uribe, 56, is now cooperating with prosecutors.
He told the judge that he and Ms. Menendez met at a hotel to get their stories straight after he received a subpoena in connection to the case. During that meeting, he said he agreed to lie to investigators -- and to his own lawyer.
The car, according to prosecutors, was one of the first bribes provided for the benefit of the senator and Ms. Menendez. The Mercedes replaced a vehicle that police records show Ms. Menendez was driving in December 2018 when she struck and killed a pedestrian, Richard Koop, in Bogota, N.J.
Last week's updated indictment accused the senator and his wife of lying to their lawyers, too, and trying to make it appear as though car payments arranged by Mr. Uribe were loans, not bribes.
"Menendez and Nadine Menendez wrote checks and letters falsely characterizing the return of bribe money," prosecutors wrote in the fourth successive indictment, which increased the number of criminal counts to 18, up from four.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have said that overzealous prosecutors were criminalizing normal legislative activity and flouting protections afforded to members of Congress by the Constitution's speech or debate clause. They have filed motions seeking to have the indictment dismissed, and the judge is expected to rule on that request soon.
If Judge Stein does not dismiss the indictment, defendants will be permitted to ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to weigh in on charges that might relate to the speech or debate clause, according to two lawyers involved in the case.
Short of that, however, Judge Stein indicated that he had no intention of deviating from the May 6 start date. Prosecutors have said that the case involved a voluminous amount of evidence seized in searches of the senator's home and the defendants' electronic devices -- some of which involves sensitive information classified as secret by the government.
On Monday, a prosecutor from the Southern District of New York said that he expected the government's case to take between four and six weeks; the defense case is likely to last for at least a week.
"The trial is coming up very quickly -- I think unjustly quickly," Lawrence S. Lustberg, Mr. Hana's lawyer, said outside the courthouse.
He said that Mr. Hana, an Egyptian-American who founded a halal meat company that prosecutors have said was used to funnel bribes to the senator and his wife, was innocent of the charges and prepared to prove that at trial.
Mr. Menendez is in his third full term in the U.S. Senate. He has not said whether he would compete in a Democratic primary for re-election, as he had planned to do before he was indicted; the primary, on June 4, could occur in the middle of the federal trial.
At least four other Democrats, including Representative Andy Kim and New Jersey's first lady, Tammy Murphy, are vying to run for the seat, and the filing deadline, March 25, is quickly approaching. If Mr. Menendez were to run as an independent, he would have until June 4 to file paperwork.
He has refused widespread calls for his resignation. Asked Monday if he planned to run for re-election, Mr. Menendez noted that he was standing in a courthouse.
"I don't think announcing it in a courtroom," he said, "would be the best idea."

Obstruction of Justice Added To Charges for Menendezes: [National Desk]

Full text: The New Jersey senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez, who already faced bribery charges, were charged in an 18-count superseding indictment.
Senator Robert Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were charged with obstruction of justice in a new federal indictment on Tuesday, adding to the wide-ranging bribery and corruption charges they already face.
Prosecutors accused the couple of trying to cover up a bribe by making it look like a loan.
In the process, they lied to their own lawyers, who in turn inadvertently misrepresented the arrangement to federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, according to the updated indictment.
The new indictment, returned by a grand jury in Manhattan, expands the charges from four to 18, and comes just two months before Mr. Menendez, Ms. Menendez and two New Jersey businessmen are scheduled for trial.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday in a letter to the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, that the new indictment should not affect the scheduled trial date of May 6.
The senator and his wife and the two businessmen -- Wael Hana and Fred Daibes -- all pleaded not guilty to the earlier charges and are expected to appear for an arraignment on the new counts soon.
The indictment comes just days after a fifth defendant, Jose Uribe, a former New Jersey insurance broker, pleaded guilty to trying to bribe the couple with a Mercedes-Benz and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation.
Some of the new charges against Mr. Menendez and his wife appear related to information that was provided to the government by Mr. Uribe, who in court on Friday described getting a message from Ms. Menendez after he first received a subpoena in the case.
He told Judge Stein that they met a few hours later at a Marriott hotel, and they discussed the Mercedes that Mr. Uribe had given Ms. Menendez in exchange for the senator's efforts to disrupt an insurance fraud investigation in New Jersey.
"She asked what was I going to say if somebody asked me about the car payments," Mr. Uribe said in court, according to a transcript of the proceeding.
He then agreed to lie to investigators -- and to his own lawyer, he told the judge.
"I knew that giving a car in return for influencing a United States senator to stop a criminal investigation was wrong," Mr. Uribe added, "and I deeply regret my actions."
Prosecutors said that Mr. Menendez and his wife hatched a plan to pay Mr. Uribe back after becoming aware that they were under investigation. They falsely referred to payments made for the Mercedes as a "loan" in conversations with their lawyers, deliberately mischaracterizing the transaction.
As a result, the indictment charges, Mr. Menendez last June "caused his then counsel to make false and misleading statements to the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York." Two months later, Ms. Menendez did the same, the indictment says.
Mr. Menendez, in a statement issued through his lawyers, called the new indictment "a flagrant abuse of power."
"The government has long known that I learned of and helped repay loans -- not bribes -- that had been provided to my wife," the senator said. "Not content -- or capable -- of meeting those facts fairly at trial, the government has now falsely alleged a cover-up and obstruction."
Mr. Menendez said the latest charges revealed far more about the government than about him, and that prosecutors were "unconstrained by any sense of justice or fair play." He added: "It says, once and for all, that they will stop at nothing in their zeal to get me."
Lawrence S. Lustberg, a lawyer for Mr. Hana, said he was still analyzing the new indictment. "It is, however, stunning to receive such a dramatic alteration of a charging document only two months before trial following an investigation that has lasted for years," he said.
David Schertler, a lawyer for Ms. Menendez, and César de Castro, a lawyer for Mr. Daibes, each had no comment.
Mr. Menendez, 70, a New Jersey Democrat, was charged in September with accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars and a luxury Mercedes, in exchange for lucrative political favors and what prosecutors described as efforts to derail criminal investigations.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have since expanded the accusations by filing revised indictments.
In October, Mr. Menendez was additionally charged with conspiring to act as an agent of Egypt while also serving as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And in January, prosecutors said he had used his power to aid the government of Qatar, a tiny Gulf state and major natural gas exporter that hosted the World Cup in 2022.
The new indictment comes as Judge Stein is considering defense motions to dismiss charges in the case. On Monday, he denied other motions seeking to exclude evidence that the defense argued was the product of unconstitutional searches by investigators.

Ex-Financial Gatekeeper For Trump Pleads Guilty: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Allen H. Weisselberg, the former Trump Organization finance chief, has already spent time at the Rikers Island jail complex. The perjury plea will send him back.
Allen H. Weisselberg, former President Donald J. Trump's longtime financial gatekeeper, pleaded guilty to felony perjury charges in a Manhattan courtroom on Monday, the latest twist in a tortured legal odyssey.
Yet Mr. Weisselberg, who for years has remained steadfastly loyal to Mr. Trump in the face of intense prosecutorial pressure, did not implicate his former boss. That unbroken streak of loyalty has frustrated prosecutors and now, at the age of 76, will cost Mr. Weisselberg his freedom a second time.
The plea agreement with the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, comes weeks before the former president will stand trial on unrelated criminal charges. That case, also brought by Mr. Bragg, stems from a hush-money payment made on Mr. Trump's behalf to a porn star during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mr. Weisselberg, who was led into the courtroom in handcuffs wearing a blue surgical mask and a dark suit, conceded that in recent years he had lied under oath to the New York attorney general's office when it was investigating Mr. Trump for fraud. The attorney general, Letitia James, sued Mr. Trump in 2022, accusing him of wildly inflating his net worth to obtain favorable loans and other benefits.
That civil case recently ended with a judge imposing a huge financial penalty on the former president -- more than $ 450 million with interest. Mr. Weisselberg, who was also a defendant in the case, was penalized $ 1 million plus interest and permanently banned from serving in a financial position at any New York company.
Although Mr. Weisselberg neither committed violence nor orchestrated an elaborate scheme, Mr. Bragg's prosecutors argued that perjury undermines the broader ends of justice and cannot be ignored.
Gary Fishman, one of the prosecutors, on Monday underscored the harm caused by perjury, which he said "tears at the very fabric of our justice system."
Prosecutors sought a five-month sentence for Mr. Weisselberg, acknowledging his age in coming to their recommendation; his sentencing before the judge in the case, Laurie Peterson, is scheduled for April 10.
Mr. Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury related to his testimony in a July 2020 deposition with Ms. James's office, stood placidly on Monday as he answered the judge's questions about his plea, often with one-word responses.
He also admitted to lying at the civil fraud trial, but did not plead guilty to that, a move that will spare him a steeper sentence.
"Allen Weisselberg looks forward to putting this situation behind him," one of Mr. Weisselberg's lawyers, Seth L. Rosenberg, said in a statement released by his firm, Clayman Rosenberg Kirshner & Linder.
Mr. Weisselberg has often been caught in the middle of Mr. Trump's legal travails, facing pressure from several law enforcement agencies in both civil and criminal cases. As the long-serving chief financial officer for Mr. Trump's family business -- his trusted moneyman -- Mr. Weisselberg was considered a linchpin in efforts to implicate him.
Mr. Weisselberg has been rewarded for his loyalty to the family he served for nearly a half century: When he left the company, the Trump Organization, last year, he was awarded a $ 2 million severance package that required him not to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation unless legally required.
He also paid a price. In 2022, Mr. Weisselberg pleaded guilty in a tax fraud case in which he admitted to awarding himself off-the-books perks, including a luxury apartment and a Mercedes-Benz. Although he did not implicate Mr. Trump, he agreed to testify against the Trump Organization at its trial on the same charges.
The company was convicted, and Mr. Weisselberg received a five-month sentence. With good behavior, he served nearly 100 days behind bars at the notorious Rikers Island jail complex.
Mr. Weisselberg now faces another stint at Rikers, a steep fall for a man who spent years embedded in the Trump family business as its financial whiz and bulldog negotiator.
He lived in a Trump building. He helped assemble tax returns for Mr. Trump. And he helped run Mr. Trump's company after he was elected president.
Mr. Weisselberg did not respond to questions from reporters on Monday as he left the courthouse at 100 Centre Street after entering his plea. He piled into the back seat of a black Cadillac Escalade parked outside, surrounded by a phalanx of news photographers and television camera crews.
Mr. Weisselberg's deal comes at an inopportune time for Mr. Trump, just weeks before he is expected to go to trial on a raft of felony charges accusing him of falsifying business records related to the hush-money deal with the porn star, Stormy Daniels.
The trial, the first criminal prosecution of a former president, is scheduled to begin with jury selection on March 25.
Mr. Bragg has accused Mr. Trump of orchestrating a cover-up of a potential sex scandal involving Ms. Daniels that could have influenced the 2016 election.
Monday's guilty plea could strengthen Mr. Bragg's hand heading into the trial, deterring other witnesses in Mr. Trump's circle from lying on the stand. The perjury charges could also discredit Mr. Weisselberg, who was involved in the hush-money deal and has disputed details of the prosecution's evidence in the case.
For his part, Mr. Trump has lashed out at Mr. Bragg, a Democrat, accusing him of persecuting Mr. Weisselberg. Mr. Trump's allies have lamented that Mr. Weisselberg will have to again serve time behind bars well into his 70s. They have also disputed that he lied in the civil fraud case brought by Ms. James, another Democrat.
"This plea was no doubt extorted by threatening an elderly and innocent man with immediate and lengthy incarceration," Christopher M. Kise, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, said in a statement. "Such alarming, shameful and oppressive tactics have no place in our justice system and expose the citizens of New York to irreparable and life-altering harm."
Ms. James filed her lawsuit in 2022, and it led to a trial late last year. In February, the judge presiding over the nonjury case sided with the attorney general, concluding that Mr. Trump had manipulated the value of his properties. The judge, Arthur F. Engoron, imposed a sweeping array of punishments, including the more than $ 450 million judgment.
A focus of the case -- and Mr. Weisselberg's testimony -- was Mr. Trump's triplex apartment in Trump Tower, which is 10,996 square feet, but had been listed for years on his annual financial statements as measuring 30,000 square feet.
Before Ms. James filed the lawsuit, in a 2020 deposition under oath, Mr. Weisselberg played down his involvement in valuing the triplex. He did the same in a second deposition last year, after the suit was filed. And on the witness stand at the trial, Mr. Weisselberg claimed that he "never focused" on the unit.
Yet soon after, Forbes magazine, which compiles a list of America's richest people, published an article citing emails and notes showing that Mr. Weisselberg "played a key role in trying to convince Forbes over the course of several years" of the apartment's value.
In pleading guilty to two counts on Monday related to the 2020 deposition, Mr. Weisselberg admitted to lying about when he learned the actual size of the triplex and whether he had ever been present when Mr. Trump had inflated its square footage.
He also admitted to lying in his second deposition and at trial, but was not required to plead guilty to doing so.
Because he is pleading guilty only to the lies that occurred in 2020 -- before his guilty plea in the tax fraud case -- Mr. Weisselberg avoided violating his probation and being labeled a two-time felon, which would have led to a significantly longer sentence.
"There is something in it for everyone," said Marc A. Agnifilo, a veteran defense lawyer. "The D.A.'s office gets some jail time and the defendant avoids substantial state prison time."
Justice Engoron concluded that Mr. Weisselberg was not a credible witness at trial, in part because of his severance agreement, which is paid in installments over time, as if to keep Mr. Weisselberg in thrall to the Trump family.
"His testimony in this trial was intentionally evasive, with large gaps of 'I don't remember,"' the judge wrote in his decision last month, adding that the severance agreement "renders his testimony highly unreliable."
"The Trump Organization keeps Weisselberg on a short leash," the justice wrote. "And it shows."

Although he did not implicate Trump, he agreed to testify against the Trump Organization at its trial on the same charges.
The company was convicted, and Weisselberg received a five-month sentence. With good behavior, he served nearly 100 days behind bars at the notorious Rikers Island jail complex.
Weisselberg now faces another stint at Rikers, a steep fall for a man who spent years embedded in the Trump family business as its financial whiz and bulldog negotiator.
He lived in a Trump building. He helped assemble tax returns for Trump. And he helped run Trump’s company after he was elected president.
Weisselberg did not respond to questions from reporters Monday as he left the courthouse after entering his plea. He piled into the back seat of a black Cadillac Escalade parked outside, surrounded by a phalanx of news photographers and television camera crews.
Weisselberg’s deal comes at an inopportune time for Trump, just weeks before he is expected to go to trial on a raft of felony charges accusing him of falsifying business records related to the hush-money deal with porn actor Stormy Daniels. The trial, the first criminal prosecution of a former president, is scheduled to begin with jury selection March 25.
Bragg has accused Trump of orchestrating a cover-up of a potential sex scandal involving Daniels that could have influenced the 2016 election.
Monday’s guilty plea could strengthen Bragg’s hand heading into the trial, deterring other witnesses in Trump’s circle from lying on the stand. The perjury charges could also discredit Weisselberg, who was involved in the hush-money deal and has disputed details of the prosecution’s evidence in the case.
For his part, Trump has lashed out at Bragg, a Democrat, accusing him of persecuting Weisselberg. Trump’s allies have lamented that Weisselberg will have to again serve time behind bars well into his 70s. They have also disputed that he lied in the civil fraud case brought by James, another Democrat.
“This plea was no doubt extorted by threatening an elderly and innocent man with immediate and lengthy incarceration,” Christopher Kise, one of Trump’s lawyers, said in a statement. “Such alarming, shameful and oppressive tactics have no place in our justice system and expose the citizens of New York to irreparable and life-altering harm.”
James filed her lawsuit in 2022, and it led to a trial late last year. In February, the judge presiding over the nonjury case sided with the attorney general, concluding that Trump had manipulated the value of his properties. Judge Arthur Engoron imposed a sweeping array of punishments, including the more than $450 million judgment.
A focus of the case — and Weisselberg’s testimony — was Trump’s triplex apartment in Trump Tower, which is 10,996 square feet but had been listed for years on his annual financial statements as measuring 30,000 square feet.
Before James filed the lawsuit, in a 2020 deposition under oath Weisselberg played down his involvement in valuing the triplex. He did the same in a second deposition last year, after the suit was filed. And on the witness stand at the trial, Weisselberg claimed that he “never focused” on the unit.
Yet soon after, Forbes magazine, which compiles a list of America’s richest people, published an article citing emails and notes showing that Weisselberg “played a key role in trying to convince Forbes over the course of several years” of the apartment’s value.
In pleading guilty to two counts Monday related to the 2020 deposition, Weisselberg admitted to lying about when he learned the actual size of the triplex and whether he had ever been present when Trump had inflated its square footage.
He also admitted to lying in his second deposition and at trial, but was not required to plead guilty to doing so.
Because he is pleading guilty only to the lies that occurred in 2020 — before his guilty plea in the tax fraud case — Weisselberg avoided violating his probation and being labeled a two-time felon, which would have led to a significantly longer sentence.
“There is something in it for everyone,” said Marc Agnifilo, a veteran defense lawyer. “The DA’s office gets some jail time, and the defendant avoids substantial state prison time.”
Engoron concluded that Weisselberg was not a credible witness at trial, in part because of his severance agreement, which is paid in installments over time, as if to keep Weisselberg in thrall to the Trump family.
“His testimony in this trial was intentionally evasive, with large gaps of ‘I don’t remember,’” the judge wrote in his decision last month, adding that the severance agreement “renders his testimony highly unreliable.”
“The Trump Organization keeps Weisselberg on a short leash,” the judge wrote. “And it shows.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jose Uribe admitted providing a Mercedes-Benz for Senator Robert Menendez to "influence an official act." Mr. Menendez has pleaded not guilty, as have his wife and two other co-defendants.
After Jose Uribe, a New Jersey businessman, was subpoenaed in connection with a broad bribery investigation involving Senator Robert Menendez, he got a message from the senator's wife, Nadine Menendez.
She wanted to get their stories straight about a Mercedes-Benz convertible he had given her as a bribe, he admitted Friday in federal court in Manhattan. They met a few hours later at a Marriott Hotel.
"She asked what was I going to say if somebody asked me about the car payments," he said.
He agreed to lie to investigators -- and to his own lawyer, he said.
"Nadine says something like, 'That sounds good,"' he told the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, according to a transcript of the proceeding.
Mr. Uribe, 56, then pleaded guilty to seven counts, including conspiracy to commit bribery, honest services wire fraud, obstruction of justice and tax evasion.
He also agreed to cooperate fully with prosecutors in their investigation, according to a formal plea agreement signed by Mr. Uribe, his lawyer and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.
Mr. Uribe was one of three businessmen charged in what prosecutors say was a vast, yearslong bribery scheme involving Mr. Menendez and his wife. The couple is accused of accepting the car, bars of gold bullion and hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for the senator's willingness to provide political favors and to help the governments of Egypt and Qatar.
Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, his wife and the two other businessmen have pleaded not guilty and are facing trial in May.
Ms. Menendez's lawyers had no comment about Mr. Uribe's admissions.
Mr. Menendez's lawyer, Adam Fee, said Mr. Uribe's decision to plead guilty "does not change the core truth: Senator Menendez is innocent and the prosecutors have got it wrong."
"Senator Menendez has spent months detailing the law and the evidence that demonstrate that charges should never have been filed in this case," Mr. Fee said, adding that Mr. Menendez looked forward to "proving his innocence to a jury."
Mr. Uribe, a former New Jersey insurance broker, was charged in three successive indictments with providing Ms. Menendez with the Mercedes in exchange for Mr. Menendez's efforts to intercede in an insurance fraud investigation in New Jersey.
In court on Friday, Mr. Uribe admitted that he gave Ms. Menendez the luxury car "in return for Senator Menendez using his power and influence as a United States senator to get a favorable outcome and to stop all investigations related to one of my associates."
"I knew that giving a car in return for influencing a United States senator to stop a criminal investigation was wrong," he said, "and I deeply regret my actions."
Three years after giving Ms. Menendez the car, as the criminal investigation was underway, he said he got "a check from Nadine paying me back for the car payments."
The car, according to prosecutors, was one of the first bribes provided for the benefit of the senator and Ms. Menendez. The Mercedes replaced a vehicle that police records show Ms. Menendez was driving in December 2018 when she struck and killed a pedestrian, Richard Koop, in Bogota, N.J. Ms. Menendez, who married Mr. Menendez in 2020, was dating the senator at the time of the crash.
She was not tested for drugs or alcohol and was not charged with wrongdoing. The New Jersey attorney general's office has said it was reviewing the initial investigation, but has refused to respond to questions about the status of the inquiry into her crash.
Months after the crash, after obtaining the new car from Mr. Uribe, she sent a text message to Mr. Menendez.
"Congratulations mon amour de la vie," she wrote, according to the indictment. "We are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes."
The car, Mr. Uribe admitted, was given in exchange for Mr. Menendez's efforts to disrupt a New Jersey insurance fraud case involving two of his associates, including a person he said he considered a member of his family.
"The deal is to kill and stop all investigation," Mr. Uribe wrote in a message to another defendant, according to the indictment.
In exchange for the $ 60,0000 car, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez attempted to use "advice and pressure" to influence a top official in the New Jersey attorney general's office -- during a phone call and an in-person meeting.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers have disputed the allegations and said that information prosecutors have gathered during the investigation that was favorable to the senator has been ignored. They have also argued that because the senator had no authority over the state prosecutor, any attempts to pressure the official could not -- even if they happened -- be considered official acts, the threshold needed to prove public corruption.
Judge Stein set Mr. Uribe's sentencing for June 14, which means it could come during the trial of Mr. Menendez and his three remaining co-defendants, which is scheduled to start on May 6. Mr. Uribe's cooperation could result in a reduced sentence, according to the agreement.
Mr. Uribe's lawyer, Daniel J. Fetterman, declined to comment, as did Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
Lawyers for Mr. Menendez have argued that warrants permitting searches of the couple's home and electronic devices were overbroad and granted by magistrate judges who were misled by prosecutors.
They have asked Judge Stein to rule that items and information found during the searches are inadmissible. Mr. Menendez's lawyers have also asked the judge to dismiss the indictment altogether, saying that overzealous prosecutors were criminalizing normal legislative activity and flouting constitutional protections afforded to members of Congress.
Judge Stein is expected to issue his decision in the coming weeks.
This is not the first time that Mr. Uribe has pleaded guilty.
After being charged with insurance fraud in New Jersey, he admitted in 2011 to taking nearly $ 77,000 in premiums from clients and creating the false impression that he had used the funds to buy insurance for their commercial vehicles. He lost his license to sell insurance and was sentenced to probation.
It is unclear whether the case Mr. Uribe hoped Mr. Menendez would scuttle on behalf of his associates was linked to the earlier state prosecution.
Federal prosecutors noted in the indictment against Mr. Menendez that Mr. Uribe got a call from the senator's office in Washington after he sought help in 2019.
"I am a very happy person," Mr. Uribe wrote in a text message to Ms. Menendez. "GOD bless you and him for ever."
Several nights later, according to the indictment, Mr. Uribe met the senator and Ms. Menendez for "a celebratory dinner and toasted with a bottle of champagne."
Prosecutors included a photo of the toast in the charging document.
Soon after, Mr. Uribe arranged for an unnamed trucking company to begin making automatic payments for the Mercedes, prosecutors said.

South Plants Next Target For U.A.W.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A looming union election at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga could determine the trajectory of union organizing at more than a dozen auto factories.
When Shawn Fain, the United Automobile Workers president, unveiled the deal that ended six weeks of strikes at Ford Motor in the fall, he framed it as part of a longer campaign. Next, he declared, would be the task of organizing nonunion plants across the country.
"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we've never organized before," he said at the time. "When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won't just be with the Big Three. It will be the Big Five or Big Six."
Four months later, the first test of that strategy has come into focus, and it features a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.
According to the union, more than half of over 4,000 eligible workers have signed cards indicating support for a union. Workers say they have done so because they want higher pay, more paid time off and more generous health benefits -- and because the recent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis persuaded them that a union can help win these concessions.
"The Big Three, they had their big campaign, and their big strike and vote, and new contracts -- we paid attention to that very closely," said Yolanda Peoples, who has worked at the Volkswagen plant for nearly 13 years.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11 percent pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three. The raise brought the top hourly wage for production workers to $ 32.40, but the comparable wage for the Detroit automakers will exceed $ 40 by the end of the new contracts. (Volkswagen said the wage adjustment was part of a yearly review.)
Unions need a simple majority of votes to win, but the U.A.W. says it won't file for an election at the Chattanooga plant until 70 percent of the plant's workers have signed cards and workers have built an extensive organizing committee, which union officials expect in the next month.
The caution reflects the U.A.W.'s experience in the South, where past campaigns fell short.
But the stakes may be even higher this time given the union's investment in organizing several plants at once -- including a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama, where more than 50 percent of workers have signed cards, and a Hyundai plant in Alabama, where the union has cards from more than 30 percent of workers.
Last week, the union said it was also allocating $ 40 million to organizing auto and battery workers through 2026 -- far exceeding its previous budget for such efforts, according to Jonah Furman, a union spokesman -- and suggested that time was of the essence.
"In the next few years, the electric vehicle battery industry is slated to add tens of thousands of jobs across the country, and new standards are being set as the industry comes online," the union said in its funding announcement.
If the union wins in Chattanooga, said Joshua Murray, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University who has studied the auto industry's response to unionization, it may quickly replicate the victory at other plants, as it did during an organizing wave in the 1930s.
"A lot of time the failure to unionize is not that workers are against being in a union -- it's that they're not convinced they can win," Dr. Murray said. "Showing they can win is a big deal for getting workers who weren't gung-ho about it to be gung-ho."
A loss in Chattanooga, Dr. Murray said, could sap employees' confidence and encourage management at other automakers to resist.
Other analysts, like Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that Tesla would be a particular challenge. "The head of Tesla is Elon Musk, and he's going to fight against change," Mr. Fiorani said.
The union appears to be benefiting from a resurgence of interest in organizing after a lull during the presidency of Donald J. Trump and the start of the pandemic. Last year, unions won more than 1,225 elections -- the most in at least a decade, according to the National Labor Relations Board. They lost about 500.
Polling shows that younger workers are especially supportive, and they appear to be helping to fuel the recent auto industry organizing. "We're letting them know, 'You're making a nice pay rate compared to your age, but this can be better,"' said Ronald Terry, a worker involved in the organizing at the Hyundai plant in Alabama.
Younger workers at the Volkswagen plant also express frustration at the paid time off they accrue: 12 or 13 days during their first two years of employment, several of which they must use during plant shutdowns if they want to be paid.
Asked about the complaints, a Volkswagen spokesman said that the company understood that time off was a significant issue and that it had recently announced an increase in unpaid time off for emergencies.
The company said last month that its Chattanooga wages had increased at nearly twice the rate of inflation since 2013, and that the average production worker would make more than $ 60,000 this year before bonuses or overtime and pay less than $ 2,000 in premiums to cover more than 80 percent of health care costs.
The union sought a vote in Chattanooga in 2014 and faced no opposition from the company, whose worldwide plants are mostly unionized. But the effort failed amid pressure from state Republican leaders, who suggested that a union would jeopardize the plant's expansion.
With workers complaining of understaffing, high injury rates and last-minute overtime, the U.A.W. tried again in 2019. But pleas from Tennessee's governor and the plant's original chief executive, who said he had returned to his former position to address workers' concerns, appeared to defuse support. The union narrowly lost.
This time, the union appears determined to minimize the effect of such pushback.
The union wants to recruit a volunteer leader for every line on every shift at the plant -- more than 125 altogether, according to the union's tally. That way, organizers say, the volunteers can quickly respond to rumors or company talking points that co-workers encounter.
"If you don't have someone continuing that conversation, we have seen some of that backsliding in a few smaller areas," said Isaac Meadows, a worker involved in the organizing.
He attributed the backsliding to the influence of outside groups and chatter from workers' friends and relatives that a union would discourage employers from locating in Tennessee.
Gerald McCormick, a Republican who as the state's House majority leader opposed the union during the 2014 vote, said Republicans might worry that the union would support left-wing causes in Tennessee if it got a foothold there.
"They don't want to do them any favors," he said, referring to the state's Republican leadership, which he predicted would oppose the union campaign again.
As in 2019, the employer's response may be crucial. The Volkswagen brand appears to be roughly holding its own in the United States, and somewhat ahead in the transition to electric vehicles.
More than 11 percent of Volkswagen's U.S. sales last year came from E.V.s -- specifically the ID.4, a compact sport utility vehicle built in Chattanooga. That figure was higher than the overall 9.4 percent share for plug-in vehicles in the U.S. market, according to BloombergNEF, an energy research firm.
A Volkswagen official said during a tour of the plant that about one-third of its output this year would probably be ID.4s, and that the share could double within a decade.
If that happens, the plant may be relatively well positioned to absorb higher labor costs. Corey Cantor, an electric vehicle analyst at BloombergNEF, said continued battery innovation, along with efficiencies from larger-scale battery production, could offset the cost increases associated with unionization.
But a union presence could complicate the ramp-up in electric vehicle production, Mr. Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions said, if the union resists the decline in workers per car that may accompany the shift. He noted that companies that made their own batteries might be able to reallocate those workers rather than lay them off, however.
Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said in a statement that the plant had already added jobs in battery pack assembly and battery engineering.
Meeting with reporters last month, a Volkswagen official said that the company would stay neutral during an election campaign, but that "neutral doesn't mean silent -- it means impartial to what employees decide."
The official added that the company would correct misinformation, which it accuses the union of spreading, about pay and working conditions in the plant. (Companies reaching neutrality agreements with unions typically do not intervene this way.)
Mr. Meadows, the union supporter, said managers had communicated skepticism in sometimes subtle ways, like removing union fliers from lunch tables.
"Somebody put out a couple of business cards for a lawn service company, and we had some material on the same table," Mr. Meadows recalled. "Our materials disappeared, and the others did not."
Volkswagen said the cleanliness of the tables was governed by "clear policies."

Wrong Turns Doom Efforts On Apple Car: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Internal disagreements over the direction of the Apple car led the effort to sputter for years before it was canceled this week.
For the last decade, many Apple employees working on the company's secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.
Throughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped and rebooted several times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google's Waymo.
By the time of its death -- Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence -- Apple had burned more than $ 10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla's, according to a half dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.
The car project's demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs's death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.
Apple declined to comment.
"When it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on," said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. "A decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain."
When Apple launched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Google began testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn't want to be left behind.
At the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project's origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.
Apple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $ 2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $ 200 billion business.
Despite having a vote of confidence from Apple's chief executive, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $ 100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.
The company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
From its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said. Steve Zadesky, who initially led the effort, wanted to build an electric vehicle that competed with Tesla. Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, wanted to pursue a self-driving car, which members of the software team said could be done.
Apple, which by then had $ 155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of A.I. technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company's culture.
The car team, composed of more than 2,000 employees by this year, included engineers who had worked for NASA and developed racecars for Porsche.
The group developed an array of new technologies, including a windshield that could display turn-by-turn directions and a sunroof that would feature special polymer to reduce heat from the sun.
To bolster morale and guidance, star executives like Mr. Ive and the head of Mac engineering, Bob Mansfield, got involved. The company acquired several start-ups to join the car team. In 2021, to steer the project toward success, Apple put Kevin Lynch, the executive behind its popular Apple Watch, in charge of the car.
Mr. Ive and his team of designers drew concepts for a car that would look like a European minivan such as the Fiat Multipla 600, which has a half-dozen windows and a curving roof. It had no steering wheel and would be controlled using Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.
One day, in the fall of 2015, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cook met at the project's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., for a demonstration of how the car might work. The two men sank into the seats of a cabinlike interior. Outside, a voice actor read from a script of what Siri would say as the men zoomed down the road in the imaginary car. Mr. Ive asked Siri what restaurant they passed and the actor read an answer, said two people familiar with the demonstration.
But by 2016, it was clear that the car effort was in trouble. Mr. Zadesky left Apple, and his successor, Mr. Mansfield, told the team working on the project that they would be shifting their focus from building a car to building self-driving car software, said three people familiar with the shift.
Apple secured permits from California to begin test-driving Lexus sport utility vehicles outfitted with sensors and computers. It held discussions with car makers such as BMW, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz before striking a deal with Volkswagen to provide Transporter vans for self-driving shuttles on Apple's campus.
Two more leaders took over the car effort in the years that followed. Doug Field, a former Tesla executive, laid off more than 200 employees on the project as he leaned into efforts to build its self-driving system. Then Mr. Lynch, who succeeded him in recent years, reversed the company's plans and went back to its original idea of making an electric vehicle.
Mr. Mansfield and Mr. Field didn't respond to requests for comment.
At the start of this year, Apple's leadership decided that it was a better use of the company's time to work on generative A.I. rather than the car, the company told employees in an internal meeting on Tuesday. The company said some members of the Project Titan team would be reassigned to work on artificial intelligence.
In interviews on Wednesday with The New York Times, people who worked on the project praised the decision to shutter it, saying the technology behind generative A.I. could be invaluable to the future of the company's all-important iPhone business.
Apple's dead car project will be survived by its underlying technologies. The company plans to take what it has learned about artificial intelligence and automation and apply it to other technologies that are being researched, including A.I.-powered AirPods with cameras, robot assistants and augmented reality, according to three people briefed on the projects.
Though the engineers working on automation software will get to work on artificial intelligence projects, others on the car team have been told they will need to apply for different roles at the company.

SAN FRANCISCO — For the past decade, many Apple employees working on the company’s secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.
Throughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped and rebooted several times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google’s Waymo.
By the time of its death — Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence — Apple had burned more than $10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla’s, according to a half-dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.
The car project’s demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs’ death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.
Apple declined to comment.
“When it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on,” said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. “A decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain.”
When Apple launched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Google began testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn’t want to be left behind.
At the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project’s origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.
Apple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $200 billion business.
Despite having a vote of confidence from Apple’s CEO, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.
The company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
From its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said. Steve Zadesky, who initially led the effort, wanted to build an electric vehicle that competed with Tesla. Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, wanted to pursue a self-driving car, which members of the software team said could be done.
Apple, which by then had $155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of AI technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company’s culture.
The car team, composed of more than 2,000 employees by this year, included engineers who had worked for NASA and developed race cars for Porsche.
The group developed an array of new technologies, including a windshield that could display turn-by-turn directions and a sunroof that would feature a special polymer to reduce heat from the sun.
To bolster morale and guidance, star executives like Ive and head of Mac engineering, Bob Mansfield, got involved. The company acquired several startups to join the car team. In 2021, to steer the project toward success, Apple put Kevin Lynch, the executive behind its popular Apple Watch, in charge of the car.
Ive and his team of designers drew concepts for a car that would look like a European minivan such as the Fiat Multipla 600, which has a half-dozen windows and a curving roof. It had no steering wheel and would be controlled using Apple’s virtual assistant, Siri.
One day, in the fall of 2015, Ive and Cook met at the project’s headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, for a demonstration of how the car might work.

Mercedes-Benz Delays
Its Electric Vehicle Goals
Mercedes-Benz on Thursday delayed its electrification goal by five years and assured investors it would keep sprucing up its combustion engine models, becoming the latest carmaker to flag a weaker-than-expected appetite for battery-powered cars.
The company now expects sales of electrified vehicles, including hybrids, to account for up to 50 percent of the total by 2030, five years later than its forecast from 2021.
While automakers are betting big on future demand for electric vehicles, investment and technology development has outrun actual E.V. demand, prompting carmakers to readjust production plans.
Ola Kaellenius, the chief executive, has said that even in Europe, sales would likely not be all-electric by 2030, with battery-powered cars currently making up just 11 percent of total sales, and 19 percent including hybrids. REUTERS
EARNINGS
Moderna's Earnings
Beat Fears of a Loss
Moderna on Thursday reported a surprise fourth-quarter profit, helped by cost cutting and deferred payments, and set out a commercial road map for its vaccines in Europe and experimental respiratory syncytial virus shot.
Moderna posted a profit of $ 217 million, or 55 cents a share, for the quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 97 cents a share, according to LSEG data.
James Mock, the chief financial officer, said the company beat its own forecast because of unexpected deferred revenue of $ 600 million from the international vaccine group Gavi.
The Cambridge, Mass., drugmaker reported fourth quarter sales of $ 2.8 billion from its Covid vaccine, down 43 percent from 2022 but in line with expectations.
The company has been banking on its experimental shots including for RSV, influenza and cancer to make up for declining Covid revenue. REUTERS
FOOD
U.N. Agency Targets
Aquaculture for Hunger
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization on Thursday set a target to further increase aquaculture production to meet a rising demand for seafood and to fight global hunger and undernourishment.
The agency hopes to see 35 percent growth in the sector by 2030, according to a report adopted at the end of a three-day Asia and Pacific regional conference in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo.
Officials said the world's aquaculture production has increased by 54 percent since 2011 and remains one of the fastest growing agricultural-producing sectors. The agency's "Blue Transformation" road map seeks to transform the world's aquatic food systems by the start of the next decade.
It is projected that nearly 600 million people will be chronically undernourished by 2030. But in Asia and the Pacific, the number is projected to fall from 371 million to 202 million by 2030.

Michigan Voters' Anger Is a Problem for Biden: [Editorial]

Full text: Betrayal is a powerful emotion, especially at the ballot box. Voters who feel betrayed tend to act like spurned lovers, punishing the offending party even if it means electing somebody who will actually be worse.
That's how America got Donald Trump as president. Many blue-collar workers in factory towns in battleground states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- who were once pillars of the Democratic Party -- voted for a man who promised to rip up free trade agreements, which they blamed for the loss of manufacturing jobs. It didn't seem to matter to them that Mr. Trump had no track record of standing up for workers or that employees at his hotels faced union-busting tactics when they tried to organize.
More important was using their votes to punish Democrats for abandoning the working class.
Joe Biden understood that, and in 2020 he set out to atone for the sins of the Democratic Party by promising to be the most pro-union president ever -- a promise he has kept. It's not just that he became the first sitting president to join a picket line. It's not just that he appointed the most pro-union National Labor Relations Board since the 1930s, as the labor historian Jeff Schuhrke told me. It's all the things his appointees are doing behind the scenes.
Mr. Biden's National Labor Relations Board, for example, handed down the Cemex decision, which makes it easier for workers to win collective bargaining rights against employers. Thanks to that ruling, companies must act in a timely manner to either recognize a union or allow workers to vote on whether to form one. Companies that delay -- a common tactic used to crush organizing -- will be ordered to recognize the union and start bargaining with it as if it had won a vote. That requirement will be invaluable to the United Auto Workers as it pursues an audacious plan to unionize 150,000 autoworkers at Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and other factories around the country.
The Biden administration even fights for the rights of workers abroad when they are violated by American companies. Just this month, the Labor Department successfully pushed Goodyear Tire & Rubber to pay $ 4.2 million in back pay to more than 1,300 workers in Mexico. Instead of asking American workers to accept less to compete in the global economy, the Biden administration is trying to make sure workers abroad get more. That's not easy, but it's an inspiring use of American power.
Union leaders are obviously paying attention.
Will it make a difference to the rank and file? I asked that question in Michigan, a must-win state where unions hold tremendous sway, and got conflicting answers.
Antoine McKay, an actor who is appearing in an August Wilson play at the Detroit Repertory Theater, told me that it "absolutely matters" to him that Mr. Biden supports unions and joined workers on the picket line. Mr. McKay is a member of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which conducted a successful strike last year. "I think workers in our society are encouraged on every level because of the strikes that have happened and the outcomes of those strikes," he said.
But other interviews suggested that Mr. Biden is not going to be rewarded.
Brooke Davis, who works at the MGM Grand Detroit casino and participated in her first strike this year -- she's a U.A.W. member -- told me she's not sure whom she would vote for in the fall. People had to stand in the cold during the strike, she said, sometimes with their children, and live on $ 500 a week of strike pay, a small fraction of what they usually made. She said she appreciated the benefits they won but didn't relish doing it all over again in 2028, in a general strike that the U.A.W. is planning.
She said that the G.O.P. seemed more practical and more forward-looking. "You might not always like what they're saying," she said of the Republicans, "but you know where they stand." Democrats "are always trying to sell us hopes, sell us dreams" about solving health care and student debt, she said. It sounded good, she said, but they seemed to promise more than they could deliver. Ms. Davis is a Black woman and a union member -- two constituencies that Democrats leaned on heavily to win the state in 2020. It's not a good sign that she's undecided.
The most devastating assessment came from Merwan Beydoun, a former crane operator at a steel mill in Dearborn who once served as vice president of bargaining for his local unit. As a former U.A.W. representative, he said, he knew how important Mr. Biden's policies were to unions. "I loved it," he told me, when the president showed up at the picket line in September.
The following month, Hamas brutally attacked Israel, and Israel began its assault on Gaza. Mr. Beydoun, who is of Lebanese descent, is furious at Mr. Biden for his unwavering support of Israel's government as it flattens neighborhoods, killing thousands of children, in what he called "genocide" and collective punishment. He and his Arab American community voted for Mr. Biden in 2020. Now, he said, they felt deeply betrayed.
Mr. Beydoun used to encourage his conservative co-workers to cast their ballots for Democrats, arguing that however they felt about abortion, gun rights or gay marriage, their first allegiance should be to the union. But he has stopped telling people that. In fact, he's planning to not vote for either candidate in November. He even canceled his contribution to the U.A.W.'s political action committee after the union endorsed Mr. Biden. If Mr. Trump would win as a result, he said, "so be it."
I pressed him on it. Wouldn't Mr. Trump be worse for Palestinians? Didn't Benjamin Netanyahu want his buddy Mr. Trump re-elected? Mr. Beydoun paused.
"There's something to be said for that," he said. But he stood firm.
Voting makes sense only if there's a chance that your vote will matter, and he had no hope that either party would change American policy on Israel. "Whether it's a Republican or Democrat, I know they're going to stand by Israel 100 percent," he told me.
The biggest way to make his voice heard, he insisted, was to withhold his vote. "We need to make a statement to say, 'Hey, we can do this to you."'
That's the politics of betrayal. There are lots of voters like Mr. Beydoun in the metro Detroit area, which is crucial to any path to victory for Mr. Biden in the state. Wayne County, the most populous in Michigan, is home to both the United Auto Workers International headquarters and the largest Arab American community in the U.S. Thousands of Arabs settled here in the 1960s and '70s and got jobs in the Ford plants, including Mr. Beydoun's father, who came from Lebanon in 1968, beginning a decades-long tradition of political activism through their unions.
Today there are 190,000 Arabic speakers in Wayne County alone, out of about 1.8 million people. Dozens of elected leaders in the area have signed a pledge to vote uncommitted in the Feb. 27 primary in Michigan as a signal of their willingness to abandon Mr. Biden unless the administration changes course.
Now the White House is scrambling to show that it values Palestinian lives after initially questioning the Palestinian death toll in Gaza and calling demands for a cease-fire "repugnant." Last week, senior administration officials traveled to Dearborn and expressed regret, according to a leaked recording of the meeting. And the president called Israel's operation in Gaza "over the top." But those words will be seen as empty unless they are accompanied by policy changes, especially a call for a permanent end to hostilities.
In an interview, James Zogby, a founder of the Arab American Institute, said that it was difficult to motivate Arab Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because her supporters had rejected efforts to add language to the Democratic Party platform calling for an end to "occupations and illegal settlements." She still won Wayne County by about 290,000 votes -- but that margin wasn't enough to make up for losses elsewhere. She lost Michigan by fewer than 12,000 votes. (Her campaign also suffered from her association with free trade, which Bill Clinton championed in office.)
In 2020 the insults of Mr. Trump's Muslim ban and his State Department's neglect of the problem of stateless Palestinians were fresh in the minds of Arab American voters. The Biden campaign wooed them by issuing its Arab American Agenda, which said that the president "opposes annexation and settlement expansion." Mr. Biden won Wayne County by more than 332,000 votes, a margin that helped him carry Michigan by 154,000 votes.
"I hear this from people in the White House -- 'They'll come around in November,"' Mr. Zogby told me. "It's demeaning, and it's dangerous. It ignores the depth of their feelings."
Can new positive energy from unions make up for the feelings of betrayal over Gaza? I'm skeptical.

Full text: In a court filing, prosecutors say Senator Robert Menendez urged New Jersey mayors to use a coronavirus testing lab that was paying his wife.
A luxury Mercedes-Benz, gold bars, exercise equipment and stacks of cash featured prominently in a federal indictment that charged Senator Robert Menendez with accepting a sordid array of bribes.
Now, prosecutors say a diamond engagement ring for the senator's future wife, Nadine Menendez, was also part of the elaborate bribery scheme -- and a source of infighting between co-defendants who are expected to stand trial together in May.
Wael Hana, a longtime friend of Ms. Menendez's who is also charged in the alleged conspiracy, attempted to cheat her out of the full value of the ring, according to court documents filed late Monday by prosecutors in Manhattan.
In doing so, Mr. Hana, an Egyptian-American businessman who founded a halal meat company that prosecutors say was used to funnel bribes to the Menendezes, threatened to derail plans for the senator to assist the government of Egypt -- part of the complicated plot he is accused of.
"[Hana] was about to ruin things with Bob," a confidential source, who was in touch with Egyptian officials, said, according to the government's filing. "Bob who is starting to listen to us."
Mr. Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty, as have Ms. Menendez, Mr. Hana and two other defendants.
Lawyers for the senator did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and his wife's lawyers had no comment. Mr. Hana's lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, had no comment, except to say he would be responding to the government's filing in court papers due Monday.
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York, where the defendants have been charged, also declined to comment.
The new filing comes in response to the senator's request to suppress evidence seized during searches of the house he shares with Ms. Menendez in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. The senator's lawyers have said that warrants permitting the searches were overly broad and ignored evidence favorable to Mr. Menendez.
But in justifying the need for the warrants, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York offered a trove of new details about the alleged bribery plot itself.
There are snippets from secretly recorded conversations and details about where investigators found two bags filled with roughly $ 100,000 in cash each. ("In the basement of Menendez and Nadine Menendez's residence, on top of a large rack of clothes hangers," prosecutors wrote, adding, "Under the jackets were four boots, stuffed with cash, including one boot containing in excess of $ 5,000 in $ 50 bills.")
As part of the bribery plot, prosecutors said Mr. Hana arranged for carpet installation at Ms. Menendez's home. And at times, the senator placed calls to what the couple referred to as Ms. Menendez's "007" phone -- "an apparent reference to the fictional character James Bond," prosecutors wrote.
But perhaps the most unusual new detail in the filing involves an element of the lengthy federal investigation that did not appear to factor into any of the three successive indictments against Mr. Menendez, Ms. Menendez and three New Jersey businessmen.
Prosecutors noted that Mr. Menendez contacted mayors in New Jersey during the pandemic, in late 2020 and early 2021, to ask them to authorize use of a specific laboratory -- which at the time was paying Ms. Menendez -- to perform Covid-19 testing.
Taken together, prosecutors said, these details amount to "substantial evidence that Menendez did in fact know about the corrupt quid pro quo."
The engagement ring, according to prosecutors, was given to Nadine Menendez as part of a $ 150,000 bribe from a man who had enlisted Mr. Menendez's help to avoid criminal penalties after being charged with insurance fraud in New Jersey.
Part of the money went toward a new Mercedes-Benz convertible for Ms. Menendez, prosecutors said.
The new car replaced a vehicle that police records show Ms. Menendez was driving in December 2018 when she struck and killed a pedestrian, Richard Koop, in Bogota, N.J. Ms. Menendez was not tested for drugs or alcohol and was not charged with wrongdoing. The New Jersey attorney general's office has said it was reviewing the crash investigation, but has refused to respond to questions about the status of the inquiry.
Roughly $ 35,000 of the $ 150,000 bribe was intended to cover the purchase of a diamond ring, according to prosecutors.
But the ring Mr. Hana bought cost only $ 12,000. He used the excess funds to buy two watches, a bracelet and a necklace for himself, yet had the jeweler provide a receipt indicating that the ring he gave Ms. Menendez cost $ 35,000, prosecutors said.
"The Hana associate also explained that Menendez knew that Hana shortchanged him with respect to the ring, and that Nadine Menendez (the 'gander') had taken the ring back to the jeweler and learned that it was worth less money," the court filing noted, citing a code name used for Ms. Menendez.
In their filing on Monday, the Southern District prosecutors also responded sharply to an assertion by Mr. Menendez's lawyers that the case stemmed from "the government's apparent zeal to 'get back' at Senator Menendez" for his avoiding conviction in a 2017 federal corruption trial in New Jersey that ended in a hung jury and dismissal of charges against him.
The prosecutors, noting that the senator's earlier case involved different facts, a different co-defendant and a different prosecution team, called the accusation "patently false."
The prosecutors also contradicted a claim by Mr. Menendez in a sworn declaration that accused the F.B.I., which searched his house in June 2022, of leaving the home "in complete disarray." Interior doors had been forcibly broken down, furniture had been haphazardly moved around, and filing cabinets, desk drawers, dressers and closets had all been rummaged through and their contents strewn about, Mr. Menendez wrote.
Prosecutors, calling the senator's claim "at best, hyperbolic," said that although physical searches require the movement of some objects, time-stamped entry and exit photographs taken by the F.B.I.'s search team "show that the house was in substantially similar condition at the end of the search as it was in the beginning."

Heavy Truck Makers Push for Electric Vehicle Chargers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Daimler, Navistar and Volvo have been criticized for not selling many electric heavy trucks, but the companies say the country first needs many more chargers.
There are more than four million electric vehicles on American roads, but fewer than 1,000 of them are heavy-duty trucks. On Tuesday, the three largest truck makers announced a push to remedy that deficit by calling on governments and utilities to help them build many more places to charge big rigs.
Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner; Navistar, which is controlled by Volkswagen; and Volvo Group North America have formed an association to push for chargers, improvements to the electricity grid and other measures they say are needed to promote battery- or hydrogen-powered trucks.
The new organization, Powering America's Commercial Transportation, will be based in Washington and also be open to suppliers, nonprofit organizations and other groups.
The companies' decision to work together underscores the degree to which the transition away from fossil fuels is dependent on government support and decisions made in Washington and state capitols. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed in 2022, provides $ 1 billion for electric trucks, including tax credits of up to $ 40,000 for companies that buy them, as well as subsidies for charging infrastructure.
But officials are just beginning to distribute the money, and the truck companies complain that they have gotten less attention from federal and state governments than makers of cars.
"There's a lot of funding that's available out there from the federal government," said Dawn Fenton, vice president of government relations and public affairs at Volvo Group North America, which owns Volvo Trucks and Mack Trucks. "There's been little so far focused on the heavy-duty charging infrastructure."
Only nine fast charging stations in the United States are capable of serving heavy trucks, according to data from the Department of Energy.
Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gases in the United States, and trucks, buses and vans account for 29 percent of vehicle emissions, according to Calstart, a nonprofit group whose members work in industry as well as government. Poorer communities tend to suffer the most from truck pollution because they are more likely to be near industrial zones or highways.
Eliminating those emissions is difficult. An electric truck requires a big, heavy battery that reduces how much stuff the vehicle can haul.
Zero-emissions trucks are also two or three times more expensive than diesel trucks, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, although prices are expected to drop as companies increase production.
The truck makers say they are committed to selling emission-free vehicles, but environmental groups have accused them of trying to block policies that would force the industry to move faster.
This month, the Sierra Club, along with 40 other advocacy groups, sent letters to the chief executives of Daimler Truck and Volvo Group accusing them of trying to stymie stricter emissions standards. In comments on proposed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency, both truck makers have lobbied for a slower introduction of new standards.
In the letter to Volvo Group's chief executive, Martin Lundstedt, the group wrote, "Volvo Trucks U.S.A. must focus its efforts and resources on electrifying the transportation sector now, especially in the communities most impacted by truck emissions, instead of fighting policies needed to move the whole system faster." The groups sent a similar letter to Martin Daum, the chief executive of Daimler Truck.
(Volvo Group is not part of Volvo Car and Daimler Truck is separate from Mercedes-Benz.)
Truck makers face less competitive pressure than car companies. In the car business, Tesla has won over customers who previously drove cars made by Mercedes, General Motors and Volkswagen, forcing those companies to respond. The Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle was the best-selling passenger car of any kind worldwide in 2023, according to JATO Dynamics, a market research firm.
No upstart truck maker has had comparable impact. Tesla has developed a long-haul electric truck called the Semi, but the company has not begun selling it in large numbers.
"We would have moved faster over the last five years if there was a zero emission truck company taking the lead," said Katherine García, director of a Sierra Club program that promotes clean transportation.
Nikola once aimed to be the Tesla of the truck industry, but it has struggled since its founder, Trevor Milton, was accused of defrauding investors by lying about the abilities of the company's technology. Mr. Milton was sentenced in December to four years in prison after a jury convicted him. He denies wrongdoing and is appealing. Nikola, under new management, shipped 79 vehicles in the first nine months of 2023, the most recent figures the company has disclosed.
The truck makers argue that they can't be expected to sell battery-powered trucks when there are hardly any places to charge them. Electric trucks require extremely powerful chargers and, as a result, bigger connections to the electrical grid than are readily available. Many utilities have to upgrade old distribution lines, transformers and other equipment to be able to deliver the energy needed to refuel multiple trucks simultaneously.
Brien Sheahan, head of government relations and regulatory affairs at Navistar, said one customer had ordered a fleet of electric trucks and installed 20 chargers at its depot. But, he said, "they couldn't get it energized by the utility."
Shortcomings in the electrical grid are "going to be a constraint on our ability to scale the industry," said Mr. Sheahan, a former chairman and chief executive of the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates electric utilities.
Ms. García of the Sierra Club said that, despite slow progress so far, she was optimistic. She noted that sales of electric delivery vans and other smaller trucks were growing quickly, in part because California and other states are compelling manufacturers to reduce emissions and providing incentives for truck buyers.
Delivery vans, like those used by Amazon, require less energy and typically drive relatively short routes. As a result, those vehicles can be charged overnight on less powerful chargers than those needed for heavy trucks.
"The market is really moving quickly," Ms. García said. "We're at the point where it is really going to accelerate."

Menendez Says F.B.I. Ransacked His Home: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lawyers for Senator Robert Menendez seek to suppress evidence seized in searches that turned up bars of gold and half a million dollars in cash.
The initial search of Senator Robert Menendez's home occurred on a Thursday morning in June 2022 while the U.S. Senate was in session.
It was among five searches of Mr. Menendez's property and electronic devices that judges approved between January 2022 and September 2023 during a federal investigation into the senator, a Democrat from New Jersey, who at the time was chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to a new legal filing.
Information and items collected during the searches later factored heavily in a September indictment in which federal prosecutors charged Mr. Menendez with accepting cash, gold and a luxury car in exchange for political favors.
But late Monday, Mr. Menendez's lawyers argued that much of what was seized during what they called "exploratory rummaging" should be tossed out. The warrants, they said, were issued by magistrate judges duped by prosecutors who "actively distorted the evidence."
During the June 16, 2022, search, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation "ransacked" the home, Mr. Menendez's lawyers wrote. The legal brief does not specify whether it was Menendez's home in New Jersey or Washington that was raided, but the indictment indicated that a split-level house in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where Mr. Menendez lives with his wife, Nadine Menendez, was searched that day.
Neither Mr. Menendez nor his wife was home, he said in a court declaration. Records show the Senate was in session that day, but it was unclear if Mr. Menendez was in Washington.
Upon returning home, Mr. Menendez wrote, he found that investigators had rifled through filing cabinets, desk drawers, dressers, wardrobes and closets, leaving their contents haphazardly tossed about.
"I was shocked to find my belongings and furniture in complete disarray," he said.
Agents even broke down unlocked doors, he added.
Agents seized 13 bars of gold bullion, a luxury Mercedes-Benz and more than $ 550,000 in cash -- including tens of thousands of dollars stuffed in envelopes, one of which held the fingerprints of Mr. Menendez and a co-defendant accused of providing bribes, according to the indictment.
That night, prosecutors obtained another warrant to conduct a second home search.
"To obtain several of these search warrants, the government actively distorted the evidence and withheld key exculpatory information, misleading well-meaning magistrate judges into granting warrants that should never have issued," Mr. Menendez's lawyers wrote.
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment on Tuesday.
The senator, his wife and three businessmen have been charged in an elaborate yearslong bribery conspiracy. All five have pleaded not guilty, and in the last two weeks their lawyers have filed a flurry of legal motions in advance of a trial that is scheduled to start in May.
The grand jury investigation is not over, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Monday in a letter to the judge.
"Although the grand jury has returned indictments in this case, its investigation remains ongoing," the prosecutors wrote in the letter, which came in response to a request by The New York Times and Inner City Press, a website that features legal news, to disclose certain information shielded from public view.
The senator's lawyers took no position on whether the redacted material, much of which appeared to present Mr. Menendez in a more favorable light, should be made public.
Their filing on Monday also took direct aim at the government's motives.
The senator's lawyers presented the investigation as payback for the Justice Department's failure to prove earlier charges of corruption against Mr. Menendez, who was indicted in 2015 in New Jersey on unrelated bribery charges. In that case, the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict, and prosecutors declined to pursue the case after a judge tossed out the most serious charges.
"The government's apparent zeal to 'get back' at Senator Menendez for defeating its prior prosecution has overwhelmed its sound judgment," his lawyers wrote.

How the War With Hamas Damaged Israel's Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Israel's technology sector, a key part of the economy, has been jolted by worker shortages and funding fears, which could drive a wider slowdown in 2024.
At 6:45 a.m. on Oct. 7, Jack Bigio, the founder of the technology company UBQ Materials, talked to his chief operating officer, who said terrorists were on his kibbutz. Other employees texted that they were hiding in safe rooms, and one said her husband had been shot in the stomach.
"It was like doomsday," Mr. Bigio said.
The attack by Hamas on Israel forced UBQ Materials to shut its plant, 20 miles from the Gaza border, and left its work force in shock. Two employees were murdered. Many lost their homes and were relocated 100 miles away.
Founded in 2012, UBQ Materials uses technology that turns household garbage into a plastic substitute used to make tables, chairs, McDonald's trays and car parts for Mercedes-Benz. The company was able to get up and running within three weeks, but many others are facing continuing problems with operations and financing.
About 23,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since Oct. 7, according to the Gazan health ministry, which does not distinguish between deaths of civilians and fighters. About a million evacuees from the territory's north have fled south. The strip has suffered widespread destruction, with hunger; disruption of water, electricity and communications networks; and limited medical care as many hospitals have sustained damage.
In Israel, the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 killed 1,200 people and resulted in hundreds being taken hostage, including more than 100 who are still held in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities. The war has upended life, as hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers were called up, and 200,000 people have been displaced from border areas in the north and south.
In ways that are often less visible outside the country, the war has also hurt Israel's economy. Tourism has come to a virtual standstill, and government spending has jumped. The hit to tech companies has shaken confidence in a sector that has become a key driver of Israel's economy.
The call-up of 350,000 army reservists disrupted operations at many companies. Many customer orders were put on hold or canceled outright, and investors were getting cold feet, according to a survey by the Israel Innovation Authority, a government-funded agency, and the Start-Up Nation Policy Institute.
Israel's technology sector has grown rapidly over the past decade and accounts for almost half of all exports and a fifth of economic output, the Israeli Innovation Authority said.
As a result, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, the war will cause a "temporary but pronounced slowdown" of Israel's economy. It had grown about 3 percent before the Oct. 7 attacks and is now expected to slow to 1.5 percent this year. Weighing on the economy are labor shortages, lower consumer and business confidence, and higher inflation.
Another concern is foreign investment, which was already weak before Oct. 7 because of uncertainty caused by the dispute between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government and Israel's Supreme Court, said Jonathan Katz, a former economic forecaster in the Israeli Finance Ministry.
"Now the question is whether foreigners will still want to invest in Israeli high tech, or if they'd rather invest their money in some place that's safe and quiet, like Ireland," Mr. Katz said.
To stimulate the flagging economy, the Bank of Israel cut interest rates by a quarter point, to 4.5 percent, last week. It was its first rate cut since the start of the Covid pandemic, and the governor of the central bank, Amir Yaron, said additional cuts were expected.
Mr. Yaron has said that the economy was already adjusting to the war conditions and showing signs of recovery, but that the ramifications of the prolonged hostilities would be significant.
In particular, he emphasized the importance of stability and the need to rein in soaring government spending, which the central bank expects to contribute to more public debt and higher deficits.
"It is clear to us all that the current economic uncertainty is connected very closely to the security situation and how the war will develop," Mr. Yaron said.
Israel has taken several steps to tamp down the uncertainty, including stabilizing the Israeli shekel. The government is planning to increase the number of foreign workers allowed in the country to 70,000, from 50,000, to address a sudden labor shortage. Workers from abroad have fled, and more than 100,000 West Bank Palestinians have been barred from working in Israel.
In recent weeks, the military has also started withdrawing several thousand troops from the Gaza Strip, at least temporarily, in part because of the economic toll of such a massive deployment of reservists.
Still, Mr. Yaron issued a stern warning on Jan. 1 to Mr. Netanyahu over fiscal priorities at a time when more spending must be directed to defense and security and pressing domestic needs, like making the communities near the Gaza and Lebanese borders habitable after they came under attack from Hamas and Hezbollah militants. Criticism of the Netanyahu government's funding of West Bank settlements and the ultra-Orthodox has intensified since the war.
"Not acting now to adjust the budget via cuts in expenditures, removing redundant ministries and increasing revenues in view of the needs of the war is likely to cost the economy much more in the future," Mr. Yaron said.
The war in Gaza, one of the longest Israel has ever waged, is already reverberating throughout the economy.
Construction, which represents 14 percent of Israel's economy, has slowed because of the labor shortage. Though volunteers have been pitching in, the departure of foreign workers and loss of Palestinian labor have meant that fruit and vegetables were left rotting on trees and in fields.
In addition, some imports are in short supply because attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen have disrupted transport through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.
Tourism took an immediate nosedive on Oct. 8, just as it was recovering after the Covid pandemic, government officials said.
"There's nothing -- no Israeli tourists, no non-Israeli tourists, no weddings, no henna celebrations before the weddings, no house warmings. No one is celebrating," said Tomer Bent, who runs King David Treasures, a Judaica store on Jerusalem's popular Ben Yehuda street arcade, which is usually teeming with people eating pizza and falafel or having coffee at sidewalk restaurants.
"But it will get better," Mr. Bent said, and he pointed skyward. "We believe in Him."
Stores on Ben Yehuda used to stay open until midnight in late December, when American tourists visited during the winter break and Christmas holiday, said Moshe Saudi, who was staffing a souvenir shop. Now they are closing early.
The Israel Innovation Authority has $ 100 million in government funds to support technology companies, especially start-ups that have lost financing. The sector was encouraged by last month's announcement that the semiconductor giant Intel would proceed with a planned $ 25 billion investment to expand a chip factory in southern Israel, after receiving a $ 3.2 billion grant from the government.
"All our entrepreneurs understand that regardless of how much our customers abroad support us and empathize with us, if we cannot meet our commitments they have to move on," said Dror Bin, general manager of the Innovation Authority.
Shortly after the war erupted, the organization started a new promotional campaign to boost confidence in Israeli tech companies, despite the war. The slogan: "Israeli tech delivers. NO MATTER WHAT."

Menendez Asks Judge For Dismissal, Arguing The Case Goes Too Far: [National Desk]

Full text: Lawyers for Senator Robert Menendez filed a dismissal motion on Wednesday, offering a first glimpse into the New Jersey Democrat's defense strategy.
Lawyers for Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat charged with accepting cash and gold bribes, asked a judge on Wednesday to dismiss the indictment, saying overzealous prosecutors were criminalizing normal legislative activity and flouting constitutional protections afforded to members of Congress.
The arguments, contained in the first legal brief filed by Mr. Menendez's defense team, provided an early glimpse into his legal strategy four months before he is scheduled to stand trial in Manhattan on federal corruption charges.
The brief came a day after Mr. Menendez, 70, stood on the Senate floor to offer a highly unusual rebuttal to the charges outlined in three successive indictments. Prosecutors have accused him of acting as an unregistered agent of Egypt, taking bribes to help the government of Qatar, exchanging political favors for bricks of gold and trying to halt criminal investigations to help allies in New Jersey -- all points that his lawyers addressed in the filing.
"The government's accusations in this case -- that he sold his office and even sold out his nation -- are outrageously false, and indeed distort reality," Mr. Menendez's lawyers wrote. "Every official act the senator took represented his good-faith policy judgments."
The timing of the filing appears to have been no coincidence. Legal motions were not due until Jan. 15, and the lawyers, in breaking months of silence a day after the senator defiantly addressed the charges in Washington, signaled a shift in both strategy and tone.
In a statement, Adam Fee, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, said the senator should not even face a trial. "The government should be forced to end this case," Mr. Fee said, "as well as its one-sided effort to falsely tarnish the reputation that Senator Menendez built through 50 years of patriotic public service."
In arguing that the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, should dismiss the indictment, Mr. Menendez's lawyers relied on two legal principles.
They cited a 2016 Supreme Court decision that overturned the conviction of Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia, to claim that many of the senator's actions were not "official acts" and therefore were not illegal; the McDonnell ruling made it harder to prosecute public officials by narrowing the kinds of quid-pro-quo actions that could be defined as corruption.
Other conduct, Mr. Menendez's lawyers said, was protected because of legislative independence embedded in the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause.
Josh Chafetz, a law professor at Georgetown University who studies legislative procedure and the separation of powers, said the speech or debate clause was intended to operate as a kind of jurisdictional bar.
"It's meant to prevent these cases from going forward in the first place," Professor Chafetz said. "It's not just meant to be a defense that a member can raise at trial. The whole point is that even being dragged into the courtroom is itself a sort of impingement on legislative privilege."
In their brief, Mr. Menendez's lawyers argue that one charge -- acting as an agent of Egypt -- directly criminalized the senator's legislative activity, empowering the executive and judicial branches of government to "second-guess" the way he chose to engage with foreign representatives in the course of his duties. That, they said, "fundamentally disrupts the separation of powers." (Mr. Menendez served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before stepping down after he was indicted.)
Permitting the foreign-agent count to stand could mean a future administration in Washington would be free to prosecute its "legislative enemies," the lawyers argued. A lawmaker, they suggested, could be prosecuted for acting as an agent of Ukraine "for supporting aid during its war with Russia," or of Israel, "for supporting military aid to fight Hamas."
Mr. Menendez's lawyers also accused the government of belatedly disclosing critical discovery materials, of hiding "key exculpatory evidence from the public's and the court's view" and of presenting a "distorted reality."
"The government substitutes made-for-tabloid images of cash and gold bars for actual evidence of a bribery scheme," they wrote, "and manufactures a narrative based on speculation, cherry-picking and innuendo."
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan will have the opportunity to respond to the defense's arguments when prosecutors file their legal briefs in the case, which are due by Feb. 5.
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the office, declined to comment on the new filing.
In Tuesday's speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Menendez accused prosecutors of abusing the grand jury process by dribbling out new charges and details in successive indictments, a strategy he said was designed to taint the jury pool.
"I'm innocent," Mr. Menendez said in his speech, "and I intend to prove my innocence."
Mr. Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were first indicted in September on charges they took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including bars of gold bullion, in exchange for the senator's willingness to use his political influence at home and abroad. Investigators seized 13 gold bars, $ 566,000 in cash and a 2019 Mercedes-Benz during June 2022 searches of Mr. Menendez's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and a safe deposit box. Three New Jersey businessmen were also charged in the bribery scheme.
Prosecutors said the car had been given to Ms. Menendez as part of the scheme to replace a vehicle that police records show she was driving when she struck and killed a pedestrian, Richard Koop, 49, in Bogota, N.J.
Then, in mid-October, prosecutors added a new charge: that Mr. Menendez conspired to act as an agent of Egypt even as he was serving as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
A third indictment, released last week, accused him of using his political influence to benefit the government of Qatar.
All five defendants, who are each represented by separate lawyers, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

War in Ukraine Is Helping China Profit From Trade With Russia: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: On China's snowy border with Russia, a dealership that sells trucks has seen its sales double in the past year thanks to Russian customers. China's exports to its neighbor are so strong that Chinese construction workers built warehouses and 20-story office towers at the border this summer.
The border town Heihe is a microcosm of China's ever closer economic relationship with Russia. China is profiting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led Russia to switch from the West to China for purchases of everything from cars to computer chips.
Russia, in turn, has sold oil and natural gas to China at deep discounts. Russian chocolates, sausages and other consumer goods have become plentiful in Chinese supermarkets. Trade between Russia and China surpassed $ 200 billion in the first 11 months of this year, a level the countries had not expected to reach until 2024.
Russia's war in Ukraine has also gotten an image boost from China. State media disseminates a steady diet of Russian propaganda in China and around the world. Russia is so popular in China that social media influencers flock to Harbin, the capital of China's northernmost province in the east, Heilongjiang, to pose in Russian garb in front of a former Russian cathedral there.
Xi Jinping, China's top leader, and Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, have made numerous public demonstrations of the nations' close ties. Mr. Xi visited Harbin in early September and declared Heilongjiang to be China's "gateway to the north." China's exports to Russia soared 69 percent in the first 11 months of this year compared with the same period in 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine.
"Maintaining and developing China-Russian relations well is a strategic choice made by both sides on the basis of the fundamental interests of the two peoples," Mr. Xi said as he met in Beijing on Wednesday with the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin.
China has filled a critical import need for Russia, which many European and American companies shunned after Mr. Putin started his war in February 2022. China has pursued its role as a substitute supplier of goods despite risking its close economic ties with many European nations.
Before the Ukraine invasion, leaders of Germany, France and other European countries mostly set aside differences with China over issues like human rights to emphasize commerce. Chinese officials, for their part, insist that they should not be forced to choose between Europe and Russia, and that China should be free to do business with both.
The biggest winners for China from the surge in trade with Russia have been its vehicle manufacturers.
On a recent afternoon in Heihe, lines of diesel freight trucks with decals of snarling bears, a symbol of Russia, on their drivers' doors waited to be driven across an Amur River bridge to Russia. The bridge is new, and so are the trucks, which wore Genlyon badges, a brand that belongs to the state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. The company, known as SAIC, also makes car brands like MG, acquired from Britain.
The sales helped China overtake Japan this year as the world's largest car exporter. German manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW used to be strong sellers in Russia, but they have pulled out in response to sanctions on the country by Europe, the United States and their allies.
Sales of luxury cars in Russia have plunged, contributing to a decline in the overall size of the country's car market, which is now less than half the size of Germany's. But lower-middle-class and poor Russian families, whose members make up the bulk of the soldiers fighting the war, have stepped up purchases of affordable Chinese cars, according to Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
One reason, Mr. Gabuev said, are the death and disability payments that the Russian government and insurers are making to families of Russian soldiers -- as much as $ 90,000 in the case of a death.
Russia has not released the number of its killed and wounded, but the United States estimates the total at 315,000.
Russians buy almost exclusively internal combustion cars. China has a surplus of them because its consumers have shifted swiftly to electric cars.
And the land border means China can transport cars to Russia by rail, an important factor because China lacks its own fleet of transoceanic carrier ships for vehicle exports.
The result? Chinese carmakers have grabbed 55 percent of the Russian market, according to GlobalData Automotive. They had 8 percent in 2021.
"Never before have we seen automakers from a single country gobble up so much market share so quickly -- the Chinese came into a windfall," said Michael Dunne, an Asia automotive consultant in San Diego.
The United States has strongly warned China against sending armaments to Russia, and has not yet uncovered evidence that it is doing so. But some civilian equipment that China is selling to Russia, like drones and trucks, also has military uses.
Beijing's embrace of Russia has also provided a modest but timely boon to China's construction industry. The economy has struggled to heal from the scars left by almost three years of stringent "zero Covid" measures.
The real estate market is in crisis across China. Tens of millions of apartments are empty or unfinished, and new projects have stalled -- depriving the construction sector of work that has long powered jobs.
"Many buildings have been built, but without anyone living inside," said Zhang Yan, a wooden door vendor in Heihe.
But some laborers are finding work on the 2,600-mile Russian border, which until this year had a dearth of truck stops, customs processing centers, rail yards, pipelines and other infrastructure. Construction moved ahead briskly over the summer in cities like Heihe, although it has paused for the frigid winter.
Pipelines are needed for one of the most crucial commodities traded between the two countries: energy.
Cheap Russian energy, bypassing sanctions imposed by the West, has helped Chinese factories compete in global markets even as their manufacturing rivals elsewhere, notably in Germany, have faced sharply higher energy costs for much of the past two years.
Russia has been ramping up natural gas shipments through its Power of Siberia pipeline to China, and has been negotiating to build a second one that would carry gas from fields that served Europe before the Ukraine war. China and Russia also agreed less than three weeks before the Ukraine war to build a third, smaller pipeline that would carry gas from easternmost Russia to northeastern China, and construction on that project has raced ahead.
The newest pipeline will cross land that Russia seized from China in the late 1850s and never returned. As recently as the 1960s, China and the Soviet Union were quarreling over the placement of their border and their troops skirmished. In a village near Heihe, a larger-than-life-size statue of an imperial Chinese general still glares across the Amur River.
Today Russia and China are building bridges and pipelines that cross it.

Menendez Faces Another Accusation: Using Sway to Aid Qatari Government: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Federal prosecutors said Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, accepted tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to help Qatar's government.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- already accused of using his political influence to benefit Egypt -- was newly charged on Tuesday with using his power to help the government of Qatar.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said that Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, exploited his Senate office to aid a prominent New Jersey developer in securing financial backing from an investment fund run by a Qatari sheikh in exchange for lucrative bribes. The alleged payoffs included cash, gold bars, Formula 1 tickets for a relative and an offer of a designer watch.
Prosecutors said that the developer, Fred Daibes, "also expected Menendez in exchange to take action to benefit the government of Qatar, and thereby benefit Daibes, who was seeking millions of dollars in investment from a fund with ties to the government of Qatar."
The updated indictment broadens the government's allegations that Mr. Menendez, 70, who was the influential head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, used his official position to convey benefits to foreign governments in return for bricks of gold and tens of thousands of dollars in bribes. In October, prosecutors accused Mr. Menendez; his wife, Nadine Menendez; and another defendant, Wael Hana, of conspiring to have the senator work on behalf of the Egyptian government without registering with the Justice Department.
Adam Fee, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, said Tuesday that the government's new allegations "stink of desperation."
"Despite what they've touted in press releases, the government does not have the proof to back up any of the old or new allegations against Senator Menendez," Mr. Fee said. "What they have instead is a string of baseless assumptions and bizarre conjectures based on routine, lawful contacts between a senator and his constituents or foreign officials. They are turning this into a persecution, not a prosecution."
"At all times," he added, "Senator Menendez acted entirely appropriately with respect to Qatar, Egypt and the many other countries he routinely interacts with."
Mr. Daibes's lawyer, Tim Donohue, said he had no comment. Ms. Menendez's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, declined through a spokesman to comment on the new indictment.
Mr. Menendez stepped down from his Foreign Relations Committee post after he was first indicted in September, but he has resisted calls that he resign from the Senate and has not ruled out running for re-election. He and his co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty, and they are scheduled for trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in May.
The new accusations are certain to renew scrutiny not just of Mr. Menendez but also of Qatar. Investigators in Europe and the United States have spent years trying to combat sophisticated influence operations by wealthy Persian Gulf nations, including Qatar, on both sides of the Atlantic.
Belgian authorities charged a European Parliament official in 2022 as part of a sweeping investigation into Qatari bribes. American prosecutors have accused the wealthy Arab nation of bribing FIFA officials to host the 2022 World Cup, which the senator attended. (Mr. Daibes was also in Qatar during the games, court records show, but it was unclear if he attended any matches.) And just last year, the Justice Department scrutinized but ultimately decided not to charge a retired four-star Marine general who it suspected was secretly lobbying for the nation.
Mr. Daibes, the developer, had been planning a major high-rise residential project at 115 River Road in Edgewater, N.J., but the project lost its financing after getting bogged down in a delayed environmental cleanup, court records show.
Prosecutors said it was Mr. Menendez who helped craft a solution.
In June 2021, the senator introduced Mr. Daibes to an investor who was a member of the Qatari royal family and the principal of the Qatari investment company, the indictment said.
In late 2022, Mr. Daibes -- who at the time was facing unrelated federal bank fraud charges in New Jersey -- got permission to travel to London and Qatar to meet with the potential new lenders, who had signed a letter of intent to enter into a joint venture with a company controlled by Mr. Daibes.
Then, in January 2023, he finalized a $ 45 million shared-ownership agreement for the Edgewater project with a company founded by the member of Qatar's royal family, Bergen County deed records show.
A spokesman for the company, Heritage Advisors, could not be immediately reached for comment.
The new allegations against Mr. Menendez claim that during the period when the financial deal with the Qatari-linked fund was under discussion, the senator "made multiple public statements supporting the government of Qatar."
Mr. Menendez also provided Mr. Daibes with these statements so that the developer could "share them with the Qatari investor and a Qatari government official associated with the Qatari Investment Company," prosecutors said.
In September 2021, Mr. Menendez and Mr. Daibes attended a private event in Manhattan held by the Qatari government. A few days later, Mr. Daibes sent Mr. Menendez photographs of wristwatches with prices ranging from $ 9,990 to $ 23,990. "How about one of these," Mr. Daibes wrote, prosecutors said.
Within days, Mr. Daibes sent Mr. Menendez a link to a website that tracked a Senate resolution supportive of Qatar that had been introduced a day earlier and referred to the Foreign Relations Committee.
Mr. Menendez also used an encrypted messaging app to communicate directly with the Qatari investor in support of Mr. Daibes, prosecutors said. "Greetings. I understand my friend is going to visit with you," the senator wrote, adding, "I hope that this will result in the favorable and mutually beneficial agreement that you have been both engaged in discussing."
Several days after the letter of intent was signed, Mr. Daibes, Ms. Menendez and Mr. Menendez met for dinner in Edgewater, according to the indictment. Hours later, Mr. Menendez performed a Google search for "one kilo gold price."
The new indictment also suggests for the first time that the senator and his wife took steps to try to cover up other bribes they are accused of taking after federal agents raided the couple's New Jersey house in 2022.
Specifically, prosecutors said that in December 2022 the Menendezes attempted to repay tens of thousands of dollars worth of bribes that had come in the forms of payments for a home mortgage and toward a Mercedes-Benz convertible. In both cases, the couple created documentation describing the original bribes as loans they were repaying, the indictment said.

Tesla Sales Swing Back After Prices Are Slashed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024.
Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles -- provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024.
The company said on Tuesday that it sold 484,500 cars in the fourth quarter, up from 435,000 in the third quarter and 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles. The gains put Tesla on track to sell more than two million cars in 2024, potentially overtaking established carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and Renault.
The rebound in sales during the fourth quarter should help calm investor concerns about whether Tesla can defend its dominance of the market for electric vehicles as it faces increased competition from traditional carmakers.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles. Tesla accounts for half the electric cars sold in the United States. In 2022, Tesla accounted for two-thirds of the market.
Another electric vehicle maker, Rivian, said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 14,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. That number was up substantially from a year earlier but down about 10 percent from the third quarter.
In China, the largest market for electric cars, Tesla faces intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers. BYD sold 526,000 fully electric cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, exceeding Tesla, a milestone that many auto analysts had been expecting given the Chinese company's rapid growth.
Chinese automakers have moved faster in offering a wide range of affordable electric models as the market has expanded beyond the affluent early adopters of technology. They are the core customers who have bought Teslas for as long as the company has been around.
"The customers who are buying E.V.s now are second adopters, who have fundamentally different needs," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. "They care about tangible and immediately realizable decreases in total cost of ownership, and they care about convenience."
In Europe, Volkswagen and its Audi and Skoda divisions sell more electric vehicles than Tesla, although the Tesla Model Y is by far the best-selling model on the continent, according to data compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research.
In the United States, people interested in buying an electric car had a strong incentive to take delivery before the end of the year because of new rules intended to cut China out of the supply chain.
Tesla had warned on its website that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would no longer qualify for $ 7,500 federal tax credits after Dec. 31. The cars have batteries made in China. Germany and some other European countries have also rolled back subsidies for electric vehicle buyers.
To maintain sales, Tesla cut prices, offering Model 3s on its website for well under $ 30,000 after factoring in the tax credits. By late December, the number of lower-priced cars listed on the website appeared to have dwindled, suggesting that the strategy had succeeded. But the price reductions cut into Tesla profits, which fell 44 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Tesla said it would announce earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Jan. 24.
While fewer Teslas will qualify for federal tax credits in 2024, the company is in a better position than most of its competitors. The Performance version of the Model 3, which includes upgraded wheels and brakes, will remain eligible for the subsidy, as will all versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle, according to a federal government website. Tesla makes batteries for those cars at a Nevada plant operated with Panasonic, allowing it to meet domestic manufacturing requirements.
That gives Tesla a significant advantage over competitors like Ford, which has said that its Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicle will not qualify for the credit in the new year.
Ford and others rely on manufacturers in China for crucial components. Ford is building battery factories in the United States, but they will not begin producing until 2025.
General Motors has been building batteries at a new factory in Ohio, but has struggled to get the plant operating at full capacity. Initially only the Chevrolet Bolt will qualify for tax credits, G.M. said in December. The Cadillac Lyriq and electric Chevrolet Blazer will no longer be eligible.
G.M. has said it is adjusting its supply chain so that those and other vehicles, including electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Equinox sport utility vehicle, will become eligible early in the year.
Tesla and other carmakers may also benefit from lower interest rates in the new year. Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will start to ratchet down rates as inflation cools.

Menendez Faces a New Accusation: Aiding the Qatari Government

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. — already accused of using his political influence to benefit Egypt — was newly charged Tuesday with using his power to help the government of Qatar.
Federal prosecutors in New York City said that Menendez exploited his Senate office to aid a prominent New Jersey developer in securing financial backing from an investment fund run by a Qatari sheikh in exchange for lucrative bribes. The alleged payoffs included cash, gold bars, Formula One tickets for a relative and an offer of a designer watch.
Prosecutors said the developer, Fred Daibes, “also expected Menendez in exchange to take action to benefit the government of Qatar, and thereby benefit Daibes, who was seeking millions of dollars in investment from a fund with ties to the government of Qatar.”
The updated indictment broadens the government’s allegations that Menendez, 70, who was the influential head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, used his official position to convey benefits to foreign governments in return for bricks of gold and tens of thousands of dollars in bribes. In October, prosecutors accused Menendez; his wife, Nadine Menendez; and another defendant, Wael Hana, of conspiring to have the senator work on behalf of the Egyptian government without registering with the Justice Department.
Adam Fee, a lawyer for Menendez, said Tuesday that the government’s new allegations “stink of desperation.”
“Despite what they’ve touted in press releases, the government does not have the proof to back up any of the old or new allegations against Sen. Menendez,” Fee said. “What they have instead is a string of baseless assumptions and bizarre conjectures based on routine, lawful contacts between a senator and his constituents or foreign officials. They are turning this into a persecution, not a prosecution.”
“At all times,” he added, “Sen. Menendez acted entirely appropriately with respect to Qatar, Egypt and the many other countries he routinely interacts with.”
Daibes’ lawyer, Tim Donohue, said he had no comment. Nadine Menendez’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, declined through a spokesperson to comment on the new indictment.
Menendez stepped down from his Foreign Relations Committee post after he was first indicted in September, but he has resisted calls that he resign from the Senate and has not ruled out running for reelection. He and his co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty, and they are scheduled for trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in May.
The new accusations are certain to renew scrutiny not just of Menendez but also of Qatar. Investigators in Europe and the United States have spent years trying to combat sophisticated influence operations by wealthy Persian Gulf nations, including Qatar, on both sides of the Atlantic.
Belgian authorities charged a European Parliament official in 2022 as part of a sweeping investigation into Qatari bribes. U.S. prosecutors have accused the wealthy Arab nation of bribing FIFA officials to host the 2022 World Cup, which the senator attended. (Daibes was also in Qatar during the games, court records show, but it was unclear if he attended any matches.) And just last year, the Justice Department scrutinized but ultimately decided not to charge a retired four-star Marine general who it suspected was secretly lobbying for the nation.
Daibes had been planning a major high-rise residential project at 115 River Road in Edgewater, New Jersey, but the project lost its financing after getting bogged down in a delayed environmental cleanup, court records show.
Prosecutors said it was Menendez who helped craft a solution.
In June 2021, the senator introduced Daibes to an investor who was a member of the Qatari royal family and the principal of the Qatari Investment Co., the indictment said.
In late 2022, Daibes — who at the time was facing unrelated federal bank fraud charges in New Jersey — got permission to travel to London and Qatar to meet with the potential new lenders, who had signed a letter of intent to enter into a joint venture with a company controlled by Daibes.
Then, in January 2023, he finalized a $45 million shared-ownership agreement for the Edgewater project with a company founded by the member of Qatar’s royal family, Bergen County deed records show.
A spokesperson for the company, Heritage Advisors, could not be immediately reached for comment.
The new allegations against Menendez claim that during the period when the financial deal with the Qatari-linked fund was under discussion, the senator “made multiple public statements supporting the government of Qatar.”
Menendez also provided Daibes with these statements so that the developer could “share them with the Qatari investor and a Qatari government official associated with the Qatari Investment Company,” prosecutors said.
In September 2021, Menendez and Daibes attended a private event in Manhattan held by the Qatari government. A few days later, Daibes sent Menendez photographs of wristwatches with prices ranging from $9,990 to $23,990. “How about one of these,” Daibes wrote, prosecutors said.
Within days, Daibes sent Menendez a link to a website that tracked a Senate resolution supportive of Qatar that had been introduced a day earlier and referred to the Foreign Relations Committee.
Menendez also used an encrypted messaging app to communicate directly with the Qatari investor in support of Daibes, prosecutors said. “Greetings. I understand my friend is going to visit with you,” the senator wrote, adding, “I hope that this will result in the favorable and mutually beneficial agreement that you have been both engaged in discussing.”
Several days after the letter of intent was signed, Daibes and the Menendezes met for dinner in Edgewater, according to the indictment. Hours later, Menendez performed a Google search for “one kilo gold price.”
The new indictment also suggests for the first time that the senator and his wife took steps to try to cover up other bribes they are accused of taking after federal agents raided the couple’s New Jersey house in 2022.
Specifically, prosecutors said that in December 2022 the Menendezes attempted to repay tens of thousands of dollars worth of bribes that had come in the forms of payments for a home mortgage and toward a Mercedes-Benz convertible. In both cases, the couple created documentation describing the original bribes as loans they were repaying, the indictment said.

Bright New Rest Stops for Sunday Drive, but Maybe Pack a Lunch: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New York's overhaul of its busy Thruway stops includes several Chick-fil-A restaurants. But lawmakers appear to be too late to force a change in the chain's business hours.
Kelli Bogacz had just spent a week camping in the Adirondack Mountains, and as she and her husband negotiated the five-hour drive back home to Buffalo, all they wanted was something to eat.
Halfway through their journey, an oasis appeared: Chittenango Travel Plaza, a newly renovated rest stop on Interstate 90, just east of Syracuse. Yet as they pulled their pickup truck and 23-foot camper into the parking lot, they sensed a problem.
It was a Sunday afternoon last August. The only restaurant inside the rest stop was a Chick-fil-A. And, as anyone halfway familiar with the American fast food landscape knows, Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays.
"So it was useless," said Ms. Bogacz, 54, a sixth-grade teacher. "Utterly useless."
The 27 rest stops that line the 570-mile-long New York Thruway are being systematically renovated now as part of a $ 450 million private investment plan. The project, which kicked off two years ago, has brought freshly gleaming facilities and a host of new businesses, like Shake Shack, Panda Express and, yes, Chick-fil-A.
But the developments have left some motorists, like Ms. Bogacz, frustrated and hungry -- and now lawmakers in New York have taken up their cause, asking why many of the state's rest stops now feature a restaurant that is famously closed on one of the busiest travel days of the week.
This month, lawmakers introduced a new bill that would require service area restaurants along the Thruway to open seven days a week. The proposal, like many things involving Chick-fil-A, has set off a minor political firestorm, with critics accusing the state's Democratic legislators of attempting to force the chicken chain to upend its values.
The lawmakers say they are not targeting Chick-fil-A, which has frequently attracted controversy for the conservative Christian values of its chairman, Dan T. Cathy, who has spoken publicly against same-sex marriage. They just want to keep drivers fed.
"When they're closed on one of the busiest travel days of the week, they're not servicing the public like they should," Emma Johnson, a spokeswoman for Assemblyman Tony Simone, who introduced the bill, said about the rest stop restaurants.
The issue dates back to 2021, when the New York State Thruway Authority invited bids for the right to operate its 27 service areas. The eventual winner was Applegreen, an Irish convenience store conglomerate, which pledged to fund a $ 450 million renovation plan and in return was awarded a 33-year contract to manage the sites.
The refurbished rest stops are reopening, one by one, to mixed reviews: While some facilities are garnering praise for their makeovers, others have been dogged by complaints about cramped corridors and insufficient bathrooms.
Applegreen, as part of the project, has thus far opened seven Chick-fil-A restaurants at rest stops along the Thruway, with three more to come soon.
Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for the Thruway Authority, said that the contract required Applegreen to offer at least one hot and cold food option 24 hours a day at all service plazas. She noted that the Chittenango Travel Plaza (where the Bogacz family was forced to skip lunch) was the only facility out of the 27 where Chick-fil-A was the sole restaurant option. (Chittenango also has a Starbucks coffee shop.)
She pointed out, too, that selecting specific restaurants was not the authority's responsibility.
"Those restaurant contracts are with Applegreen," she said. "They determine their own tenant plan."
In a statement, an Applegreen spokesman said the company aimed to deliver "a range of food brand offerings to provide choice for customers." Regarding the rest stops with Chick-fil-A restaurants, he added, "In each of those 10 locations, alternative hot and cold food options are always available seven days a week, 24 hours a day to ensure that our customers' needs are fully met."
The bill has angered those who believe the lawmakers are trying to force Chick-fil-A to open on Sundays, altering a policy the company has maintained since 1946, according to its website, which allows employees to rest and "worship if they choose."
"This is war," Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina wrote on X last week, in support of the chicken chain, as news of the bill began to circulate on social media. He threatened to introduce legislation withholding federal funds from any state or city that required Chick-fil-A to operate on Sundays.
On Wednesday, in New York, Senator Graham kept going, posing for pictures at a Chick-fil-A in Manhattan and criticizing the bill during an appearance on Fox News.
But the bill in fact would not force Chick-fil-A to open on Sundays.
As written, the bill applies only to "all future contracts for food concessions at transportation facilities owned by the Thruway Authority, as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey." Its sponsors confirmed on Wednesday that this meant the Thruway's seven Chick-fil-A restaurants -- and any additional locations opened by Applegreen under the current contract -- could stay closed on Sundays, even if the bill passed.
The sponsors acknowledged that they were not fans of the chain or its social views. But they said they were more concerned in this case about protecting rest areas as a public good.
"We're not talking about businesses on the corner of Main Street," said State Senator Michelle Hinchey, who introduced a version of the bill in the Senate. "We're talking about restaurants on the Thruway that are meant to be open to provide food and nourishment, fast food or otherwise, when we need it."
Ms. Hinchey, who represents a rural district bisected by the Thruway, said her constituents were excited about the renovation project. But she had heard from some who were frustrated by long lines and the lack of dining options on Sundays.
Headquartered in Georgia, Chick-fil-A has more than 3,000 locations nationwide and is beloved by many. But it has attracted plenty of detractors, too. In recent years, separate proposals to open Chick-fil-A restaurants inside airports in Buffalo and San Antonio were scrapped following public pushback.
In 2021, when Applegreen was first awarded the contract, a different group of lawmakers in New York wrote letters to the Thruway Authority and the governor asking them to reconsider including Chick-fil-A in the highway's rest stops in light of the chain's past support of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. causes. They did not mention the chain's unusual business hours.
The company was heavily criticized in the past for donations to groups that sought to stop the legalization of same-sex marriage. But under pressure, the company stopped such donations, and more recently has come under fire from conservatives for its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Chick-fil-A did not respond to requests for comment, but the restaurant chain in the past has denied having any political or social agenda.
The company, for its part, has consistently adhered to its values. The chain, for example, operates a location inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons, that was closed for all eight of the football team's home games this season, which took place on Sundays. (The stadium hosts other events throughout the year.)
The chain's foothold along New York's highways should be secure for the foreseeable future, too, no matter the fate of the new bill. With three decades left on Applegreen's lease, any new rules would potentially not become relevant until the 2050s.
Until then, hungry road trippers in New York may have to hunt a bit for lunch.
"I like Chick-fil-A, and I would have enjoyed some Chick-fil-A that day," said Ms. Bogacz about her drive home from the Adirondacks. "We drove further down and hit a McDonald's that was open."

Full text: After almost 10 years of marriage, Christine Dowdall wanted out. Her husband was no longer the charming man she had fallen in love with. He had become narcissistic, abusive and unfaithful, she said. After one of their fights turned violent in September 2022, Ms. Dowdall, a real estate agent, fled their home in Covington, La., driving her Mercedes-Benz C300 sedan to her daughter's house near Shreveport, five hours away. She filed a domestic abuse report with the police two days later.
Her husband, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, didn't want to let her go. He called her repeatedly, she said, first pleading with her to return, and then threatening her. She stopped responding to him, she said, even though he texted and called her hundreds of times.
Ms. Dowdall, 59, started occasionally seeing a strange new message on the display in her Mercedes, about a location-based service called "mbrace." The second time it happened, she took a photograph and searched for the name online.
"I realized, oh my God, that's him tracking me," Ms. Dowdall said.
"Mbrace" was part of "Mercedes me" -- a suite of connected services for the car, accessible via a smartphone app. Ms. Dowdall had only ever used the Mercedes Me app to make auto loan payments. She hadn't realized that the service could also be used to track the car's location. One night, when she visited a male friend's home, her husband sent the man a message with a thumbs-up emoji. A nearby camera captured his car driving in the area, according to the detective who worked on her case.
Ms. Dowdall called Mercedes customer service repeatedly to try to remove her husband's digital access to the car, but the loan and title were in his name, a decision the couple had made because he had a better credit score than hers. Even though she was making the payments, had a restraining order against her husband and had been granted sole use of the car during divorce proceedings, Mercedes representatives told her that her husband was the customer so he would be able to keep his access. There was no button she could press to take away the app's connection to the vehicle.
"This is not the first time that I've heard something like this," one of the representatives told Ms. Dowdall.
A spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz said the company did not comment on "individual customer matters."
A car, to its driver, can feel like a sanctuary. A place to sing favorite songs off key, to cry, to vent or to drive somewhere no one knows you're going.
But in truth, there are few places in our lives less private.
Modern cars have been called "smartphones with wheels" because they are internet-connected and have myriad methods of data collection, from cameras and seat weight sensors to records of how hard you brake and corner. Most drivers don't realize how much information their cars are collecting and who has access to it, said Jen Caltrider, a privacy researcher at Mozilla who reviewed the privacy policies of more than 25 car brands and found surprising disclosures, such as Nissan saying it might collect information about "sexual activity."
"People think their car is private," Ms. Caltrider said. "With a computer, you know where the camera is and you can put tape over it. Once you've bought a car and you find it is bad at privacy, what are you supposed to do?"
Privacy advocates are concerned by how car companies are using and sharing consumers' data -- with insurance companies, for example -- and drivers' inability to turn the data collection off. California's privacy regulator is investigating the auto industry.
For car owners, the upside of this data-palooza has come in the form of smartphone apps that allow them to check a car's location when, say, they forget where it is parked; to lock and unlock the vehicle remotely; and to turn it on or off. Some apps can even remotely set the car's climate controls, make the horn honk or turn on its lights. After setting up the app, the car's owner can grant access to a limited number of other drivers.
Domestic violence experts say that these convenience features are being weaponized in abusive relationships, and that car makers have not been willing to assist victims. This is particularly complicated when the victim is a co-owner of the car, or not named on the title.
Detective Kelly Downey of the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office, who investigated Ms. Dowdall's husband for stalking, also reached out to Mercedes more than a dozen times to no avail, she said. She had previously dealt with another case of harassment via a connected car app -- a woman whose husband would turn on her Lexus while it sat in the garage in the middle of the night. In that case, too, Detective Downey was unable to get the car company to turn off the husband's access; the victim sold her car.
"Automobile manufacturers have to create a way for us to stop it," Detective Downey said. "Technology may be our godsend, but it's also very scary because it could hurt you."
Mercedes also failed to respond to a search warrant, Detective Downey said. She instead found evidence that the husband was using the Mercedes Me app by obtaining records of his internet activity.
Unable to get help from Mercedes, Ms. Dowdall took her car to an independent mechanic this year and paid $ 400 to disable the remote tracking. This also disabled the car's navigation system and its S.O.S. button, a tool to get help in an emergency.
"I didn't care. I just didn't want him to know where I was," said Ms. Dowdall, whose husband died by suicide last month. "Car manufacturers should give the ability to turn this tracking off."
Eva Galperin, an expert on tech-enabled domestic abuse at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that she has seen another case of an abuser using a car app to track a victim's movements, and that the victim didn't realize it because she "isn't the one who has set it up."
"As far as I know, there are not any guides for how to lock your partner out of your car after you break up," Ms. Galperin said.
Controlling partners have tracked their victims' cars in the past using GPS devices and Apple AirTags, Ms. Galperin said, but connected car apps offer new opportunities for harassment.
A San Francisco man used his remote access to the Tesla Model X sport utility vehicle he co-owned with his wife to harass her after they separated, according to a lawsuit she filed anonymously in San Francisco Superior Court in 2020. (Reuters previously reported on the case.)
According to a legal complaint against her husband and Tesla, the car's lights and horns were activated in a parking garage. On hot days, she would arrive at her car and discover the heat was running so that it was uncomfortably hot, while on cold days, she would find that the air-conditioner had been activated from afar. Her husband, she said in court documents, used the location-finding feature on the Tesla to identify her new residence, which she had hoped to keep secret from him.
The woman, who obtained a restraining order against her husband, contacted Tesla numerous times to get her husband's access to the car revoked -- she included some of the emails in legal filings -- but was not successful.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. In legal filings, Tesla denied responsibility for the harassment; questioned whether it had occurred, based on the husband's denials; and raised questions about the woman's reliability. (Some of what she claimed her husband had done, such as turning on songs with disturbing lyrics while she was driving, could not be done via the Tesla app.)
"Virtually every major automobile manufacturer offers a mobile app with similar functions for their customers," Tesla's lawyers wrote in a legal filing. "It is illogical and impractical to expect Tesla to monitor every vehicle owner's mobile app for misuse."
A judge dismissed Tesla from the case, stating that it would be "onerous" to expect car manufacturers to determine which claims of app abuse were legitimate.
Katie Ray-Jones, the chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said abusive partners used a wide variety of internet-connected devices -- from laptops to smart home products -- to track and harass their victims. Technology that keep tabs on a person's movements is of particular concern to domestic violence shelters, she said, because they "try to keep the shelter location confidential."
As a preventative measure, Ms. Ray-Jones encourages people in relationships to have equal access to technologies used to control their homes and belongings.
"If there's an app that is controlling your automobile, you both need to have access to that," she said.
Adam Dodge, a former family law attorney turned digital safety trainer, called car app stalking "a blind spot for victims and automakers."
"Most victims I've talked to are wholly unaware that the car they rely on is app-connected in the first place," he said. "They can't address threats they don't know are there."
As a possible solution to the problem, he and other domestic violence experts pointed to the Safe Connections Act, a recent federal law that allows victims of domestic abuse to easily sever their phone from accounts shared with their abusers. A similar law should extend to cars, Mr. Dodge said, allowing people with protective orders from a court to easily cut off an abuser's digital access to their car.
"Having access to a car for a victim is a lifeline," he said. "No victim should have to make the choice between being stalked by the car or having no car. But that's the crossroads many of them find themselves at."

After almost 10 years of marriage, Christine Dowdall wanted out. Her husband was no longer the charming man she had fallen in love with. He had become narcissistic, abusive and unfaithful, she said. After one of their fights turned violent in September 2022, Dowdall, a real estate agent, fled their home in Covington, Louisiana, driving her Mercedes-Benz C300 sedan to her daughter’s house near Shreveport, five hours away. She filed a domestic abuse report with police two days later.
Her husband, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, didn’t want to let her go. He called her repeatedly, she said, first pleading with her to return, and then threatening her. She stopped responding to him, she said, even though he texted and called her hundreds of times.
Dowdall, 59, started occasionally seeing a strange new message on the display in her Mercedes, about a location-based service called “mbrace.” The second time it happened, she took a photograph and searched for the name online.
“I realized, oh, my God, that’s him tracking me,” Dowdall said.
“Mbrace” was part of “Mercedes me” — a suite of connected services for the car, accessible via a smartphone app. Dowdall had only ever used the Mercedes Me app to make auto loan payments. She hadn’t realized that the service could also be used to track the car’s location. One night, when she visited a male friend’s home, her husband sent the man a message with a thumbs-up emoji. A nearby camera captured his car driving in the area, according to the detective who worked on her case.
Dowdall called Mercedes customer service repeatedly to try to remove her husband’s digital access to the car, but the loan and title were in his name, a decision the couple had made because he had a better credit score than hers. Even though she was making the payments, had a restraining order against her husband and had been granted sole use of the car during divorce proceedings, Mercedes representatives told her that her husband was the customer so he would be able to keep his access. There was no button she could press to take away the app’s connection to the vehicle.
“This is not the first time that I’ve heard something like this,” one of the representatives told Dowdall.
A spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz said the company did not comment on “individual customer matters.”
A car, to its driver, can feel like a sanctuary. A place to sing favorite songs off-key, to cry, to vent or to drive somewhere no one knows you’re going.
But in truth, there are few places in our lives less private.
Modern cars have been called “smartphones with wheels” because they are internet-connected and have myriad methods of data collection, from cameras and seat weight sensors to records of how hard you brake and corner. Most drivers don’t realize how much information their cars are collecting and who has access to it, said Jen Caltrider, a privacy researcher at Mozilla who reviewed the privacy policies of more than 25 car brands and found surprising disclosures, such as Nissan saying it might collect information about “sexual activity.”
“People think their car is private,” Caltrider said. “With a computer, you know where the camera is and you can put tape over it. Once you’ve bought a car and you find it is bad at privacy, what are you supposed to do?”
Privacy advocates are concerned by how car companies are using and sharing consumers’ data — with insurance companies, for example — and drivers’ inability to turn the data collection off. California’s privacy regulator is investigating the auto industry.
For car owners, the upside of this data-palooza has come in the form of smartphone apps that allow them to check a car’s location when, say, they forget where it is parked; to lock and unlock the vehicle remotely; and to turn it on or off. Some apps can even remotely set the car’s climate controls, make the horn honk or turn on its lights. After setting up the app, the car’s owner can grant access to a limited number of other drivers.
Domestic violence experts say that these convenience features are being weaponized in abusive relationships, and that carmakers have not been willing to assist victims. This is particularly complicated when the victim is a co-owner of the car or not named on the title.
Detective Kelly Downey of the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office, who investigated Dowdall’s husband for stalking, also reached out to Mercedes more than a dozen times to no avail, she said. She had previously dealt with another case of harassment via a connected car app — a woman whose husband would turn on her Lexus while it sat in the garage in the middle of the night.

Unable to get help from Mercedes, Dowdall took her car to an independent mechanic this year and paid $400 to disable the remote tracking. This also disabled the car’s navigation system and its SOS button, a tool to get help in an emergency.

How Putin Turned a Western Boycott Into a War Chest Bonanza: [World]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

U.A.W. Says 3 Carmakers Violated Labor Laws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

Full text: For 74 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been America's most important military alliance. Presidents of both parties have seen NATO as a force multiplier enhancing the influence of the United States by uniting countries on both sides of the Atlantic in a vow to defend one another.
Donald J. Trump has made it clear that he sees NATO as a drain on American resources by freeloaders. He has held that view for at least a quarter of a century.
In his 2000 book, "The America We Deserve," Mr. Trump wrote that "pulling back from Europe would save this country millions of dollars annually." As president, he repeatedly threatened a United States withdrawal from the alliance.
Yet as he runs to regain the White House, Mr. Trump has said precious little about his intentions. His campaign website contains a single cryptic sentence: "We have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally re-evaluating NATO's purpose and NATO's mission." He and his team refuse to elaborate.
That vague line has generated enormous uncertainty and anxiety among European allies and American supporters of the country's traditional foreign-policy role.
European ambassadors and think tank officials have been making pilgrimages to associates of Mr. Trump to inquire about his intentions. At least one ambassador, Finland's Mikko Hautala, has reached out directly to Mr. Trump and sought to persuade him of his country's value to NATO as a new member, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
In interviews over the past several months, more than a half-dozen current and former European diplomats -- speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from Mr. Trump should he win -- said alarm was rising on Embassy Row and among their home governments that Mr. Trump's return could mean not just the abandonment of Ukraine, but a broader American retreat from the continent and a gutting of the Atlantic alliance.
"There is great fear in Europe that a second Trump presidency would result in an actual pullout of the United States from NATO," said James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral who was NATO's supreme allied commander from 2009 to 2013. "That would be an enormous strategic and historic failure on the part of our nation."
Formed after World War II to keep the peace in Europe and act as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, NATO evolved into an instrument through which the U.S. works with allies on military issues around the world. Its original purpose -- the heart of which is the collective-defense provision, known as Article V, that states that an armed attack on any member "shall be considered an attack against them all" -- lives on, especially for newer members like Poland and the Baltic States that were once dominated by the Soviet Union and continue to fear Russia.
The interviews with current and former diplomats revealed that European officials were mostly out of ideas for how to deal with Mr. Trump other than returning to a previous playbook of flattery and transactional tributes.
Smaller countries that are more vulnerable to Russian attacks are expected to try to buy their way into Mr. Trump's good graces by increasing their orders of American weapons or -- as Poland did during his term -- by performing grand acts of adulation, including offering to name a military base Fort Trump in return for his placing a permanent presence there.
At this point in the campaign, Mr. Trump is focused on the criminal cases against him and on defeating his Republican primary rivals, and he rarely talks about the alliance, even in private.
As he maintains a broad lead in his campaign to become the Republican nominee, the implications for America's oldest and most critical military alliance are not clearly advertised plans from Mr. Trump, but a turmoil of widely held suspicions charged with unknowability.
Ukraine
Amid those swirling doubts, one thing is likely: The first area where Mr. Trump's potential return to the White House in 2025 could provoke a foreign policy crisis is for Ukraine and the alliance of Western democracies that have been supporting its defense against Russia's invasion.
Helping Ukraine stave off the attempted Russian conquest has become a defining NATO effort. Ukraine is not a NATO member but has remained an independent country because of NATO support.
Camille Grand, who was NATO's assistant secretary general for defense investment early in the war, said that how Mr. Trump handled Ukraine would be the first "big test case" that Europeans would use to assess how reliable an ally -- or not -- he might be in a second term.
"Will he throw Zelensky under the bus in the first three months of his term?" Mr. Grand, now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, asked, referring to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly declared that he would somehow settle the war "in 24 hours." He has not said how, but he has coupled that claim with suggestions that he could have prevented the war by making a deal in which Ukraine simply ceded to Russia its eastern lands that President Vladimir Putin has illegally seized.
Mr. Zelensky has said Ukraine would never agree to cede any of its lands to Russia as part of a peace deal. But Mr. Trump would have tremendous leverage over Ukraine's government. The United States has supplied huge quantities of vital weapons, ammunition and intelligence to Ukraine. European countries have pledged the most economic assistance to Ukraine but could not make up the shortfall if America stopped sending military aid.
Some of Mr. Trump's congressional allies, who have followed his lead in preaching an "America First" mantra, already oppose sending further military assistance to Kyiv. And in a broader sign of waning support, Senate Republicans last week blocked an emergency spending bill to further fund the war in Ukraine after demanding unrelated immigration policy concessions from Democrats as a condition of passing it.
But even if Congress appropriates further aid, Mr. Trump could withhold delivery of it -- as he did in 2019 when trying to coerce Mr. Zelensky into announcing a criminal investigation into Mr. Biden, the abuse-of-power scandal that led to Mr. Trump's first impeachment.
Against that backdrop, Russia's battlefield strategy for now appears to be biding its time; it is carrying out attacks when it sees opportunities and to tie up Ukrainian forces but is not making paradigm-shifting moves or negotiating, officials said. That stasis raises the possibility that Mr. Putin has calculated he could be in a much better position after the 2024 U.S. election.
'Everybody Owes Us Money'
Mr. Trump likes to brag that he privately told leaders of NATO countries that if Russia attacked them and they had not paid the money they owed to NATO and to the United States, he would not defend them. He claimed at a rally in October that after he had declared that "everybody owes us money" and was "delinquent," he made that threat at a meeting and so "hundreds of billions of dollars came flowing in."
That story is garbled at best.
There was a spending-related dispute, but it was over Europeans' meeting their spending commitments to their own militaries, not money they somehow owed to NATO or to the United States. They did increase military spending during the Trump administration -- though by nowhere near the amounts Mr. Trump has claimed. And their spending rose significantly more in 2023, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But Mr. Trump's exuberance for retelling his story, coupled with his past displeasure with NATO, is giving fresh alarm to NATO supporters.
Pressed by The New York Times to explain what he means by "fundamentally re-evaluating" NATO's mission and purpose, Mr. Trump provided a rambling statement that contained no clear answer but expressed skepticism about alliances.
"It is the obligation of every U.S. president to ensure that America's alliances serve to protect the American people, and do not recklessly endanger American blood and treasure," Mr. Trump's statement read.
Some Trump supporters who are pro-NATO have argued that Mr. Trump is bluffing. They said he was merely looking to put more pressure on the Europeans to spend more on their own defense.
"He's not going to do that," Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a Trump supporter, said of the prospect of Mr. Trump's withdrawing from NATO. "But what he will do is, he will make people pay more, and I think that will be welcome news to a lot of folks."
Robert O'Brien, who served as Mr. Trump's final national security adviser, echoed that view.
"President Trump withdrawing from NATO is an issue that some people in D.C. discuss, but I don't believe it's a real thing," Mr. O'Brien said. "He understands the military value of the alliance to America, but he just feels -- correctly, I might add -- like we're getting played by the Germans and other nations that refuse to pay their fair share for their own defense."
But John Bolton, a conservative hawk who served as national security adviser from 2018 to 2019, wrote in his memoir that Mr. Trump had to be repeatedly talked out of withdrawing from NATO. In an interview, Mr. Bolton said "there is no doubt in my mind" that in a second term, Mr. Trump would withdraw the United States from NATO.
As a legal matter, whether Mr. Trump could unilaterally withdraw the United States from NATO is likely to be contested.
The Constitution requires Senate consent to ratify a treaty but omits procedures to annul one. This has led to debate about whether presidents can do so on their own or need lawmakers' authorization. There are only a few court precedents regarding the issue, none definitive.
Decisions to revoke treaties by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 and by President George W. Bush in 2001 led members of Congress to file lawsuits that were rejected by courts, partly on the grounds that the disputes were a "political question" for the elected branches to work out. While the legal precedents are not perfectly clear, both of those presidents effectively won: the treaties are widely understood to be void. Still, any attempt to withdraw from NATO would likely invite a broader challenge.
In reaction to Mr. Trump's threats, some lawmakers -- led by Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida -- put a provision in the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which Congress is likely to vote on this month. It says the president shall not withdraw the United States from NATO without congressional approval. But whether the Constitution permits such a tying of a president's hands is also contestable.
And European diplomats say that even if Mr. Trump were to nominally keep the United States in NATO, they fear that he could so undermine trust in the United States' reliability to live up to the collective-defense provision that its value as a deterrent to Russia would be lost.
A Transactional Attitude
The uncertainty stemming from Mr. Trump's maximalist and yet vague rhetoric is bound up in his past displays of consistent skepticism about NATO and of unusual solicitude to Russia.
As a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump rattled NATO allies by saying that if Russia attacked the Baltic States, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether they had "fulfilled their obligations to us." He also repeatedly praised Mr. Putin and said he would consider recognizing Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.
As president in July 2018, Mr. Trump not only nearly withdrew from NATO at an alliance summit but denounced the European Union as a "foe" because of "what they do to us in trade." He then attended a summit with Mr. Putin, after which he expressed skepticism about the idea that the United States should go to war to defend a tiny NATO ally, Montenegro.
With no prior experience in the military or government, Mr. Trump brought a transactional, mercantilist attitude to interactions with allies. He tended to base his views of foreign nations on his personal relationships with their leaders and on trade imbalances.
Mr. Trump particularly disliked Angela Merkel, the former German chancellor, and often complained that German automakers were flooding America with their products. His defenders say his anger was in some ways justified: Germany hadn't been meeting its military spending commitments, and over his objections, Ms. Merkel pushed ahead with a natural-gas pipeline to Russia. Germany only suspended that project two days before Russia invaded Ukraine.
Mr. Trump's allies also point out that he approved sending antitank weapons to Ukraine, which President Obama had not done after Russia seized Crimea in 2014.
Still, in 2020, Mr. Trump decided to withdraw a third of the 36,000 American troops stationed in Germany. Some were to come home, as he preferred, with others redeployed elsewhere in Europe. But the following year, as Russia built up troops on Ukraine's border, Mr. Biden canceled the decision and added troops in Germany as a show of support for NATO.
A Supportive Movement
If he returns to power, Mr. Trump will be backed by a conservative movement that has become more skeptical of allies and of U.S. involvement abroad.
Anti-interventionist foreign policy institutes are more organized and better funded than they were during Mr. Trump's time in office. Those groups include the Center for Renewing America, a Trump-aligned think tank that published a paper titled "Pivoting the U.S. Away From Europe to a Dormant NATO," which provides a rationale for minimizing America's role in NATO.
On Nov. 1, the Heritage Foundation -- a traditionally hawkish conservative think tank that has lately refashioned itself in a Trumpist mold, on matters including opposition to aid to Ukraine -- hosted a delegation from the European Council on Foreign Relations.
The Europeans exchanged views with ardent nationalists, including Michael Anton, a National Security Council official in the Trump administration; Dan Caldwell, who managed foreign policy at the Center for Renewing America; and national security aides to Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and other Trump-aligned senators.
According to two people who attended, Mr. Anton told the Europeans he could imagine Mr. Trump setting an ultimatum: If NATO members did not sufficiently increase their military spending by a deadline, he would withdraw the United States from the alliance. As the meeting broke up, Eckart von Klaeden, a former German politician who is now a Mercedes-Benz Group executive, implored Mr. Anton to ask Mr. Trump to please talk to America's European allies as he formulated his foreign policy.
That seems like wishful thinking.
In his statement to The Times, Mr. Trump invoked his slogan "America First" -- a phrase once popularized by American isolationists opposed to getting involved in World War II.
"My highest priority," Mr. Trump said in the statement, "has always been, and will remain, to America first -- the defense of our own country, our own borders, our own values, and our own people, including their jobs and well-being."

Full text: The composer's latest work, "Theta," born of the pandemic, loss and long swims in open water, is premiering in Germany.
In early March 2020, the composer Jay Schwartz traveled to San Diego from his home in Cologne, Germany, to attend the funeral for Don Bukovich -- his stepfather and the only person in his extended family with an affinity for classical music.
Bukovich was especially fond of music by Bach. And, when the pandemic hit and Schwartz got stuck in San Diego and stayed with his brother, he found himself playing Bach's "Komm, süßer Tod" ("Come, Sweet Death") over and over at the piano. He also went for long swims in the Pacific Ocean, far from the shoreline.
"You reach a kind of euphoric state," Schwartz said in an interview. "You're in the ocean and you're euphoric because of the natural beauty, but also because you're on the cusp of extreme danger."
As Schwartz swam, he thought about musical ideas: an unusual chord progression in the Bach piece; glissandos, the sliding from one note to another; and an aural illusion known as the Shepard tone, the sonic equivalent of a barber's pole.
"I started to superimpose those things in an intuitive way, not thinking it was a concept," Schwartz said. "It just happened while in the ocean."
By June 2020, Schwartz had finished a new piece for orchestra based on those ideas. He called it "Theta," after the Greek letter once used as a symbol for death.
No one had commissioned the work. But a week after it was completed, Schwartz received a call from the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra. Its music director, Teodor Currentzis, was planning a program built around Gustav Mahler's final, incomplete Symphony No. 10, and wanted Schwartz to compose a piece.
Schwartz considered writing something new. But, as he researched the end of Mahler's life, Schwartz realized that the symphony and "Theta" had both been inspired by Bach works related to death. The pieces also shared an interest in mortality's release: As he composed, Mahler wrote in a poem to his wife, Alma, that he hoped for "the bliss of death in the most painful hours."
On Thursday, Currentzis and the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra will premiere "Theta" and other responses to Mahler's Symphony No. 10 in Stuttgart, followed by performances in Hamburg, Freiburg and Berlin. The concerts are a milestone for Schwartz, 58, an artist with no formal composition training who has forged a career largely parallel to the structures of contemporary classical music in Germany.
Despite -- or, as Schwartz sees it, because of -- his lack of academic education, his music is unmistakable. All his pieces include glissandos, which he uses to create arresting parabolas of texture. "There is no glissando without dissonance," Currentzis said in an interview. "Always he puts a note that keeps, and then the glissando creates the nirvana of the dissonance, of falling apart." At key moments, these tendrils of sound alight on major and minor chords: familiar harmonies rendered new.
Schwartz's pieces have clearly audible forms and stark climaxes, taking obvious pleasure in sound. "Musical events happen that achieve a kind of breathing or wave-shaped forms," Bernd Feuchtner, a writer and the artistic director of the Handel Festival in Halle, Germany, said in a phone interview. He added that when he hears a new Schwartz piece, "I'm always sitting on the edge of my seat."
The conductor Matthias Pintscher has said of Schwartz, "For me, he's a Schubert of our time."
SCHWARTZ'S FATHER was a boxer turned pool maintenance worker; his mother, a homemaker who later worked as a schoolteacher. Schwartz, who was born in San Diego, showed musical talent early: At 4, he would pick out snatches of the easy listening music his parents liked on his plastic toy piano. At 7, he began formal lessons.
His parents divorced in 1979, and his mother moved Schwartz and his two brothers to Deming, N.M., whose desert landscape he loved. He began practicing to become a classical pianist. Schwartz studied music at Arizona State University, where he won his first and only piano competition.
"I was taught that that was the thing I should be doing: playing Rachmaninoff concerti, and not making them up myself," Schwartz said. "I actually did play a Rachmaninoff concerto with the college orchestra. And at the end it was like, 'Did that, got the T-shirt. I'm out of here."'
In 1989, Schwartz traveled to the university town of Tübingen, Germany, for what was supposed to be a one-year exchange program as part of his graduate school studies in Arizona. He has lived in Germany ever since.
Schwartz considered studying musicology, but a professor, citing his then-rudimentary German, discouraged him. Instead, Schwartz practiced the language and worked on the assembly line of a Mercedes-Benz factory. "I was either listening to German grammar or to music, because the job was super boring," he said. "You could sit there for hours and not have a single part come by." (He now speaks German so fluently he sometimes needs a moment to find an English word.)
In 1990, Schwartz became an assistant in the musical archives of the Stuttgart State Theater, where he did what he described as "menial tasks." Later, the theater noticed his composition skill, and hired him to write small pieces of incidental music. The job wasn't for him. "I don't like being subordinate to some director saying, 'I need four bars of minor' and those kinds of ridiculous demands," Schwartz said.
But he did take advantage of free tickets to everything at the theater. He saw opera, ballet or theater nearly every night, and listened to contemporary music on public radio. He made some of his closest friends in those years. Still, it was a time of soul-searching. "An identity crisis comes with entering a foreign country," Schwartz said. "And that whole identity crisis is super important for forming an artist. I had years when I couldn't compose. When it did happen, it was a flood."
His catalog includes 16 pieces of chamber music, five vocal works, an opera, a recent recomposition of Schubert's "Winterreise" for voice and saxophone ensemble, a piece for voices and orchestra, and eight pieces in the series "Music for Orchestra," of which "Theta" is the most recent.
Schwartz began the "Music for Orchestra" series in 2002, when a cellist friend asked him to write a piece for 12 of his students and a semiprofessional string quintet, "Music for 17 String Instruments." A year later, the artistic director of the German National Theater in Weimar commissioned him to compose incidental music for a stage adaptation of Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther," with a full orchestra at Schwartz's disposal.
"He wanted me to copy Tchaikovsky, which I did," Schwartz said. "At the same time, I looked at the recording plan, and I had a ridiculous amount of time in the recording studio." He took the opportunity to orchestrate "Music for 17 String Instruments" and record it.
"I put it on their stands, and they did it, like, 'This is part of the play,"' Schwartz said. "It never entered the play."
That work became the first "Music for Orchestra." In a phone interview, Eric Marinitsch, the former head of promotion for Universal Edition, Schwartz's publisher, described hearing the music as a "big bang."
"The piece was so clear in its dramaturgy," Marinitsch said, "and yet composed with such complex means."
Composed over the past two decades, the pieces of "Music for Orchestra" evoke the austere, ominous beauty and subtle gradations of the environments where Schwartz was raised: the ocean and the desert. "The best art, at least that I've done, I don't feel like I'm inventing it," he said. "I find it, in the sense of excavating, going into something, and digging something up."
In late November, Schwartz traveled from Cologne, where he lives with his husband, to rehearsals for "Theta." In an early rehearsal, Schwartz and Currentzis worked to make the individual parts coalesce into a unified texture. "I hear fragments," Currentzis told the timpanist as he tried to smooth out a long, slow glissando.
Working together with visible joy, the conductor and the composer added Mahlerian touches -- winds playing with their bells up, a dramatic hammer stroke -- to the piece. They sang bits of "Komm, süßer Tod" to demonstrate musical shapes.
In a section of frothy trills, Schwartz addressed the woodwinds. "Realize," he told them, "that you're part of the wave."

Full text: Rahul Chatterjee had a special surprise for Christie Houlihan on their first date in June 2022, one that left her in tears.
Shortly after matching on the dating app Bumble, followed by a 90-minute "screening" phone call in June 2022, Christie Lynn Houlihan and Rahul Dev Chatterjee had their first date in Houston.
Ms. Houlihan, 40 and never married, told Mr. Chatterjee, 48, who was divorced for about a year at the time, that she had recently relocated to Dallas from New York City for work. She grew up in Bronxville, N.Y., in a family that valued music and the arts.
And so Mr. Chatterjee, born and raised in India and living in Texas since 2000 to study at Texas A&M University, arranged for them to meet in the bar area of Truluck's, a steakhouse with a piano player. Ms. Houlihan was visiting Houston on business as a consultant for EY Private, advising clients on wealth planning and business management.
"Our first date was fantastic," said Ms. Houlihan, who has a law degree from Fordham. She also has a bachelor's degree in social policy from Northwestern. "We talked about what we wanted in a life partner, our love for travel and music," she said, "and with my being Irish and Rahul Indian, we agreed family is important."
Mr. Chatterjee, an independent consultant specializing in inventory planning and supply chain, said he "thought she was beautiful, and in the light from the menu she looked like an angel." He has a master's degree in industrial engineering from Texas A&M, and a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Motilal Nehru Institute of Technology in Prayagraj, India.
When Ms. Houlihan mentioned she had prearranged an Uber to fetch her at 9 p.m., Mr. Chatterjee slid a small box across the table. After opening it, she froze with goose bumps and started to cry. Inside was a bottle of Shalimar perfume by Guerlain.
"My late grandmother, who was very important to me, wore Shalimar daily, and had given me bottles when I was young," she said. "Rahul had no way of knowing my deep emotional connection to this perfume."
When she was notified on her phone that her Uber had arrived, Mr. Chatterjee was disappointed. "I feared the whole date was a disaster when she ran off like Cinderella," he said.

But Ms. Houlihan had previously said that she would be making regular business trips to Houston, and so they met up the next week. They strolled around Rice University and dined at a neighborhood restaurant. The two bonded over their love for golden retrievers, their regular interaction with nieces and nephews, and the dream that someday they would have a family of their own.
"Our first kiss was magical," Mr. Chatterjee said. "We truly had a transformative evening where we each opened up emotionally."
The couple dated nearly every weekday she was in Houston, and on weekends met up in Dallas or Houston. They took several vacations together, including trips to Japan and Morocco.
But what sealed the deal for Ms. Houlihan was Mr. Chatterjee's offer to take care of her after she had knee cartilage surgery in October 2022. "He gave me a solid, secure and safe relationship which I never thought possible," she said.
In December 2022, they flew to India so Ms. Houlihan could meet Mr. Chatterjee's family. His mother greeted them at the airport in Kolkata, West Bengal, with flowers, tears and hugs. "The love and passion I feel for Christie I have never known in a romantic relationship," Mr. Chatterjee said. "I am consumed with gratitude to have found a person who genuinely cares about others and shares my belief in open communication."
On New Year's Day, at the Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur, Mr. Chatterjee dropped to one knee and asked her to be his "life partner."
"I said 'I love you' before answering 'yes,"' she said.
The couple married Nov. 18 at the Henry Morrison Flagler Museum in Palm Beach, Fla., the resort town where Ms. Houlihan had visited often her grandparents. Dale Walker, an elder at the Reformed Church of Bronxville, N.Y., who was ordained by the Universal Life Church, officiated in front of 165 guests.
The ceremony began with an Indian baraat, or groom's procession. Mr. Chatterjee, wearing a white tuxedo jacket, rode to the museum on the back of a 1962 red Mercedes-Benz. He was followed by an Irish bagpiper. And as a prelude, the Irish violinist Gregory Harrington, accompanied by two cellists, performed a medley of songs.
Ms. Houlihan, wore a Elie Saab off-white tulle ball gown and had paisley and floral henna designs applied on her hands. Under the mandap, or altar, she participated in the sindoor daan, where the groom placed a dash of vermilion powder on her hair partition, signifying the beginning of a new life.
"My heart felt solace after finding you," Ms. Houlihan said, reciting a portion of her vow in Bengali. She continued in English, "The only regret I will ever have about our relationship is that I wish I had met you sooner so I could have loved you longer."
In his vows, Mr. Chatterjee promised "faithfulness and patience, many memorable experiences, my sincere efforts to understand you better, and a lifetime of learning."

The Last Thread for George Santos? Luxury.: [National Desk]

Full text: Lying is one thing in politics. But lying and stealing for the sake of Ferragamo and Hermès?
In the end, it may have been the luxury goods that brought down George Santos.
Not the lies about going to Baruch College and being a volleyball star or working for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Not the claims of being Jewish and having grandparents who were killed in the Holocaust and a mother who died of cancer as result of 9/11. (Not true, it turned out.) Not the fibs about having founded an animal charity or owning substantial real estate assets. None of the falsehoods that have been exposed since Mr. Santos's election last year. After all, he did survive two previous votes by his peers to expel him from Congress, one back in May, one earlier in November.
At this point, the discussion around lies and politics is so familiar, it has become almost background noise.
But taking $ 6,000 of his campaign contributions and spending it on personal shopping at Ferragamo? Dropping another couple thousand at Hermès? At Sephora? On Botox?
Those revelations, documented in the House Ethics Committee report released Nov. 16, seemed simply too much. Despite the fact that Mr. Santos had announced that he would not seek re-election, despite the fact that he is still facing a 23-count federal indictment, Representative Michael Guest, the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, introduced a resolution the week before Thanksgiving calling for Mr. Santos's expulsion from Congress. On Friday, the House voted in favor -- 311 to 114, with two voting present -- making Mr. Santos only the third representative since the Civil War to be ejected from that legislative body.
As Michael Blake, a professor of philosophy, public policy and governance at the University of Washington, wrote in The Conversation, Mr. Santos's lies provoked "resentment and outrage, which suggests that they are somehow unlike the usual forms of deceptive practice undertaken during political campaigns."
It was in part the ties that had done it. The vanity. The unabashed display of greed contained in the silken self-indulgence of a luxury good.
"Material objects are at the heart of this thing," said Sean Wilentz, a professor of American history at Princeton University. "They expose what is seen as a universal character flaw and make it concrete."
White collar crime is often abstract and confusing. Tax evasion is not sexy. (Nothing about taxes is sexy.) It may get prosecutors excited, but the general public finds it boring. To be sure, the House Ethics Committee report, all 55 pages of it, went far beyond the juicy details of designer goods (not to mention an OnlyFans expense), but it is those details that have been plastered across the headlines and stick in the imagination. They make the narrative of wrongdoing personal, because one thing almost everyone can relate to is luxury goods.
These days they are everywhere: unboxed on TikTok with all the seductive allure of a striptease; dangling by celebrities on Instagram; glittering from store windows for the holidays. Lusted after and dismissed in equal measure for what they reveal about our own base desires and human weaknesses, they are representative of aspiration, achievement, elitism, wealth, indulgence, escapism, desire, envy, frivolity. Also the growing and extreme wealth gap and the traditions of royalty and dictators -- the very people the settlers (not to mention the Puritans) came to America to oppose.
There's a reason even Richard Nixon boasted in a 1952 speech that his wife, Pat, didn't "have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat."
As Mr. Wilentz said, it has been, and still is, "unseemly to appear too rich in Washington." (At least for anyone not named Trump. In this, as in so many things, the former president appears to be an exception to the rule.)
In the myth of the country -- the story America tells itself about itself -- our elected officials, above all, are not supposed to care about the trappings of wealth; they are supposed to care about the health of the country. "The notion of elected officials being public servants may be a polite fiction, but it is a polite fiction we expect politicians to maintain," Mr. Blake said.
Even if, as David Axelrod, the former Democratic strategist and senior fellow at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, points out, speaking of the amount of money needed to run for office these days, "office holders and candidates spend an awful lot of time rubbing shoulders with people of celebrity and wealth and often grow a taste for those lifestyles -- the material things; the private planes and lavish vacations."
Indeed, Mr. Santos is simply the latest elected official whose filching of funds to finance a posh lifestyle brought them to an ignominious end.
In 2014, for example, a former governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, was found guilty on federal bribery charges of accepting $ 175,000 worth of cash and gifts, including a Rolex watch and Louis Vuitton handbags and Oscar de la Renta gowns for his wife from the businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., and sentenced to two years in prison. (The Supreme Court later vacated the sentence.) During the trial, the products were entered as exhibits by the prosecution -- glossy stains on the soul of the electorate.
In 2018, Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, was convicted on eight counts of bank fraud and tax crimes after a Justice Department investigation revealed that he had spent $ 1.3 million on clothes, mostly at the House of Bijan in Beverly Hills, including a $ 15,000 ostrich jacket that set the social media world alight with scorn. More recently, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey was accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, among other bribes, in return for political favors.
In each case, while the financial chicanery was bad, it was the details of the stuff -- the objects themselves -- that became the smoking gun, the indefensible revelation of moral weakness. And so it was with Mr. Santos.
Even if, at one point, his appreciation of a good look may have made him seem more accessible -- he reviewed NASA's spacesuit and created a best- and worst-dressed list for the White House Correspondent's dinner, both on X -- it also proved his undoing. As the House Ethics Committee report read: "He blatantly stole from his campaign. He deceived donors into providing what they thought were contributions to his campaign but were in fact payments for his personal benefit."
And worse -- for vanity, reeking of ostentation. That's not just an alleged crime. It's an affront to democracy.

U.S. to Limit China's Role In E.V. Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Biden administration issued new rules to prevent Chinese firms from supplying parts for electric cars set to receive billions of dollars in tax credits.
The Biden administration proposed new rules on Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China.
The rules are meant to limit the role that firms in China can play in supplying materials for electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. They will also discourage companies that seek federal funding to build battery factories in the United States from sourcing materials from China or Russia.
The rules could encourage shifts in automotive supply chains, which continue to rely heavily on China for materials and components of electric vehicles. Automakers are also facing intense cost pressures as they try to modify their factories to make electric cars, and China offers some of the most advanced and lowest-priced battery technology in the world.
The Biden administration is trying to use billions of dollars in new federal funding to change that dynamic and create a U.S. supply chain for electric vehicles.
The climate law that President Biden signed in 2022 includes up to $ 7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy electric vehicles made in the United States using largely domestic materials. The law also included a general ban on Chinese products. Lawmakers mandated that firms in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran be prohibited from providing certain materials to cars that received those tax breaks.
But the law left open several questions, including what constitutes a Chinese or Russian company. Administration officials said those definitions included any entity that was incorporated or had headquarters in China or Russia, as well as any firm in which 25 percent of the board seats or equity interest was held by Chinese or Russian governments.
Chinese companies that set up operations outside China appear to be able to benefit from the rules as long as the Chinese government is not a significant shareholder. That provision came as a relief to some automakers, which feared that the Biden administration might bar them from contracting with Chinese-owned mines or factories in the United States or other parts of the world.
The law also requires battery makers that strike contracts or licensing agreements with Chinese firms to ensure that they are retaining certain rights over their projects. That provision is intended to make sure a Chinese firm is not effectively in control of such a project.
Some conservative lawmakers had challenged Ford Motor's plans to license technology from the Chinese battery giant known as CATL for a plant in Marshall, Mich., arguing that such a partnership should not be eligible for federal tax credits.
Some Republican lawmakers suggested on Friday that the Treasury Department's guidance did not go far enough to lessen the country's dependence on China.
"At a time when China is using massive subsidies to undercut U.S. manufacturers and throttle the global market for battery components, Treasury's naïve new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses," said Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The rules kick in for battery components in 2024, and in 2025 for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. They could be adjusted depending on industry comment.
The rules could have a profound impact on the U.S. electric vehicle market, which is rapidly growing -- battery-powered vehicles made up about 8 percent of new cars sold in the third quarter. Car and battery makers said Friday that they were still reviewing the rules, and that it would take time to determine how many models would qualify for tax credits.
Tesla said on Friday that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the $ 7,500 credit starting in January. The Model Y sport utility vehicle also might not qualify for the full credit after Dec. 31, Tesla said. The Model Y and Model 3 are the top two electric vehicles by sales in the United States. Tesla buys some batteries from CATL.
John Bozzella, the chief executive of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post Friday that the rules struck "a pragmatic balance," including by exempting trace materials. If the administration had banned all minor Chinese parts from the supply chain, no car models might have qualified for tax credits next year, he said.
Many cars have already been disqualified from purchase credits by other rules, like a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. Only about 20 vehicles currently qualify for the program out of more than 100 electric vehicles sold in the United States.
The rules also raised new questions about whether stricter requirements for supply chains could continue a trend of driving more shoppers to lease, rather than buy, vehicles.
The prohibition on sourcing from China applies only to vehicles that are sold, not to those that are leased. Consumers can receive tax credits for electric vehicles they lease from auto dealers, and that has led to a boom in E.V. leasing.
Jack Fitzgerald, chairman of Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which operates dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said he had seen a spike in customers leasing electric vehicles. But he said concern about electric vehicle range and the availability of chargers, more than price, was holding back electric vehicle sales.
"That's the principal thing," Mr. Fitzgerald said.
Auto industry lobbyists have warned that extremely strict rules could stifle electric vehicle sales, and they have urged the administration to strike more trade deals to secure supplies of scarce battery minerals. But Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said the company had structured its electric vehicle operations to be successful regardless of the federal rules.
"We're not anchoring the business on saying this has to happen" with regard to regulations, Mr. Jacobson told reporters on Thursday. If regulations change, he added, "it's not a backbreaking thing for us."
While the rules may create headaches for automakers, they are likely to benefit companies planning to supply batteries from factories in the United States.
"It's actually good news for us," said Siyu Huang, chief executive of Factorial, a Massachusetts company that is developing next-generation electric vehicle batteries with support from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, the owner of Dodge, Jeep and Ram.
Acquiring large amounts of lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, could be difficult because most of the metal is processed in China, Ms. Huang said. But the rules will encourage investment in U.S.-based refineries, she continued. "Its definitely going to be another incentive to build more domestic supply," Ms. Huang said.
John DeMaio, chief executive of Graphex Technologies, which is building a factory in Michigan to process graphite for batteries, said the rules might temporarily slow electric vehicle sales by making it harder to qualify for the tax credit. But in the long run, he added, they will encourage investment in domestic suppliers.
"It might be a hiccup," he said, "but in general it provides certainty and clarity to get people off the fence."
Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department, said in a briefing with reporters that the rules would help advance the administration's goals of building up an American clean energy supply chain while also cutting emissions in the transportation sector.
"These changes take time, but companies are making the investments and Americans are buying these cars," he said.
Over the past year, companies have invested $ 213 billion in the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, building electrification and carbon management technology in the United States, according to tracking by the Rhodium Group and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That is a 37 percent increase from a year earlier.
.
Still, the global electric vehicle industry remains heavily anchored in China, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of electric vehicles. China produces about two-thirds of the world's battery cells, and refines most of the minerals that are key to powering an electric vehicle.
The rules also restrict automakers from sourcing nickel used in their batteries from Russia, which is one of the world's largest nickel producers.
One of the challenges for automakers will be developing systems to track all the components of their battery through a long, and often opaque, supply chain.
Vehicles that are reported incorrectly will be subtracted from an automaker's eligibility for tax credits, Treasury said, and automakers that commit fraud or intentionally disregard the rules could be declared ineligible for the credit in the future.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration proposed new rules Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China.
The rules are meant to limit the role that Chinese firms can play in supplying materials for electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. They will also discourage companies that seek federal funding to build battery factories in the United States from sourcing materials from China or Russia.
The rules could encourage shifts in automotive supply chains, which continue to rely heavily on China for materials and components of electric vehicles. Automakers are also facing intense cost pressures as they try to modify their factories to make electric cars; China offers some of the most advanced and lowest-priced battery technology in the world.
The Biden administration is trying to use billions of dollars in new federal funding to change that dynamic and create a U.S. supply chain for electric vehicles.
The climate law President Joe Biden signed in 2022 includes up to $7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy electric vehicles made in the United States, using largely domestic materials. The law also included a general ban on Chinese products. Lawmakers mandated that firms in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran be prohibited from providing certain materials to cars that received those tax breaks.
But the law left open several questions, including what constitutes a Chinese or Russian company. Administration officials said those definitions included any entity that was incorporated or had headquarters in China or Russia, as well as any firm in which 25% of the board seats or equity interest was held by Chinese or Russian governments.
Chinese companies that set up operations outside China appear to be able to benefit from the rules, as long as the Chinese government is not a significant shareholder. That provision came as a relief to automakers, which feared that the Biden administration might ban them from contracting with Chinese-owned mines or factories in the United States or other parts of the world.
The law also requires battery makers that strike contracts or licensing agreements with Chinese firms to ensure that they are retaining certain rights over their projects. That provision is intended to make sure a Chinese firm is not effectively in control of such a project.
Some conservative lawmakers had challenged Ford Motor Co.’s plans to license technology from the Chinese battery giant known as CATL for a plant in Marshall, Michigan, arguing that such a partnership should not be eligible for federal tax credits.
Some Republican lawmakers suggested Friday that the Treasury Department’s guidance did not go far enough to lessen the country’s dependence on China.
“At a time when China is using massive subsidies to undercut U.S. manufacturers and throttle the global market for battery components, Treasury’s naive new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The rules kick in for battery components in 2024 and in 2025 for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. They could be adjusted depending on industry comment.
The rules could have a profound effect on the U.S. electric vehicle market, which is rapidly growing; battery-powered vehicles made up about 8% of new cars sold in the third quarter. Car and battery makers said Friday that they were still reviewing the rules and that it would take time to determine how many models would qualify for tax credits.
Tesla said Friday that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the $7,500 credit starting in January. The Model Y SUV also might not qualify for the full credit after Dec. 31, Tesla said. The Model Y and Model 3 are the top two electric vehicles by sales in the United States. Tesla buys some batteries from CATL.
John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post Friday that the rules struck “a pragmatic balance,” including by exempting trace materials. If the administration had banned all minor Chinese parts from the supply chain, no car models might have qualified for tax credits next year, he said.
Many cars have already been disqualified from purchase credits by other rules, like a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. Only about 20 vehicles currently qualify for the program out of more than 100 electric vehicles sold in the United States.
The rules also raised new questions about whether stricter requirements for supply chains could continue a trend of driving more shoppers to lease, rather than buy, vehicles.
The prohibition on sourcing from China applies only to vehicles that are sold, not to those that are leased. Consumers can receive tax credits for electric vehicles they lease from auto dealers, and that has led to a boom in EV leasing.
Jack Fitzgerald, chair of Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which operates dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said he had seen a spike in customers leasing electric vehicles. But he said concern about electric vehicle range and the availability of chargers, more than price, was holding back electric vehicle sales.
“That’s the principal thing,” Fitzgerald said.
Auto industry lobbyists have warned that extremely strict rules could stifle electric vehicle sales, and they have urged the administration to strike more trade deals to secure supplies of scarce battery minerals. But Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer of General Motors, said the company had structured its electric vehicle operations to be successful regardless of the federal rules.

Pickup or Lunar Lander? Tesla's Cybertruck Arrives.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two years behind schedule, the electric model has an unusual design that sets it apart from rival pickups, which could limit its sales.
Tesla began delivering its much delayed, highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup to customers on Thursday, entering one of the most lucrative but competitive segments of the auto industry.
With its stainless steel body and sharp angles, the Cybertruck is unlike pickups from Ford Motor, General Motors and Ram, which dominate the market. With a starting price of $ 100,000 for the top-of-the-line version, it is Tesla's first completely new passenger vehicle in more than three years but arrives long after other automakers began selling battery-powered pickups.
That has analysts asking just who will buy the Cybertruck. Will it steal customers from traditional automakers, appeal to a different crowd or become a costly flop? Tesla has said hundreds of thousands of people have placed $ 100 refundable deposits on Cybertrucks. But there is no guarantee those reservations will translate into sales.
"It does beg the question, what kind of customer is Tesla looking for?" said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, a firm that tracks electric vehicle and technology companies, who expects Tesla shares to outperform the market. "It looks like something lowered from the lunar module to collect rocks on the moon."
During an event Thursday in Austin, Texas, where the truck will be built, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, answered criticism that it was not a serious working vehicle. Videos showed the Cybertruck beating trucks from Ford and Rivian in a hauling contest, and being used to carry steel and pull machinery at a construction site.
"It's an incredibly useful truck. It's not just some grandstanding showpiece," Mr. Musk said, adding, "like me."
The quip was perhaps a reference to the firestorm he ignited Wednesday when he said that advertisers that have pulled advertising from X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter and which he owns, were attempting to "blackmail" him because he endorsed an antisemitic post. "Don't advertise," Mr. Musk said at the DealBook Summit in New York, addressing the brands. He used an expletive multiple times for emphasis.
First displayed publicly in 2019, the Cybertruck has suffered from production problems stemming from its odd design and the choice of stainless steel rather than the lighter steel or aluminum typically used in cars and trucks. Sales have been delayed by more than two years, and Mr. Musk has warned investors that the company may not be able to manufacture the truck in large numbers until 2025.
"There will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash-flow positive," Mr. Musk said in October.
There is a lot at stake for the traditional carmakers, too. Americans buy 2.5 million pickups a year, and those sales are an important source of profits for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, which owns Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. In the United States, pickups are often sold as luxury vehicles. Well-heeled Europeans or Asians tend to buy sedans and sport utility vehicles from Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Audi. Many affluent Americans buy Ford F-150s with 18-speaker sound systems and heated steering wheels.
Tesla said on its website that a two-wheel-drive version of the Cybertruck will sell for $ 61,000, but not be available until 2025. Versions that start at $ 80,000 and $ 100,000 will be available next year.
The first buyers are likely to be well-to-do technology savants and collectors, Mr. Rose said. The Cybertruck is unlikely to have as much appeal to corporate fleet operators like utilities or construction companies. Nor is the model likely to be affordable or practical for landscapers, drywall installers and other small-business owners.
That is a relief to the traditional carmakers. About one-fifth of the F-150s that Ford sells go to business or government customers. Ford's Pro division, which focuses on commercial customers, makes a lot more money as a percentage of its sales than the division that sells gasoline vehicles to individuals. (The division that sells electric vehicles to consumers lost money.)
Some businesses buy pickup trucks without cargo beds, instead installing specialized boxes or platforms suited to their needs. That will be impossible with the Cybertruck's one-piece body.
Even when businesses buy trucks with standard beds, they often add accessories like tool boxes or ladder racks that would not fit in the Cybertruck. (Most pickups from other manufacturers look and operate much the same so they can accommodate these add-ons.)
So far, sales of electric pickups and other vehicles to commercial customers have been modest. But Ford sees potential to dominate a fast-growing market where there won't be much competition from Tesla. Ford's E-Transit electric vans have 50 percent of their market in the United States and Europe, Ted Cannis, chief executive of Ford Pro, said in an interview. The electric version of the F-150, known as the Lightning, has almost no competition among commercial customers, he added.
Ford can earn additional revenue from business and government customers by selling them services like software that tracks the locations of their employees and creates efficient routes. Ford will also help customers set up charging stations for fleets of pickups and vans. "We have to make the transition as easy as possible," Mr. Cannis said.
There has been no indication that Tesla plans to provide similar services.
Marketing for the Cybertruck emphasizes its speed, comfort and toughness. Like Ford's F-150 Lightning, the Tesla pickup will come with power outlets for tools or appliances and can power a home temporarily during a blackout.
During the event Thursday, a video showed a man shooting bullets at a Cybertruck. "The apocalypse could come along at any moment," Mr. Musk quipped. "Here at Tesla we have the finest in apocalyptic technology."
Electric pickups have been available since late 2021, when Rivian, a young electric vehicle company, began selling the R1T. Ford began selling the F-150 Lightning in 2022. G.M. began selling an electric version of its Silverado pickup in limited numbers this year.
So far, the response from buyers has been mixed. Electric pickups accounted for only 3 percent of the electric vehicle market in the first nine months of 2023. And just 2 percent of all pickups sold in the United States were electric, according to estimates by Kelley Blue Book and Battle Road.
But sales are growing faster than the overall auto market even if the pace has slowed recently. F-150 Lightning sales in the first nine months of the year grew 40 percent to more than 12,000 vehicles, according to Kelley Blue Book. Sales of Rivian pickups grew 28 percent to more than 14,000 vehicles.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

Georgia Judge Modifies a Trump Co-Defendant's Bail Conditions: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prosecutors say the defendant, Harrison Floyd, has been intimidating potential witnesses in the racketeering case with his social media posts.
In a fiery courtroom presentation, the prosecutor overseeing the Georgia racketeering case against former President Donald J. Trump argued on Tuesday that one of Mr. Trump's co-defendants had intimidated potential witnesses on social media and should be sent to jail.
But Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court chose not to revoke the bond of Harrison Floyd, the co-defendant. Instead, he signed off on modified terms prohibiting Mr. Floyd from posting further comments about witnesses in the case.
Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., took the unusual step of personally arguing on behalf of the prosecution, a few days after she filed a motion accusing Mr. Floyd of intimidating an elections worker and other witnesses for the state -- including Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger -- through his posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Mr. Floyd's lawyers noted that Mr. Trump himself had issued provocative social media posts about the Georgia case, and that no action had been taken against him. That, they argued, made "the state's decision to go after Harrison Floyd hard to justify."
They also argued that Mr. Floyd had not been trying to intimidate or threaten anyone with his posts. But they acknowledged by the end of Tuesday's hearing that he had "walked up close to the line" of violating the terms of his bond.
Mr. Floyd, once the head of a group called Black Voices for Trump, was paid by the 2020 Trump campaign. He is one of 19 people, including the former president, who were named as defendants in a 98-page racketeering indictment in August.
The indictment charges them with orchestrating a "criminal enterprise" to reverse the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. Four of the defendants have pleaded guilty and have promised to cooperate with prosecutors.
In addition to a state racketeering charge, Mr. Floyd faces two other felony counts in the case, for his role in what the indictment describes as a scheme to intimidate Ruby Freeman, a Fulton County elections worker, and pressure her to falsely claim that she had committed electoral fraud.
Ms. Freeman and her daughter were part of a team processing votes in Fulton County on election night in November 2020. Soon after, video images of the two women handling ballots were posted online, and Trump supporters falsely claimed that the video showed them entering bogus votes to skew the election in President Biden's favor.
Ms. Freeman became the target of so many threats that she was forced to leave her home.
Her lawyer was a witness for the prosecution at Tuesday's hearing, producing a report that he said showed a recent "spike" in online mentions of Ms. Freeman. That spike led her to adopt a fresh set of security measures, her lawyer said.
Mr. Floyd's lawyers, John Morrison and Chris Kachouroff, called the effort to revoke his bond "a retaliatory measure" -- in part, they said, because Mr. Floyd recently turned down a plea agreement offered by the state.
They argued that "tagging" people in posts did not constitute contact with witnesses, and was no different from yelling "a message to someone else sitting on the opposite side of a packed Mercedes-Benz stadium during the middle of an Atlanta Falcons football game."
Ms. Willis responded that "this notion that tagging someone doesn't get a message to them is really lunacy," She also called Mr. Floyd's posts "disgusting," adding that "what he really did is spit on the court."
And she was explicit about the stakes as she saw them: Election workers, she said, should not be intimidated for doing their jobs.
Judge McAfee said that it appeared that Mr. Floyd had committed a "technical violation" of his bond by communicating with witnesses in the case, but seemed reluctant to take the step of jailing Mr. Floyd. "Not every violation compels revocation," he said.
Ms. Willis's forceful stance on Mr. Floyd's posts could have repercussions for Mr. Trump, who is enmeshed in battles over gag orders in other civil and criminal cases against him. Mr. Trump's bond agreement in Georgia specifies that he "shall perform no act," including social media posts, "to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice."
Mr. Floyd was the only one of the original 19 co-defendants in Georgia to spend days in jail in August while waiting to make bond. At Tuesday's hearing, he cut a colorful figure at the defense table, wearing a green blazer adorned with polo horses. Before the hearing began, he appeared to be reading a book about the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius.
As the two sides worked out the new terms of the bond agreement, Ms. Willis made a reference to "Trump," prompting Mr. Floyd to interject, "President Trump."
The judge told Mr. Floyd that it was not his place to talk.

F1 in Las Vegas: A Roaring Spectacle for Fans, but a Huge Headache for Locals

LAS VEGAS — Rajine Jones has a front-row seat to the Las Vegas Grand Prix, one of the most audacious events to roar into a city built on spectacle. Not that she will be able to see it.
On Saturday night, Formula One race cars will be hurtling down the Las Vegas Strip and buzzing past towering casinos, just outside the convenience store where Jones sells vape cartridges and energy drinks to tourists. But race organizers have shrouded the Strip in black tarp and fencing, and covered the glass on pedestrian walkways with white film and floodlights, obscuring the festivities from those without a $1,000 ticket.
“They blocked it,” Jones said, looking out her front doors at a line of tarp-covered fence. “We can’t see nothing.”
Race and county officials described the barriers and film as safety measures to protect the public and drivers. But to workers and small-business owners, it is the latest indignity of a monthslong construction project that has turned the Strip into a racetrack, while also causing huge headaches.
Race organizers and tourism officials have touted the Las Vegas Grand Prix as a sporting and economic success story years in the making — one that will infuse Las Vegas with celebrities, concerts and $1 billion in economic activity on a normally quiet pre-Thanksgiving weekend.
But local businesses and workers say they have been disproportionately forced to pay the price — in reduced profits, layoffs and exasperated hours stranded in traffic. They say that while the race may fill airports with private planes and penthouse suites with high-rollers, the losses suffered by everyday workers and small businesses are being overlooked.
“You can’t do this to a city,” said Wade Bohn, who runs Jay’s Market, a gas station and convenience store a few blocks off Las Vegas Boulevard, the formal name for the Strip.
He and other business owners say they have lost customers over the past six months as construction and road closures turned the Strip into a gridlocked labyrinth. Crews have repaved roads to accommodate F1 racers going 200 mph, built a pit area and erected temporary grandstands to accommodate 105,000 fans.
At Battista’s Hole in the Wall, an old-school Italian restaurant in the middle of the construction, revenue from each dinner shift has fallen by about $6,000 a night. The owner, Randy Markin, said he has stopped paying himself and can no longer afford to give his staff quarterly bonuses.
Hourly workers at casinos, hotels and restaurants also say they have been hit hard. Some servers and bartenders have lost thousands of dollars in tips because of a drop in customers. Some people’s commute times have tripled.
“They don’t pay me for the extra time,” said Carmen Gomez, who works nights sweeping the pedestrian bridges that span Las Vegas Boulevard. She said her 15-minute bus ride to work now takes an hour.
Jones, 28, who works at the convenience store facing Las Vegas Boulevard, said she has to navigate one set of road closures and one-lane traffic to take her 8-year-old son and 2-year-old twins to a 24-hour day care, and then fight through a second gantlet to get from day care to her job. Her half-hour commute is now 90 minutes each way.
At the cherry-red Jay’s Market, Bohn struggled on Thursday to contain his emotions as he surveyed the half-empty store. He blamed a temporary bridge on Flamingo Road that had been built to carry traffic over one section of the racecourse. It has funneled customers away from him entirely.
Normally, his gas station is packed with tourists from California filling up their tanks and grabbing sandwiches, but he said his revenue this year is down $2.2 million compared with 2022.
He has laid off seven of his 12 employees, and said he does not know whether his store will survive if the Grand Prix becomes an annual event in the heart of the Strip, as local leaders envision. He said he has sent several emails and called Clark County commissioners, who approved the race, but has not gotten any response. (Because the Strip and racecourse lie outside Las Vegas city limits, the event is overseen by the county).
Colleen Angel is one of the workers who was laid off from Bohn’s store. She had taken the job as a graveyard-shift cashier this year in the hope that it would be steady work after years of doing various gigs such as teaching singing, performing in a classic-rock band and doing retail work.
She said the tensions swirling around the Grand Prix had highlighted the disparate treatment received by major corporations and the thousands of workers who keep the roulette wheels spinning, pillows plumped, floors gleaming and drinks cold.
“It’s not just about bad traffic for a few months,” she said. “It’s the people who work on the Strip. The reason people come here from all over the world, the amenities — it takes a lot of backbreaking work to keep it in place.”
Fans and race organizers are calling the Grand Prix a triumphant return that brings F1 racing back to Las Vegas for the first time in 40 years. The race Saturday is the first in what is expected to be a decade of racing, and local officials say they want a “lifetime partnership” with F1 — part of a campaign to diversify the Strip with new sports stadiums and an otherworldly Magic 8 ball of an amphitheater called the Sphere.
County officials have said the race is expected to bring in $100 million in taxes and create at least 7,700 jobs.
“It has not all been sacrifice,” Jim Gibson, a county commissioner, told 8 News Now Las Vegas. Members of the county commission did not respond to interview requests, or declined to comment. Race organizers did not respond to a request for comment.
This fall, the commission sharply questioned race officials over their plans to help get thousands of casino employees to and from work. Some commissioners have also balked at a request from the Grand Prix for Clark County to chip in $40 million to help pay for road work done for the race.
One of the questions still looming like a cloud of exhaust over the race is whether it can draw enough people to fill 105,000 seats and generate all of the predicted economic returns for Las Vegas. On Friday, the day before the race, there were still tickets available for the three-day event, and ticket prices on resale websites were going for less than full price.
Still, as the race cars revved up for their first practice run Thursday night, the Strip was filled with thousands of excited fans from China, Mexico, Europe and across the United States, decked out in Ferrari T-shirts, Mercedes-Benz baseball caps and Red Bull racing jackets.
Some fans, including Jesus Nuñez, 31, who flew up from Mexico City with eight family members, could not afford tickets, so they perched along a railing outside a casino, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mexican driver Sergio Pérez through the black-screened fencing. “It’s exciting,” he said.
Zia Hasan, who bought passes as a birthday present for his 17-year-old son, Shayan, said it was thrilling to wander down Las Vegas Boulevard beside the racing lights.
“The tickets are pricey, but it’s once in a lifetime,” he said.
A different kind of Las Vegas Grand Prix, however, is taking place away from the track and lights.
Out there on the clogged streets, Tsegaw Ashine, 38, a taxi driver who moved to Las Vegas in 2016, said he would love to watch the Grand Prix, but instead will spend race weekend weaving through the orange barrels, avoiding angry drivers and trying to earn enough to get by despite the gridlock.
“Our business is our time,” he said. “We’ve got to try to pick up more people.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The flashy adult playground shrouds itself in black tarp to block views of the racing spectacle from prying (unticketed) eyes. Its transformation has become a long-term, costly nuisance for locals.
Rajine Jones has a front-row seat to the Las Vegas Grand Prix, one of the most audacious events to roar into a city built on spectacle. Not that she will be able to see it.
On Saturday night, Formula One racecars will be hurtling down the Las Vegas Strip and buzzing past towering casinos, just outside the convenience store where Ms. Jones sells vape cartridges and energy drinks to tourists. But race organizers have shrouded the Strip in black tarp and fencing, and covered the glass on pedestrian walkways with white film and floodlights, obscuring the festivities from those without a $ 1,000 ticket.
"They blocked it," Ms. Jones said, looking out her front doors at a line of tarp-covered fence. "We can't see nothing."
Race and county officials described the barriers and film as safety measures to protect the public and drivers. But to workers and small-business owners, it is the latest indignity of a monthslong construction project that has turned the Strip into a racetrack, while also causing huge headaches.
Race organizers and tourism officials have touted the Las Vegas Grand Prix as a sporting and economic success story years in the making -- one that will infuse Las Vegas with celebrities, concerts and $ 1 billion in economic activity on a normally quiet pre-Thanksgiving weekend.
But local businesses and workers say they have been disproportionately forced to pay the price -- in reduced profits, layoffs and exasperated hours stranded in traffic. They say that while the race may fill airports with private planes and penthouse suites with high-rollers, the losses suffered by everyday workers and small businesses are being overlooked.
"You can't do this to a city," said Wade Bohn, who runs Jay's Market, a gas station and convenience store a few blocks off Las Vegas Boulevard, the formal name for the Strip.
He and other business owners say they have lost customers over the past six months as construction and road closures turned the Strip into a gridlocked labyrinth. Crews have repaved roads to accommodate Formula One racers going 200 miles per hour, built a pit area and erected temporary grandstands to accommodate 105,000 fans.
At Battista's Hole in the Wall, an old-school Italian restaurant in the middle of the construction, revenue from each dinner shift has fallen by about $ 6,000 a night. The owner, Randy Markin, said he has stopped paying himself and can no longer afford to give his staff quarterly bonuses.
Hourly workers at casinos, hotels and restaurants also say they have been hit hard. Some waiters and bartenders have lost thousands of dollars in tips because of a drop in customers. Some people's commute times have tripled.
"They don't pay me for the extra time," said Carmen Gomez, who works nights sweeping the pedestrian bridges that span Las Vegas Boulevard. She said her 15-minute bus ride to work now takes an hour.
Ms. Jones, 28, who works at the convenience store facing Las Vegas Boulevard, said she has to navigate one set of road closures and one-lane traffic to take her 8-year-old son and 2-year-old twins to a 24-hour day care, and then fight through a second gantlet to get from day care to her job. Her half-hour commute is now 90 minutes each way.
At the cherry-red Jay's Market, Mr. Bohn struggled on Thursday to contain his emotions as he surveyed the half-empty store. He blamed a temporary bridge on Flamingo Road that had been built to carry traffic over one section of the racecourse. It has funneled customers away from him entirely.
Normally, his gas station is packed with tourists from California filling up their tanks and grabbing sandwiches, but he said his revenue this year is down $ 2.2 million compared with 2022.
He has laid off seven of his 12 employees, and said he does not know whether his store will survive if the Grand Prix becomes an annual event in the heart of the Strip, as local leaders envision. He said he has sent several emails and called the Clark County commissioners, who approved the race, but has not gotten any response. (Because the Strip and racecourse lie outside Las Vegas city limits, the event is overseen by the county).
Colleen Angel is one of the workers who was laid off from Mr. Bohn's store. She had taken the job as a graveyard-shift cashier earlier this year in the hope that it would be steady work after years of doing various gigs such as teaching singing, performing in a classic-rock band and doing retail work.
She said the tensions swirling around the Grand Prix had highlighted the disparate treatment received by major corporations and the thousands of workers who keep the roulette wheels spinning, pillows plumped, floors gleaming and drinks cold.
"It's not just about bad traffic for a few months," she said. "It's the people who work on the Strip. The reason people come here from all over the world, the amenities -- it takes a lot of backbreaking work to keep it in place."
Fans and race organizers are calling the Grand Prix a triumphant return that brings Formula 1 racing back to Las Vegas for the first time in 40 years. The race on Saturday is the first in what is expected to be a decade of racing, and local officials say they want a "lifetime partnership" with Formula 1 -- part of a campaign to diversify the Strip with new sports stadiums and an otherworldly Magic 8 ball of an amphitheater called the Sphere.
County officials have said the race is expected to bring in $ 100 million in taxes and create at least 7,700 jobs.
"It has not all been sacrifice," Jim Gibson, a county commissioner, told 8 News Now Las Vegas. Members of the county commission did not respond to interview requests, or declined to comment. Race organizers did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this fall, the commission sharply questioned race officials over their plans to help get thousands of casino employees to and from work. Some members of the commission have also balked at a request from the Grand Prix for Clark County to chip in $ 40 million to help pay for road work done for the race.
One of the questions still looming like a cloud of exhaust over the race is whether it can draw enough people to fill 105,000 seats and generate all of the predicted economic returns for Las Vegas. On Friday, the day before the race, there were still tickets available for the three-day event, and ticket prices on resale websites were going for less than full price.
Still, as the racecars revved up for their first practice run on Thursday night, the Strip was filled with thousands of excited fans from China, Mexico, Europe and across the United States, decked out in Ferrari T-shirts, Mercedes-Benz baseball caps and Red Bull racing jackets.
Some fans, like Jesus Nuñez, 31, who flew up from Mexico City with eight family members, could not afford tickets, so they perched along a railing outside a casino, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Mexican driver Sergio Pérez through the black-screened fencing. "It's exciting," he said.
Zia Hasan, who bought passes as a birthday present for his 17-year-old son, Shayan, said it was thrilling to wander down Las Vegas Boulevard beside the racing lights.
"The tickets are pricey, but it's once in a lifetime," he said.
A different kind of Las Vegas Grand Prix, however, is taking place away from the track and lights.
Out there on the clogged streets, Tsegaw Ashine, 38, a taxi driver who moved to Las Vegas in 2016, said he would love to watch the Grand Prix, but instead will spend race weekend weaving through the orange barrels, avoiding angry drivers and trying to earn enough to get by despite the gridlock.
"Our business is our time," he said. "We've got to try to pick up more people."

Ferrari Luxury Has Its Price: $51.7 Million for a '62 GTO: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A single-lot auction of a classic racing car that is considered the Holy Grail of Ferraris last changed hands in 1985 -- for a fraction of the price.
A bright red Ferrari with a storied history sold for $ 51.7 million, with buyer's fees, on Monday, becoming the most expensive automobile from that Italian carmaker ever sold at auction. The price nevertheless fell short of the auction house's expectations at a time when the once red-hot market for collectibles has begun to cool amid geopolitical uncertainty and rising interest rates.
RM Sotheby's, the automobile seller in which Sotheby's bought a controlling stake in 2022, offered the 1962 Ferrari 330 LM/250 GTO by Scaglietti with an unpublished estimate of $ 60 million. Two bidders drove the price to $ 47 million before auction-house fees. (RM Sotheby's declined to give any information about the buyer.)
Sotheby's promoted the car as a luxury object, offering it in a stand-alone sale during its marquee fall auctions of fine art in New York. To drive the point home, the auctioneer, Oliver Barker -- who is also chairman of Sotheby's Europe -- presided over the proceedings at Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters, where the car was parked in front of a painting by the contemporary art star Jonas Wood.
There are only 36 Ferrari 250 GTOs in existence, produced between 1962 and 1964. Owners of the car instantly become members of an exclusive club that includes the fashion designer Ralph Lauren and Nick Mason, the drummer for Pink Floyd.
RM Sotheby's described this particular car as "one of one." Although it looks almost identical to a 250 GTO, it was originally configured as a 330 LM, an even rarer car with a slightly larger engine. Converted into a 250 GTO later in 1962, it is the only one ever raced by Scuderia Ferrari, the carmaker's racing division. Ferrari sold it to a Sicilian surgeon in 1964 for $ 6,000.
The car, known as Chassis number 3765, failed to approach the current auction record for a classic car, which was set last year when RM Sotheby's sold a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe for €135 million, or about $ 144 million today. (A Ferrari 250 GTO was reported to have sold privately in 2016 for more than $ 70 million.)
The $ 51.7 million price is still a considerable markup from the roughly $ 500,000 it sold for when it last changed hands in 1985 -- or $ 1.4 million today -- according to Gord Duff, RM Sotheby's global head of auctions. An RM Sotheby's spokesman confirmed the seller was Jim Jaeger, an Ohio-based collector and co-founder of a radar detection business.
Simon Kidston, a Geneva-based classic car dealer, said that the Chassis number 3765's unique history may have hurt more than it helped. "It's a great car. I don't think, unfortunately, that everybody understands it," he said. "In a market where appearances are very important and people like the comfort of belonging to a group of like-minded owners, anything that needs explaining is always a little bit more of a challenge to sell."

Plan to Help Native Americans Get Sober Ended in a Nightmare: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Arizona spent $ 1 billion on addiction treatment, much of it fraudulent, officials said. Scores of Native Americans who sought help are still struggling with untreated addiction -- and some died in rehab.
The white vans were the first thing people noticed.
They began popping up around tribal reservations in the Southwest a few years ago, trolling through alleys and parking lots on a hunt for new business. They approached anyone who looked homeless or intoxicated with an alluring pitch: Get in, and we'll give you shelter, sobriety and a better life.
Monica Antonio, 21, was one of thousands of people who leaped at the chance. She had been desperate to stop drinking for her three young children, her family said. But the San Carlos Apache Reservation in rural eastern Arizona, where she lived, had limited resources for drug or alcohol treatment. So last January, a van whisked her 130 miles to one of hundreds of sober-living houses that have proliferated around Phoenix in recent years, with little oversight or control.
She did well at first, earning a 30-day sobriety certificate, but friends and family said they started to worry when Ms. Antonio posted online photos showing drinking and drug use inside her sober-living home. They said she started to slip.
"I told her, 'Monica, you're supposed to be sobering up, don't you have rules?"' said her grandmother, Vernadell Johnson. "She said no."
She had tumbled into what prosecutors and tribal leaders call one of the largest, most exploitative frauds in Arizona's history -- a scheme in which hundreds of rehab centers provided shoddy or nonexistent addiction treatment to thousands of vulnerable Native Americans that cost the state as much as $ 1 billion. Scores of people ended up homeless, still struggling with untreated addiction, officials say.
In the grimmest cases, tribal members died of overdoses inside the sober homes where they had sought help.
Navajo activists in Phoenix, who first alerted authorities more than a year ago to problems inside the sober-living homes, say they have tracked the deaths of at least 40 Native Americans who had been at these homes. Some died while they were still patients; some overdosed on buses or the streets after fleeing or getting kicked out. Others ended up homeless in Phoenix and died of heat exposure or were hit by cars.
"It's one of the greatest failures of Arizona government ever," said Attorney General Kris Mayes, who, along with Gov. Katie Hobbs, announced a crackdown against the treatment centers earlier this year.
Ms. Mayes said the treatment centers operated largely unchecked for years, taking advantage of gaps in an Arizona program that funds health care for low-income tribal members. The schemes exploited overlapping American woes -- addiction, soaring homelessness and a long history of disregard for Native American health.
Operators set up companies with names like Healing Fountain, Happy Valley or Angelic Behavioral Health, registered with the state as counseling centers and behavioral health residential facilities, and placed them in subdivisions where small-scale investors have snapped up homes as rental properties.
They began running up huge bills, Arizona authorities say. One business billed the state thousands, purportedly to treat a 4-year-old for alcohol addiction. Another charged $ 1.2 million to treat a parent and two young children for a year.
Similar frauds have occurred in Nevada, Georgia and Texas, Ms. Mayes said, though on a smaller scale.
The money Arizona paid out to these programs through its Medicaid system exploded over the past four years, from $ 53 million in 2019 to $ 668 million last year. Officials said they do not know how much of that was for legitimate treatment, and how much was fraud.
"It's scary that this is happening in the middle of America," said President Buu Nygren of the Navajo Nation, which declared a public health emergency over the fraud.
State officials said the Medicaid fund for Native American treatment amounted to a virtually unguarded pool of money that was poorly regulated and easily exploited. They have since tightened their rules and shut off the unlimited supply of money.
Reva Stewart, a Navajo activist working with families to find their relatives, said some fraudulent homes are still operating and people are still being recruited. "It's really frustrating," she said.
State officials say they are continuing to investigate.
Arizona has suspended more than 300 treatment businesses -- including the company that ran the home where Ms. Antonio stayed. It has charged more than 40 people with defrauding taxpayers by running up huge bills through Arizona's American Indian Health Program, which is part of its Medicaid system.
The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors are investigating. In July, a woman from Mesa., Ariz., became one of the first people convicted after she pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors say she was an owner of two treatment companies that received $ 22 million. According to court documents, she spent the money on four Mercedes-Benz cars, homes in Las Vegas and Arizona, diamond necklaces and a showroom's worth of Gucci, Versace and Louis Vuitton bags.
Tribal leaders and more than a dozen former patients said that the human toll of the scheme was far worse and larger than any financial loss.
People who traveled from as far as Montana and the Dakotas described Arizona's sober-living providers as slapdash operations where drugs and alcohol were plentiful, but actual help was scarce. Some homes were well kept while others were furnished only with mattresses and a few boxes of macaroni and cheese.
"It was so empty and depressing," said Cydney Smith, a San Carlos Apache member who lived in a residential facility last year. "The door was broken. No bed. People were coming in and doing drugs."
According to interviews with activists, former patients and Arizona officials, the small staffs who ran the homes made little effort to help people stay sober, and in some cases fostered their addiction. The white vans sometimes stopped at liquor stores on the way to Phoenix to ply people with alcohol.
Some homes conducted regular drug tests and had zero tolerance. Others looked the other way while people smoked meth and drank in their bedrooms, former residents said.
"There were fights, there were drugs, there was alcohol in these homes," said State Senator Theresa Hatathlie, a Navajo citizen who says she tried for years to get regulators to shut down the unlicensed sober-living houses. "There was no enforcement. The idea seems like: Let's keep them drunk, keep them using. The longer they stay, the more money."
It was a volume business, and the operators paid residents to recruit friends and family as new patients.
Several tribal members said they never spoke with any counselors or addiction experts. Instead, they were shuttled to group rehab sessions, where the only requirement was that they sign in and provide their tribal identification numbers so providers could start billing.
Often, patients decided to leave the homes or were evicted when the treatment centers abruptly shuttered. This left them on the street, stranded hundreds of miles from family with no money and no way to call home.
Joryan Polk, 22, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, had grown so despondent during his drug treatment program that he called his mother to say that no one was listening or helping, his mother said. He was found dead and face down in his bedroom last January after overdosing on meth and fentanyl. Residents at the home told a police officer that nobody had checked on Mr. Polk for about two days, according to a police report.
The facility where he had been receiving care, Empire Wellness, was suspended in July for billing issues, according to state officials. State officials have declined to provide details about the investigation into the business; the facility's owner did not answer questions about the investigation.
Daniel Fallah, the owner, said that he had tried to help Mr. Polk get off drugs and that his company regularly did drug screenings and did not allow its patients to use. He said there were staff members inside the home to monitor residents.
"Everybody's a grown-up," he said, in an interview before the business was suspended. "People make choices."
Police reports and autopsies chronicling several deaths have ruled them to be accidents, and state officials have not filed criminal charges relating to any deaths. Several families said they were desperate for answers or some accountability, but had not been able to find lawyers to file lawsuits or even reach the people behind the now-suspended companies that ran the treatment centers.
Friends and relatives of Ms. Antonio, the patient from the San Carlos Apache Reservation, said they were still trying to unravel what happened to her.
One night in late March, Ms. Antonio and a friend left her sober-living home and drank at a small park in a gated community in southwest Phoenix, according to a police report. She was left lying by the front door, where a staff member found Ms. Antonio on the ground holding a can of alcohol, the report said. The staff member let Ms. Antonio into the house, but did not call for medical help.
She was found dead on her mattress the next morning. An autopsy found she had died of alcohol poisoning. Tessie Dillon, one of Ms. Antonio's aunts, said the family rushed from the San Carlos reservation to Phoenix. She said the sober-living home reeked of alcohol, and that Ms. Antonio's bedroom had little else than a thin mattress and her clothes piled in the closet.
Ms. Dillon said Ms. Antonio's three children, who are now 8, 7 and 5 years old, still ask for their mother. She still has questions about why nobody checked on Ms. Antonio the night she died, why she was simply put to bed. Officials for the business, which was suspended by the state, did not respond to a request for comment.
An administrator from the treatment business did promise to pay Ms. Antonio's $ 5,000 funeral bill, Ms. Dillon said.
"We sent them the invoice," she said. "Nothing."

BYLAS, Ariz. — The white vans were the first thing people noticed.

Reva Stewart, a Navajo activist working with families to find their relatives, said some fraudulent homes are still operating and people are still being recruited. “It’s really frustrating,” she said.
State officials say they are continuing to investigate.
Arizona has suspended more than 300 treatment businesses — including the company that ran the home where Antonio stayed. It has charged more than 40 people with defrauding taxpayers by running up huge bills through Arizona’s American Indian Health Program, which is part of its Medicaid system.
The FBI and federal prosecutors are investigating. In July, a woman from Mesa, Arizona, became one of the first people convicted after she pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors say she was an owner of two treatment companies that received $22 million. According to court documents, she spent the money on four Mercedes-Benz cars, homes in Las Vegas and Arizona, diamond necklaces and a showroom’s worth of Gucci, Versace and Louis Vuitton bags.
Tribal leaders and more than a dozen former patients said that the human toll of the scheme was far worse and larger than any financial loss.
People who traveled from as far as Montana and the Dakotas described Arizona’s sober-living providers as slapdash operations where drugs and alcohol were plentiful, but actual help was scarce. Some homes were well kept while others were furnished only with mattresses and a few boxes of macaroni and cheese.
“It was so empty and depressing,” said Cydney Smith, a San Carlos Apache member who lived in a residential facility last year. “The door was broken. No bed. People were coming in and doing drugs.”
According to interviews with activists, former patients and Arizona officials, the small staffs who ran the homes made little effort to help people stay sober, and in some cases fostered their addiction. The white vans sometimes stopped at liquor stores on the way to Phoenix to ply people with alcohol.
Some homes conducted regular drug tests and had zero tolerance. Others looked the other way while people smoked meth and drank in their bedrooms, former residents said.
“There were fights, there were drugs, there was alcohol in these homes,” said state Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Navajo citizen who says she tried for years to get regulators to shut down the unlicensed sober-living houses. “There was no enforcement. The idea seems like: Let’s keep them drunk, keep them using. The longer they stay, the more money.”
It was a volume business, and the operators paid residents to recruit friends and family as new patients.
Several tribal members said they never spoke with any counselors or addiction experts. Instead, they were shuttled to group rehab sessions, where the only requirement was that they sign in and provide their tribal identification numbers so providers could start billing.
Often, patients decided to leave the homes or were evicted when the treatment centers abruptly shuttered. This left them on the street, stranded hundreds of miles from family with no money and no way to call home.
Joryan Polk, 22, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, had grown so despondent during his drug treatment program that he called his mother to say that no one was listening or helping, his mother said. He was found dead and facedown in his bedroom last January after overdosing on meth and fentanyl. Residents at the home told a police officer that nobody had checked on Polk for about two days, according to a police report.
The facility where he had been receiving care, Empire Wellness, was suspended in July for billing issues, according to state officials. State officials have declined to provide details about the investigation into the business; the facility’s owner did not answer questions about the investigation.
Daniel Fallah, the owner, said that he had tried to help Polk get off drugs and that his company regularly did drug screenings and did not allow its patients to use. He said there were staff members inside the home to monitor residents.
“Everybody’s a grown-up,” he said, in an interview before the business was suspended. “People make choices.”
Police reports and autopsies chronicling several deaths have ruled them to be accidents, and state officials have not filed criminal charges relating to any deaths. Several families said they were desperate for answers or some accountability, but had not been able to find lawyers to file lawsuits or even reach the people behind the now-suspended companies that ran the treatment centers.
Friends and relatives of Antonio, the patient from the San Carlos Apache Reservation, said they were still trying to unravel what happened to her.
One night in late March, Antonio and a friend left her sober-living home and drank at a small park in a gated community in southwest Phoenix, according to a police report. She was left lying by the front door, where a staff member found Antonio on the ground holding a can of alcohol, the report said. The staff member let Antonio into the house but did not call for medical help.
She was found dead on her mattress the next morning. An autopsy found she had died of alcohol poisoning. Tessie Dillon, one of Antonio’s aunts, said the family rushed from the San Carlos reservation to Phoenix. She said the sober-living home reeked of alcohol, and that Antonio’s bedroom had little else than a thin mattress and her clothes piled in the closet.
Dillon said Antonio’s three children, who are now 8, 7 and 5 years old, still ask for their mother. She still has questions about why nobody checked on Antonio the night she died, why she was simply put to bed. Officials for the business, which was suspended by the state, did not respond to a request for comment.
An administrator from the treatment business did promise to pay Antonio’s $5,000 funeral bill, Dillon said.
“We sent them the invoice,” she said. “Nothing.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden's signature climate law has stimulated a surge of investment in electric vehicle production across the country, including tens of billions of dollars on battery plants across the South and new assembly lines near the Great Lakes. Based on early evidence, it is succeeding at a goal that economists have long considered difficult and costly: using the power of government to rapidly grow a new industry.
That growth could prove crucial for the other side of the electric vehicle equation: enticing more consumers to buy them. That's because Mr. Biden's law effectively hitches the future affordability of electric vehicles to automakers' willingness to source and build them in the United States.
For now, the climate law has not drastically affected trends in electric vehicle sales. Americans are poised to buy one million electric cars and trucks for the first time this year, continuing a steady trend of increased market share for electric vehicles that began years ago.
The law's most pronounced immediate effect on the consumer market appears to be unintended: driving many electric car shoppers to lease vehicles instead of buying them. That's because a Treasury Department regulation enables auto dealers to avoid the law's made-in-America requirements for cars that they buy and then lease to customers. That allows shoppers to effectively reap the full benefits of the federal tax break for models that otherwise would not qualify.
Still, analysts say, electric vehicle sales are projected to jump sharply under the right conditions. Automakers would need to continue to invest in battery and assembly plants. Administration officials must speed the deployment of charging stations meant to ease the logistics of owning and driving an electric vehicle.
Mr. Biden is trying to jump-start the electric vehicle market as the global transition to cleaner fuels is accelerating more quickly than expected. That includes the switch to electric vehicles, which are a cornerstone of efforts to reduce emissions in the sector of the U.S. economy that emits the most greenhouse gases: transportation. Government policy missteps could slow or stall that growth.
The administration's policies to boost electric vehicles aren't just aimed at climate change. They also seek to support middle-class jobs for Americans in the auto industry. In a best-case scenario for the administration, those goals work together. The more automakers do to meet the made-in-America requirements in the climate law, the faster the electric vehicle industry will grow to dominate the U.S. auto market.
That relationship is primarily a function of cost. Without an American supply chain, electric vehicles can't qualify for the full $ 7,500 consumer tax credit the law created. Without the full credit, a typical electric vehicle remains less affordable than a conventional automobile. Those requirements don't apply to the leasing market, which explains the shift in consumer preferences.
"I think it's going to be a long time before you see your local waitress come in and buy an E.V. -- they're just too expensive," said Rhett Ricart, the chief executive and owner of the Ricart Automotive Group in Columbus, Ohio, and a former president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
"If we're going to get people to buy these electric vehicles in volume," he said, "we will need more financial assistance from the manufacturers or the government."
Tax credits spur U.S. investment
The climate law spurred investment at a pivotal moment for American automakers. After a prolonged strike, union autoworkers won new concessions for workers who assemble electric vehicles and produce batteries at some plants that the three largest American carmakers run.
Republican leaders and some Wall Street analysts are calling on carmakers to abandon their plans and refocus on gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. They claim the vehicle transition is effectively subsidizing China, which leads the world in electric-car technology and is home to vast stockpiles of critical minerals needed for batteries and other components.
The climate law's champions pitched it as a way to counter China and pull mining and manufacturing to the United States. That group included Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat who cast the decisive vote for the bill and wielded outsize influence on its every detail.
Under the law, companies get lucrative tax credits for investing in electric vehicle production and component parts like advanced batteries. Consumers get up to $ 7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. But at Mr. Manchin's insistence, vehicles qualify for the credit only if they meet certain standards for how much of their content is made and mined in America, or in certain allied countries. Those standards get stricter every year.
Lobbyists from American auto companies warned that those requirements were so stringent that most electric vehicles -- other than Teslas -- would not qualify. Even Tesla vehicles could soon be excluded.
To avoid losing out, automakers have announced new battery projects across the country, particularly near Detroit and through the Southeast. They include plans from foreign automakers like Hyundai that were immediately excluded from the credit but want buyers to have access to it in the future.
"The response has happened faster than I think anyone would have anticipated on the supply side in anticipation of demand increasing," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in an interview. "I think the reason you're seeing these investments is that, ultimately, these companies see that over time, these credits are going to be quite effective in getting consumers to make a decision."
One area where companies have been slower to invest in the United States is in the raw materials and parts needed for batteries, including mines producing minerals like cobalt, and factories making chemicals that go into batteries. In the coming weeks, the Biden administration is expected to issue more rules about when these parts can be sourced from China and other countries, which are likely to determine where many companies base new projects.
Another proposed Biden regulation, from the Environmental Protection Agency, is encouraging automakers' investment in electric vehicle production. It seeks to ensure that two-thirds of all new passenger cars sold in the United States will be all-electric within a decade.
A Treasury rule encourages leasing
There is little evidence that the climate law has supercharged consumer demand for electric vehicles. American consumers bought about 873,000 electric vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. That put the country on a pace to surpass one million electric vehicle sales this year for the first time, but electric vehicles still account for not even one in 10 new cars and trucks sold in the United States.
The pace of that E.V. sales growth is actually slowing: Through the first nine months of 2022, Kelley Blue Book estimated, sales were up nearly 70 percent from the same period in 2021.
The climate law "certainly helped" with electric vehicle sales, said Mike Stanton, the president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. But, he said, "we were hoping for more."
The law has had a mixed effect for consumers and automakers. The federal government previously offered credits to electric car buyers but capped the total that individual automakers could qualify for. Both Tesla and General Motors, the nation's largest sellers of electric vehicles, exceeded that cap, meaning some consumers could not claim a credit for buying their cars.
The climate law restored credits for several of both companies' electric vehicles. It also eliminated credits for many of their competitors, like Hyundai and Kia, that assemble electric cars abroad. As of April, the number of vehicle models that qualify for the full credit had fallen by half compared with how many qualified before the climate law passed. G.M. and Tesla vehicles account for a majority of models that are still eligible for the full credit.
Elaine Buckberg, a former G.M. chief economist who is now a senior fellow at the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard, wrote in a research brief published in August that years of technological improvements and a consumer aversion to gasoline price spikes had helped electric vehicle sales grow even before the climate law passed.
After Mr. Biden signed the law, she wrote, "sales continued to trend up, with no abrupt shift."
Ms. Buckberg and other researchers, like Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, have noted one big way the law has changed the electric-vehicle market: It has pushed consumers toward leasing, not buying. That's because the Treasury Department allowed leased vehicles to be treated differently under the law's domestic content requirements. Companies like Hyundai and Kia are able to capture the full $ 7,500 credit for their electric models -- and pass that on to consumers -- if they lease them.
The auto dealers association calculates that more than half of electric vehicle transactions in the United States -- excluding Teslas, which are not sold through traditional dealership models -- are leased, a large jump from a year ago.
"For a dealer, that's easier for me," said Mr. Ricart, whose holdings in Columbus include a Hyundai dealership.
It is unclear how much the tax credit changes have otherwise influenced consumers' electric vehicle choices. Tesla's sales have grown by a quarter this year -- but on top of the tax credit re-qualification, it also slashed prices.
Auto dealers and administration officials are hopeful that a feature of the law that will take effect on Jan. 1 will further increase sales. It will allow qualified buyers to immediately pass their electric vehicle credit on to a dealer, essentially using it as a down payment, instead of waiting until they file a tax return to receive money back.
Chargers remain a critical part of the equation
Two years after Congress passed a law that included $ 5 billion to install fast chargers at 50-mile intervals along major highways, only a handful of states have awarded contracts to construct stations. Chargers remain relatively scarce on most highways.
Spotty availability of fast chargers is shaping up as one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric vehicles. Most owners charge at home. But on longer voyages, they need chargers capable of charging a car in half an hour to 45 minutes.
Kara Womack, an Atlanta resident, owns a Hyundai electric car but is thinking of trading it in for a hybrid because it's too difficult to drive to visit family in Nashville.
"I don't know if I'm going to be able to find enough chargers to make it," said Ms. Womack, vice president of product at ParkMobile, which advises parking lot operators on where to place chargers. "If you've got an E.V. and you can't take it on a road trip because you can't count on the infrastructure, then it's a challenge."
Last month, modeling that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released predicted that the combination of vehicles qualifying for the consumer tax credits and the eventual build-out of the charging network under the infrastructure law would help electric vehicles make up 42 percent of all vehicles sold in America in less than a decade. That would be more than quadruple today's market share for plug-ins, and significantly higher than the result if Mr. Biden had done nothing to bolster the industry, according to the agency's study.
Billions of private investment dollars could help speed up expanding the charging network. Operators of roadside travel service centers, like Circle K, Pilot Flying J and Sheetz, are installing chargers alongside gas pumps. Carmakers, including G.M. and Mercedes-Benz, are building charging stations. Next year, much of Tesla's charging network -- the largest in the United States -- will open to other vehicles as part of an agreement with Ford, G.M. and other carmakers.
"The states are now rolling and making a lot of progress," said Andrew Dick, business development manager for Electrify America, a charging company. He added, "Things are starting to move very quickly."

Carmakers Downshift on E.V. Spending as Sales Growth Slows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Growth is brisk but slower than expected, causing automakers to question their multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and raising doubts about the effectiveness of federal incentives.
Normally a 50 percent increase in sales is considered very good. But when the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States grew that much during the third quarter from a year earlier, it was a disappointment.
Carmakers and analysts had expected more. Instead of celebrating, auto executives worried that demand for electric vehicles was slackening, raising questions about their plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new models and build factories.
In recent weeks, General Motors, Ford Motor and Tesla cited slower sales and signs that the economy was weakening in announcing that they would delay that spending. That was a blow to the Biden administration's plan to fight climate change by promoting zero-emission vehicles, and it cast doubt on whether generous federal tax credits for electric car buyers were working as well as policymakers had hoped.
"Our commitment to an all-E.V. future is as strong as ever," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., told analysts on a conference call last month. But, she added, the market is turning out to be "a bit bumpy." As a result, G.M. is waiting several months to begin selling some new electric models, including a battery-powered incarnation of the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle.
Ford and G.M. have staked billions to retool factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles, batteries and other components. If the carmakers have miscalculated, the consequences could be severe. (Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, has not yet begun selling any all-electric vehicles in the United States.)
Sales of electric vehicles in China and Europe are also growing more slowly than they were a few months ago.
Still, electric vehicle sales are growing faster than any other major category of automobile, and Americans will buy more than one million of them this year, a record. From July through September, battery-powered cars accounted for 8 percent of the new cars sold in the United States, up from 6 percent a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.
But some once-hot models are selling more slowly. Sales of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which commanded a stiff markup a year ago, slumped 10 percent in October from a year earlier, Ford said last week.
"E.V.s are still in high demand," Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, told analysts. But he added that increased competition had pushed down prices.
Carmakers have introduced at least 14 new all-electric models in the last year, according to Cox, and stepped up production of other models that had been in short supply. Inevitably, some sell better than others.
"The demand is inching up, but it's not moving up nearly to the degree that supply and production is increasing," said Rob Cochran, chief executive of #1 Cochran Automotive, which owns 34 dealerships in Pennsylvania and Ohio that sell nearly all major brands, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Volkswagen.
Even Tesla -- which dominates the electric car market, with about half of all sales in the most recent quarter -- has struggled to sell cars and had to cut prices by thousands of dollars.
Some conservatives have seized on recent data to argue that electric vehicles are overhyped. Republicans like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio have claimed electric vehicles are destroying auto industry jobs, and have proposed rolling back policies designed to encourage people to buy battery-powered cars.
A political agenda is driving some of those proclaiming an end to the electric vehicle boom, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an industry group whose members include carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, charging companies like EVgo and ChargePoint, and suppliers of equipment and raw materials.
"There are a lot of folks eager to draw a conclusion we should be less aggressive with policy," Mr. Gore said.
Some analysts said the uneven growth was not surprising as electric vehicles go from being a niche product to a more mass market offering. Most car owners are still learning about the technology, and carmakers and dealers are figuring out how best to sell to them.
"We had a lot of early adopters buy expensive electric vehicles," said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "Now you're at the point where the Main Street consumer is looking at E.V.s."
Ford illustrates the mixed signals that sales figures are sending. While sales of the Mach-E were up just 1.5 percent in the first 10 months of the year, sales of the F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered pickup, surged 43 percent. All told, sales of Ford electric vehicles rose 13 percent from January through October while sales of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines were up 7 percent. Sales of hybrid vehicles, which combine electric propulsion with internal combustion engines, climbed 19 percent.
The weak Mach-E sales probably reflect competition from the Tesla Model Y more than any broader trend, analysts said. Many buyers might be comparing the two vehicles, which are of a similar size and style. Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y so that the least expensive model is $ 2,500 less than the Ford after federal tax credits are applied.
The end of the United Automobile Workers' recent strikes against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis has refocused attention on traditional carmakers' attempts to compete with Tesla.
Electric vehicles played an important role in the U.A.W. negotiations, and tentative contract agreements extend at least some union privileges to workers at new battery factories. But the deals will increase manufacturing costs and make it that much harder for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to catch up to Tesla, which is not unionized.
Buyers remain interested in electric vehicles, surveys show, but struggle to afford them. The average price paid for an electric vehicle in the United States was less than $ 51,000 in September, according to Cox Automotive. That's a huge decline from last year's $ 65,000. But it's still too high for many new-car buyers, especially as high interest rates have made monthly car payments more expensive. The average rate on a car loan is more than 8 percent, according to Federal Reserve data, compared with less than 5 percent in early 2022.
In the last few years, carmakers flooded the market with S.U.V.s aimed at affluent suburban homeowners. And there is still a dearth of cars priced below $ 30,000 that middle-class buyers can afford.
"A lot of automakers were rushing vehicles into the market," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online car marketplace. "Now they're running into a situation in a rising interest rate environment that they are not priced properly."
Some would-be electric vehicle buyers may also be worried about finding enough places to quickly charge cars on road trips. After price, charging infrastructure is the No. 1 thing people worry about when considering an E.V., many surveys conclude.
Public charging is also essential for anyone who lives in an apartment or can't install a home charger, a group that skews young. "The younger demographic is more open to electric vehicles than the older demographic," Mr. Cochran, the Ohio and Pennsylvania dealer, said. "Typically it's the younger demographic that's in apartment settings. The fact that the infrastructure is not built up is a deterrent."
At least two of Mr. Cochran's customers returned newly purchased electric vehicles after discovering there weren't enough chargers near their homes, he said.
For people interested in buying an electric vehicle, the good news is that prices are likely to continue falling as carmakers ramp up new factories. Starting in January, dealers will be able to apply federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 when a customer buys a car. Previously, buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to claim the credit.
The charging system is also improving, albeit slowly. Parts of Tesla's network of fast chargers, the largest in the United States, will open to Ford, G.M. and other brands next year. Other carmakers are building their own chargers. Mercedes-Benz said last week that it would install at least 55 stations at high-end shopping malls in the United States and Canada operated by Simon Property Group, a large real estate firm.
Carmakers have gotten the message that selling electric vehicles is different from selling gasoline cars. "Charging," said Andrew Cornelia, chief executive of Mercedes's high-power charging unit in North America, "is still a critical problem to solve."

Based on early evidence, it is succeeding at a goal that economists have long considered difficult and costly: using the power of government to rapidly grow a new industry.
That growth could prove crucial for the other side of the electric vehicle equation: enticing more consumers to buy them. That’s because Biden’s law effectively hitches the future affordability of electric vehicles to automakers’ willingness to source and build them in the United States.
For now, the climate law has not drastically affected trends in electric vehicle sales. Americans are poised to buy 1 million electric cars and trucks for the first time this year, continuing a steady trend of increased market share for electric vehicles that began years ago.
The law’s most pronounced immediate effect on the consumer market appears to be unintended: driving many electric car shoppers to lease vehicles instead of buying them. That’s because a Treasury Department regulation enables auto dealers to avoid the law’s made-in-America requirements for cars that they buy and then lease to customers. That allows shoppers to effectively reap the full benefits of the federal tax break for models that otherwise would not qualify.
Still, analysts say, electric vehicle sales are projected to jump sharply under the right conditions. Automakers would need to continue to invest in battery and assembly plants. Administration officials must speed the deployment of charging stations meant to ease the logistics of owning and driving an electric vehicle.
Biden is trying to jump-start the electric vehicle market as the global transition to cleaner fuels is accelerating more quickly than expected. That includes the switch to electric vehicles, which are a cornerstone of efforts to reduce emissions in the sector of the U.S. economy that emits the most greenhouse gases: transportation. Government policy missteps could slow or stall that growth.
The administration’s policies to boost electric vehicles aren’t just aimed at climate change. They also seek to support middle-class jobs for Americans in the auto industry. In a best-case scenario for the administration, those goals work together. The more automakers do to meet the made-in-America requirements in the climate law, the faster the electric vehicle industry will grow to dominate the U.S. auto market.
That relationship is primarily a function of cost. Without a U.S. supply chain, electric vehicles can’t qualify for the full $7,500 consumer tax credit the law created. Without the full credit, a typical electric vehicle remains less affordable than a conventional automobile. Those requirements don’t apply to the leasing market, which explains the shift in consumer preferences.
“I think it’s going to be a long time before you see your local waitress come in and buy an EV — they’re just too expensive,” said Rhett Ricart, CEO and owner of the Ricart Automotive Group in Columbus, Ohio, and a former president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
“If we’re going to get people to buy these electric vehicles in volume,” he said, “we will need more financial assistance from the manufacturers or the government.”
Tax credits spur U.S. investment
The climate law spurred investment at a pivotal moment for American automakers. After a prolonged strike, union autoworkers won new concessions for workers who assemble electric vehicles and produce batteries at some plants that the three largest American carmakers run.
Republican leaders and some Wall Street analysts are calling on carmakers to abandon their plans and refocus on gas-guzzling SUVs. They claim the vehicle transition is effectively subsidizing China, which leads the world in electric-car technology and is home to vast stockpiles of critical minerals needed for batteries and other components.
The climate law’s champions pitched it as a way to counter China and pull mining and manufacturing to the United States. That group included Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who cast the decisive vote for the bill and wielded outsize influence on its every detail.
Under the law, companies get lucrative tax credits for investing in electric vehicle production and component parts like advanced batteries. Consumers get up to $7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. But at Manchin’s insistence, vehicles qualify for the credit only if they meet certain standards for how much of their content is made and mined in America, or in certain allied countries. Those standards get stricter every year.
Lobbyists from U.S. auto companies warned that those requirements were so stringent that most electric vehicles — other than Teslas — would not qualify. Even Tesla vehicles could soon be excluded.
To avoid losing out, automakers have announced new battery projects across the country, particularly near Detroit and through the Southeast. They include plans from foreign automakers like Hyundai that were immediately excluded from the credit but want buyers to have access to it in the future.
“The response has happened faster than I think anyone would have anticipated on the supply side in anticipation of demand increasing,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in an interview. “I think the reason you’re seeing these investments is that, ultimately, these companies see that over time, these credits are going to be quite effective in getting consumers to make a decision.”
One area where companies have been slower to invest in the United States is in the raw materials and parts needed for batteries, including mines producing minerals like cobalt, and factories making chemicals that go into batteries. In the coming weeks, the Biden administration is expected to issue more rules about when these parts can be sourced from China and other countries, which are likely to determine where many companies base new projects.
Another proposed Biden regulation, from the Environmental Protection Agency, is encouraging automakers’ investment in electric vehicle production. It seeks to ensure that two-thirds of all new passenger cars sold in the United States will be all-electric within a decade.
A Treasury rule encourages leasing
There is little evidence that the climate law has supercharged consumer demand for electric vehicles. American consumers bought about 873,000 electric vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. That put the country on a pace to surpass 1 million electric vehicle sales this year for the first time, but electric vehicles still account for not even 1 in 10 new cars and trucks sold in the United States.
The pace of that EV sales growth is actually slowing. Through the first nine months of 2022, Kelley Blue Book estimated, sales were up nearly 70% from the same period in 2021.
The climate law “certainly helped” with electric vehicle sales, said Mike Stanton, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. But, he said, “we were hoping for more.”
The law has had a mixed effect for consumers and automakers. The federal government previously offered credits to electric car buyers but capped the total that individual automakers could qualify for. Both Tesla and General Motors, the nation’s largest sellers of electric vehicles, exceeded that cap, meaning some consumers could not claim a credit for buying their cars.
The climate law restored credits for several of both companies’ electric vehicles. It also eliminated credits for many of their competitors, such as Hyundai and Kia, that assemble electric cars abroad. As of April, the number of vehicle models that qualify for the full credit had fallen by half compared with how many qualified before the climate law passed. GM and Tesla vehicles account for a majority of models that are still eligible for the full credit.
Elaine Buckberg, a former GM chief economist who is now a senior fellow at the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard, wrote in a research brief published in August that years of technological improvements and a consumer aversion to gasoline price spikes had helped electric vehicle sales grow even before the climate law passed.
After Biden signed the law, she wrote, “sales continued to trend up, with no abrupt shift.”
Buckberg and other researchers, like Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, have noted one big way the law has changed the electric vehicle market: It has pushed consumers toward leasing, not buying. That’s because the Treasury Department allowed leased vehicles to be treated differently under the law’s domestic content requirements. Companies such as Hyundai and Kia are able to capture the full $7,500 credit for their electric models — and pass that on to consumers — if they lease them.
The auto dealers association calculates that more than half of electric vehicle transactions in the United States — excluding Teslas, which are not sold through traditional dealership models — are leased, a large jump from a year ago.
“For a dealer, that’s easier for me,” said Ricart, whose holdings in Columbus include a Hyundai dealership.
It is unclear how much the tax credit changes have otherwise influenced consumers’ electric vehicle choices. Tesla’s sales have grown by one-quarter this year — but on top of the tax credit re-qualification, it also slashed prices.
Auto dealers and administration officials are hopeful that a feature of the law that will take effect on Jan. 1 will further increase sales. It will allow qualified buyers to immediately pass their electric vehicle credit on to a dealer, essentially using it as a down payment, instead of waiting until they file a tax return to receive money back.
Chargers remain a critical part of the equation
Two years after Congress passed a law that included $5 billion to install fast chargers at 50-mile intervals along major highways, only a handful of states have awarded contracts to construct stations. Chargers remain relatively scarce on most highways.
Spotty availability of fast chargers is shaping up as one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric vehicles. Most owners charge at home. But on longer voyages, they need chargers capable of charging a car in half an hour to 45 minutes.
Kara Womack, an Atlanta resident, owns a Hyundai electric car but is thinking of trading it in for a hybrid because it’s too difficult to drive to visit family in Nashville, Tennessee.
“I don’t know if I’m going to be able to find enough chargers to make it,” said Womack, vice president of product at ParkMobile, which advises parking lot operators on where to place chargers. “If you’ve got an EV and you can’t take it on a road trip because you can’t count on the infrastructure, then it’s a challenge.”
Last month, modeling that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released predicted that the combination of vehicles qualifying for the consumer tax credits and the eventual build-out of the charging network under the infrastructure law would help electric vehicles make up 42% of all vehicles sold in the United States in less than a decade. That would be more than quadruple today’s market share for plug-ins, and significantly higher than the result if Biden had done nothing to bolster the industry, according to the agency’s study.
Billions of private investment dollars could help speed up expanding the charging network. Operators of roadside travel service centers, such as Circle K, Pilot Flying J and Sheetz, are installing chargers alongside gas pumps. Carmakers, including GM and Mercedes-Benz, are building charging stations. Next year, much of Tesla’s charging network — the largest in the United States — will open to other vehicles as part of an agreement with Ford, GM and other carmakers.
“The states are now rolling and making a lot of progress,” said Andrew Dick, business development manager for Electrify America, a charging company. He added, “Things are starting to move very quickly.”

Full text: An old friend of Senator Robert Menendez was in legal trouble. The government says the senator went to great lengths to try to install a friendly prosecutor.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey had a problem -- and, prosecutors say, an opportunity. An old friend and political patron was facing federal prosecution. And as New Jersey's senior senator, Mr. Menendez was in a position to help, by recommending the next leader of the office overseeing the case.
In early 2021, Mr. Menendez urged President Biden to nominate a lawyer he knew well as the state's next U.S. attorney: Esther Suarez, a politically connected prosecutor in his home county. It did not go as planned.
When White House and Justice Department officials interviewed Ms. Suarez, they found her knowledge of federal law lacking, and they had substantial concerns about her qualifications, according to four people familiar with the sessions.
Mr. Menendez pushed for Ms. Suarez to be given another chance, the people said. But after a rare second interview, the result was the same.
The episode sheds new light on the lengths to which the government now says Mr. Menendez, a three-term Democrat, went to try to secure a friendly prosecutor in New Jersey's top federal law enforcement position. Far from being routine politics, Mr. Menendez's attempts to fill the position were part of a brazen scheme to sell his office for cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz convertible, a federal indictment says.
The indictment includes charges that Mr. Menendez conspired to direct aid and weapons sales to Egypt, fueling questions about international espionage. But back in New Jersey, the search for a U.S. attorney was the centerpiece of a far more tawdry web of alleged corruption in which the senator sought to make his friend's case vanish and pressured a senior official in the state attorney general's office to quash insurance-fraud matters on behalf of another ally.
The senator's attempts to influence the criminal matters failed.
"Fortunately, the public officials the senator sought to influence did not bend to the pressure," Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said last month when he announced the charges against Mr. Menendez, his wife and three New Jersey businessmen. One of them, Fred Daibes, was the friend Mr. Menendez had in mind when selecting a U.S. attorney.
All five defendants have pleaded not guilty. The senator said he is innocent of all wrongdoing and has vigorously rejected calls for his resignation, presenting himself as a victim of overzealous prosecutors targeting him because he is Latino.
"The government is engaged in primitive hunting, by which the predator chases its prey until it's exhausted and then kills it," Mr. Menendez said last week. "This tactic won't work."
In a separate statement to The New York Times, the senator defended Ms. Suarez's qualifications and said he had recommended her "based on her experience and credentials, both as a Latina jurist and prosecutor."
Of all the allegations against Mr. Menendez, perhaps none cuts to the heart of the justice system as directly as the accusation that he tried to install and then influence a favorable U.S. attorney who would take over the case against Mr. Daibes.
A real estate tycoon who helped build up New Jersey's waterfront, Mr. Daibes had been indicted in 2018 by the U.S. attorney's office there in a bank fraud scheme.
Traditionally, in selecting U.S. attorneys and federal judges, presidents defer to their party's senior senator in a state -- in this case, Mr. Menendez.
And so, in late 2020, Mr. Menendez began meeting with potential candidates for the post, including Philip R. Sellinger, co-head of the New Jersey office of the international law firm Greenberg Traurig and a former federal prosecutor.
Mr. Sellinger had contributed to Mr. Menendez's Senate campaigns since 2006 and had co-hosted a fund-raiser as recently as June 2020, according to an invitation. He also gave $ 40,000 to a defense fund Mr. Menendez set up in 2014 to pay legal costs associated with an earlier federal indictment, according to Open Secrets; that case ended with a hung jury.
During his meeting with Mr. Sellinger, according to prosecutors, Mr. Menendez criticized the Daibes prosecution -- the only case he mentioned -- and said he hoped Mr. Sellinger would look into it if he got the post.
After Mr. Sellinger told the senator he might have to recuse himself from the case because he had once handled a matter in private practice involving Mr. Daibes, the senator chose to recommend a different person, the indictment says. Though it does not name her, that person was widely known to be Ms. Suarez.
Ms. Suarez would have been well known to Mr. Menendez. She worked for Scarinci Hollenbeck, a law firm led by one of his oldest confidants, and as legal counsel to his hometown, Union City. In 2015, after a stint as a state judge, she was sworn in as the top prosecutor for Hudson County, where Mr. Menendez built his political network.
She developed a reputation as a solid Democrat, with close relationships to one of Mr. Menendez's protégés, Mayor Brian Stack of Union City, and Joseph Ferriero, a Democratic power broker in Bergen County twice convicted on corruption charges.
Prosecutors said in the indictment that Mr. Daibes believed Mr. Menendez's pick "would likely be sympathetic to him" if she were confirmed as U.S. attorney. They did not explain why or suggest that Mr. Menendez ever discussed the Daibes case with Ms. Suarez, leaving other Democrats to speculate.
"Esther was known as a political operative who was also a lawyer," said Loretta Weinberg, who served as majority leader of the State Senate and has clashed with Ms. Suarez. She said Mr. Menendez "would have known that she was, is and would be a friendly person."
Ms. Suarez declined to comment but asked a longtime friend to vouch for her ethics. "She is not wired for corruption," said the friend, Charles Sciarra, a criminal defense lawyer. "This is not someone who plays that game."
Ms. Suarez did have public baggage. The indictment notes that in the spring of 2021, she was the subject of critical news reports after her name was floated as a potential candidate. Articles published by The Star-Ledger focused on her role in a 2017 decision by the Hudson County prosecutor's office not to bring charges after Katie Brennan, a volunteer for Philip D. Murphy's gubernatorial campaign, accused a campaign official of sexual assault.
The case blew into a political scandal in 2018. In early 2021, Ms. Brennan and her lawyer wrote letters to Mr. Menendez, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and the White House, urging them to oppose Ms. Suarez's nomination.
Ms. Suarez struggled through her first interview with White House and Justice Department officials. Mr. Menendez's office said he never "insisted" that Ms. Suarez receive a second interview, but acknowledged that he did request one because Ms. Suarez wanted to "clarify some issues from her initial interview."
It did little to help her case; the Biden administration informed Mr. Menendez that it would not nominate Ms. Suarez. Mr. Menendez soon turned back to Mr. Sellinger.
This time, an unnamed adviser to Mr. Menendez spoke with Mr. Sellinger and came away with the impression that he might not have to be recused in the Daibes case, according to the indictment.
The indictment does not describe what Mr. Sellinger said to the adviser. But it says the adviser texted Mr. Menendez in May 2021 that if he called Mr. Sellinger, "you'll be comfortable with what he says."
With Mr. Menendez's recommendation, the White House nominated Mr. Sellinger, and he was confirmed and sworn in that December. But the Justice Department, after reviewing the matter, said he would have to recuse himself from the Daibes case, the indictments say.
Mr. Sellinger has not been accused of wrongdoing. His spokesman has said that the case was "handled appropriately" and declined further comment.
Mr. Menendez evidently continued to try to help Mr. Daibes.
In January 2022, the senator asked for the name of a deputy of Mr. Sellinger's who was now supervising the Daibes prosecution. The indictment says Mr. Menendez later called the deputy twice, though it does not detail what was said.
The senator and Mr. Daibes also called Mr. Daibes's lawyer to complain that the lawyer had not been aggressive enough in trying to get the case dismissed.
And in March, Mr. Menendez told his adviser he was frustrated with the way Mr. Sellinger's office was handling the case, the indictment says. He asked the adviser to tell Mr. Sellinger over lunch to give Mr. Daibes "all due process," even though the senator knew Mr. Sellinger was recused. The adviser did not relay the message.
Mr. Daibes's case appeared to be resolved that April, when he pleaded guilty to making false entries on a loan document -- part of an agreement that called for no prison time.
His lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, said that the deal was the result of "extended, very hard fought and good-faith negotiations between me and the U.S. attorney's office."
But this month, a federal judge in New Jersey rejected that agreement, leading Mr. Daibes to withdraw his guilty plea. That case is now pending.
The senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were rewarded for all their effort, prosecutors say. In late January 2022, Ms. Menendez exchanged two brief calls with Mr. Daibes's driver. She then texted Mr. Daibes: "Thank you. Christmas in January."
The driver's fingerprints were later found on an envelope holding thousands of dollars of cash that was recovered from the Menendezes' residence. The envelope also bore Mr. Daibes's return address and DNA, the indictment says.
Then, in March, Ms. Menendez met Mr. Daibes for lunch, and a day later, Ms. Menendez gave a jeweler two one-kilogram gold bars, asking that they be sold. Prosecutors say each bar was marked with a serial number indicating it had belonged to Mr. Daibes.
Ms. Menendez was delighted. "THANK YOU Fred," she texted him after the lunch, adding, "ð❌⭕️❤️."

With Menendez’s recommendation, the White House nominated Sellinger, and he was confirmed and sworn in that December. But the Justice Department, after reviewing the matter, said he would have to recuse himself from the Daibes case, the indictments say.
Sellinger has not been accused of wrongdoing. His spokesperson has said that the case was “handled appropriately” and declined further comment.
Menendez evidently continued to try to help Daibes.
In January 2022, the senator asked for the name of a deputy of Sellinger’s who was now supervising the Daibes prosecution. The indictment says Menendez later called the deputy twice, though it does not detail what was said.
The senator and Daibes also called Daibes’ lawyer to complain that the lawyer had not been aggressive enough in trying to get the case dismissed.
And in March, Menendez told his adviser he was frustrated with the way Sellinger’s office was handling the case, the indictment says. He asked the adviser to tell Sellinger over lunch to give Daibes “all due process,” even though the senator knew Sellinger was recused. The adviser did not relay the message.
Daibes’ case appeared to be resolved that April, when he pleaded guilty to making false entries on a loan document — part of an agreement that called for no prison time.
His lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said that the deal was the result of “extended, very hard fought and good-faith negotiations between me and the U.S. attorney’s office.”
But this month, a federal judge in New Jersey rejected that agreement, leading Daibes to withdraw his guilty plea. That case is now pending.
The senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were rewarded for all their effort, prosecutors say. In late January 2022, Nadine Menendez exchanged two brief calls with Daibes’ driver. She then texted Daibes: “Thank you. Christmas in January.”
The driver’s fingerprints were later found on an envelope holding thousands of dollars of cash that was recovered from the Menendezes’ residence. The envelope also bore Daibes’ return address and DNA, the indictment says.
Then, in March, Nadine Menendez met Daibes for lunch, and a day later, she gave a jeweler two 1-kilogram gold bars, asking that they be sold. Prosecutors say each bar was marked with a serial number indicating it had belonged to Daibes.
Nadine Menendez was delighted. “THANK YOU Fred,” she texted him after the lunch, adding pray, X, O and heart emoji.

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

Not in U.A.W. But Still Part Of the Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

In Newest Charge, Menendez Pleads Not Guilty to Plotting to Be an Agent of Egypt: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, was arraigned on Monday in Manhattan federal court. It was his second appearance there in a month.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey pleaded not guilty on Monday to a new federal charge that accused him of illegally plotting to be an agent of Egypt while serving as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
It was Mr. Menendez's second not-guilty plea in a month after he and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were accused of being at the center of a broad web of political corruption. The couple has been charged with accepting bribes in exchange for Mr. Menendez's efforts to increase aid and weapons sales to Egypt while also working to quash criminal investigations for associates in New Jersey.
The bribery-related charges were first announced last month by federal prosecutors in Manhattan; a revised indictment, made public on Oct. 12, included the new charge of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government.
Ms. Menendez, 56, pleaded not guilty to the new conspiracy charge last week, but Mr. Menendez was granted permission to appear on Monday, instead, so that he could be present in Washington for legislative business.
His appearance on Monday took less than five minutes, and he left the courthouse in Lower Manhattan without addressing questions from reporters.
Two hours later, Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, released a statement saying that he had "done nothing wrong," and remained confident he would be "found innocent" once all the facts were presented.
"I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country -- the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom," Mr. Menendez, 69, said.
"The government is engaged in primitive hunting, by which the predator chases its prey until it's exhausted and then kills it," he added. "This tactic won't work."
Three New Jersey businessmen, including Wael Hana, a U.S. citizen born in Egypt who founded a halal certification company based in Edgewater, N.J., have also pleaded not guilty to participating in the corruption scheme.
Investigators found bars of gold bullion and $ 550,000 in cash during searches of the Menendezes' home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and of a safe deposit box. Prosecutors have asked a judge to seize their home and a Mercedes-Benz convertible that the government says was given to them as a bribe.
Last week, Judge Sidney H. Stein refused to permit Mr. Hana to remove the electronic monitor he is required to wear as a condition of his release on a $ 5 million bond.
Judge Stein called the request premature, noting Mr. Hana's $ 25 million in assets and his extensive connections to the Egyptian government, and, specifically, to Egyptian intelligence officers.
"So while we hope that Mr. Hana does not intend to flee the United States," Judge Stein said, "were he to try to do so, common sense alone would tell you he might well have the assistance of folks to get him a passport, so the mere surrender of his travel documents is not sufficient."
Mr. Menendez, who until last month was the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has remained defiant in the face of the federal charges, ignoring calls from dozens of onetime allies who have urged him to resign.
Judge Stein has set May 6 as a trial date; defense lawyers and prosecutors agreed last week to pause the speedy trial clock until then to provide enough time to review the roughly 7.7 million pages of discovery records collected from 50 electronic devices analyzed during the investigation.
Paul M. Monteleoni, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said that would give the parties time to review discovery material, file motions, prepare for trial "and potentially to discuss the disposition of the case."
On Monday, a coalition of 25 organizations, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Center for American Progress, Project on Government Oversight, and Public Citizen, sent a letter to Mr. Menendez requesting that he resign.
"These allegations paint a damning picture of a senator who seemingly repeatedly placed his own personal interests above the United States' national security and democratic process," the letter stated.
But the senator, who had been planning to run for re-election to a fourth full term next year, has given no indication that he intended to step down. A fund-raiser he held last weekend at an exclusive beachfront resort in Puerto Rico drew few donors, but he has roughly $ 8.6 million in campaign cash, which could be used to pay legal costs. A separate defense fund he set up over the summer has raised $ 275,000 from about 30 individuals and organizations, Senate records show.
The fund returned a $ 5,000 donation last month from a New Jersey law firm run by Donald Scarinci, a longtime friend of Mr. Menendez's. Mr. Scarinci said he was unsure why the donation was rejected, but indicated that it might have been because it came from his company, not his private bank account.
"Bob has been my personal friend for a lifetime," Mr. Scarinci said in an email. "As his friend, I am there for him in his time of need. I fully intend to contribute to his defense fund."

Full text: As deepfakes and A.I. images proliferate, hyperrealist sculpture has taken on an eerie new relevance.
THIS PAST SUMMER, a naked man was suspended from the wall of Galerie Georges-Philippe & Nathalie Vallois in Paris, his arms spread-eagle, resembling something between a crucified person and a cadaver. Onlookers couldn't help but wince. One aghast couple seemed to turn their heads away. But like the dangling body, they, too, were unclothed sculptures -- lifeless yet eerily lifelike.
The work was from "Grace," an exhibition by the American sculptor John DeAndrea, who at 81 has been making human doppelgängers like these in a studio near the Rocky Mountains for almost six decades. His monthslong process involves first putting live models in silicone rubber molds, which are cured and then built up with layers of plaster. This negative mold is then filled with fortified plaster, which is cured, perfected and eventually recast in bronze. Finally, DeAndrea meticulously applies layers of opaque and transparent oil paints to the skin and eyes and adds hair until everything looks creepily authentic.
Art critics have come up with various terms for work like DeAndrea's, including hyperrealism, although DeAndrea notably has said he doesn't consider himself an artist. Perhaps a better name for it comes from Sigmund Freud. In response to a 1906 essay by the German psychiatrist Ernst Jentsch, who wrote of the discomfort that arises when the viewer "doubts whether an apparently animate being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might not be in fact animate," Freud expanded on the concept of the uncanny. It's the place where art and life converge and briefly become muddled, in a way that's confusing and uncomfortable.
Why do artists keep returning to the uncanny, which Freud placed into "that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar"? The hyperreal would seem to represent a very modern state of uncertainty: What is that thing? How can it look both recognizable and foreign at the same time? It's an aesthetic that tends to return at particularly unstable moments in history. Freud wrote about the uncanny in 1919, months after the end of World War I, which had left millions dead and Europe in ruins. DeAndrea -- who says his work "ain't dark" to him -- in the mid-1960s began experimenting with casting techniques that would allow him to accurately represent the human body, though he was probably less concerned with the Vietnam War than with the narcissism of what the author Tom Wolfe would later describe as the Me Generation. Other hyperrealists, most notably DeAndrea's contemporary Duane Hanson, were more overtly political. Hanson didn't shy away from the war in Vietnam or American racism -- his 1969 "Vietnam Scene" depicts dead and wounded U.S. soldiers lying on the floor -- though he's best remembered for his fiberglass-and-polyester-resin sculptures of tourists in southern Florida.
Each subsequent decade has gotten the hyperrealist sculpture it deserves. Right now we're living in a moment defined by an erosion of trust in what is and isn't real -- whether that's a former president's election fraud claims or the proliferation of deepfakes and artificial intelligence software. The uncanny valley has transformed from a horror film trope -- in movies from Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979) to John Carpenter's "The Thing" (1982) to the unsettlingly human robot in "M3gan" (2023) -- into a more quotidian concern, as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos propose a fleet of humanoid robots to address the U.S. labor shortage. It's possible that hyperrealist art has never felt as topical, or as chilling, as it does today, and advancements in technology have also rendered the style more real than it's ever been.
OVER TIME, HYPERREALISM incorporated elements of extreme exaggeration, which only seemed to heighten the shock of the uncanny. That effect is palpable in, for instance, the Australian artist Ron Mueck's gargantuan child made of glass fiber, "Boy" (1999): Installed in the ARoS museum in Aarhus, Denmark, the child is nearly 15 feet tall, even crouched in an almost fetal position, and all his details are rendered with excruciating precision.
The Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, a master of discomfort, has contributed to the hyperrealist tradition for more than 20 years. His funny and disturbing "La Nona Ora" (1999) shows Pope John Paul II in his papal regalia, writhing in pain on the ground after being struck down by a small meteor. The pope retains an odd dignity, still clutching a staff with a crucifix on it, as if that might help him through this encounter. Two years later, Cattelan made "Him," a dreadfully realistic sculpture of Adolf Hitler, kneeling like an altar boy, hands clasped as if in prayer. As in the work centering the pope, it's the absurdity of the contrast -- between evil and innocence -- that's so effective and obscene. "It is a fake until proven otherwise," explained Cattelan of his installations of this nature.
Many works of hyperrealism call on old traditions of mimesis, among them anatomical wax models based on real carcasses, a technique dating to the 18th century. Lately, though, new technology has made hyperrealism easier for humans to achieve, while simultaneously complicating the practice. The Australian visual artist Patricia Piccinini, 57, has been making anthropomorphic chimeras out of silicone, fiberglass, leather and human hair for the past two decades: a grotesque porcine creature, its brood suckling at its teats (2002's "The Young Family"); a bearlike man who could pass for a shaved Bigfoot (2012's "The Carrier"). Recently, however, she had a disconcerting encounter of her own when she came across images of artworks online that appeared to be attributed to her. "It had my name on it, but it wasn't me," the artist said. It was the product of an A.I. art generator -- one that used randomized machine learning to mimic her reimaginations. "What I saw looked like it had been made by someone who had only been told about my work by someone who didn't understand it," she said.
It's a worrying development for any artist, but also one that has made human-engineered hyperrealism even more relevant -- us versus the machines. In 2011, the Austrian-born sculptor Erwin Wurm, 69, modified a red Mercedes-Benz MB100D van so that its rear half curved up the side of a wall. When it was installed four years later outside of the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, a traffic warden gave it a parking ticket. Wurm says that we live in an age when our brains are constantly trying to make sense of what we see. "Is it nature or is it copying nature?" he asked. "You think it's nature, but then you realize, 'Wait a moment, it's not. It's something else.' "
With his series of "One Minute Sculptures," begun in 1988, Wurm has taken hyperrealism to its inevitable extreme: He's turned actual people into bizarre and improbable sculptures. He directs strangers to participate in seemingly impossible scenes -- in which office supplies protrude out of orifices, or a forehead is attached to a leaning tower of oranges -- instructing them to pose for 60 seconds or less as he photographs them.
"Reality is totally insane, we have to compete with it," said Wurm. That, ultimately, is why such art matters: By jolting us out of our usual perspective, it makes us question what we may be overlooking every day. "I see the world going in a strange direction," Wurm added, "and I'm scared for the future."

At Menendez Fund-Raiser, Donors Were Scarce. So Was He.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An event in Puerto Rico to benefit Senator Robert Menendez's political action committee suffered numerous cancellations after the senator's indictment.
At Puerto Rico's most exclusive beachfront resort, where shoulder season rooms go for $ 1,500 a night, deep-pocketed donors have reliably lined up to pay tribute to Senator Robert Menendez in the form of a $ 5,000 check to his political action committee.
But this year's retreat imploded, as donors quickly distanced themselves from Mr. Menendez after he was indicted on federal bribery charges, turning the once powerful Democrat from New Jersey into a pariah at his own fund-raiser last weekend.
The opening reception on Friday evening was pared down to three small tables overlooking the beach. There were still open seats: Only about a dozen people showed up to the subdued affair and roughly half of them were the senator's aides. Trays of sushi and shrimp cocktail were left uneaten.
The shunned senator never showed, absent at his own ill-timed and ill-fated fund-raiser.
More than half of the 50-or-so donors and their guests canceled attendance after the senator was charged three weeks ago. A defiant Mr. Menendez refused to cancel the retreat despite the defections. Then, as he landed in San Juan on Thursday, he was buffeted with more untimely news: Prosecutors filed additional charges and asked a judge to seize his home.
The fund-raiser would normally have given donors a prime opportunity to get access to the senator and his team, lobbying for various causes in a relaxed setting. The retreat was supposed to include a round of golf with Mr. Menendez and a poolside lunch with his chief of staff.
But the awkward prospect of mingling with a scandal-ridden senator caused many of the remaining donors to pull out just a day before the retreat. In the end, only a handful of guests and their partners made the trip to Puerto Rico, but even some who stayed at the resort did not turn up to the scheduled receptions.
Neither did Mr. Menendez.
The annual retreat's collapse was a stark reflection of the senator's sudden isolation and diminished stature, abandoned by droves of one-time allies as he fights for political survival. It also underscored the uphill climb he could face to raise money to pay for an expected re-election campaign and for lawyers to fight corruption accusations he has vehemently denied.
About 1,500 miles away in New Jersey, an air of inevitability of Mr. Menendez's imminent political demise has settled in, after the senator was accused of using his elected office to benefit the Egyptian government and three business men in return for bribes that included wads of cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible and gold bullion bars.
Donors said they turned down requests from Mr. Menendez's finance director to contribute to his defense fund. A 41-year-old New Jersey congressman, Andy Kim, announced he would challenge the senator in a Democratic primary. And other potential candidates began to work back channels as they assessed whether to make a run for Mr. Menendez's seat, including the wife of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, Tammy Murphy, who has never even held elective office.
The political pall surrounding the senator extended to Puerto Rico, where he and his wife kept a low profile at the hotel, the Ritz-Carlton Reserve at Dorado Beach, a high-end resort about a 30-minute drive west of San Juan that is lined with 2.5 miles of beach and dotted with golf courses and massive villas.
The senator skipped both the welcome and farewell receptions. It is unclear if he played golf with donors as he was scheduled to do so on Saturday morning; an employee at the golf course said Mr. Menendez did not appear to have a tee time. But he did emerge from hiding to have a solitary dinner with his wife, Nadine Menendez, who has also been charged in the bribery scandal.
In many ways, the 1,900-acre natural reserve is an ideal hideaway for a politician looking to escape controversy or to mingle, away from prying eyes: It is only open to residents, local members and guests willing to pay as much as $ 4,500-a-night for an oceanside suite during hurricane season.
For the past few years, it has served as the go-to venue for Mr. Menendez to host scores of lobbyists from blue-chip corporations and to raise money for New Millennium PAC, which Mr. Menendez, known as a prolific fund-raiser, has long used to steer generous contributions to other lawmakers and candidates to increase his clout among colleagues in Capitol Hill.
Samantha Maltzman, a spokeswoman for the New Millennium PAC, denied that the retreat had been a failure and did not say how much was raised.
"The fund-raiser was very successful, and, in fact, the senator and his wife did have drinks/meet with several of the attendees," she said in an emailed statement. "We look forward to hosting the event again next year, however, we will not comment further as we always preserve the privacy of our guests."
New Millennium PAC has raised more than $ 5.2 million since Mr. Menendez was elected to the Senate in 2006, amassing contributions from big corporations like Microsoft, Pfizer, Wells Fargo, General Motors, AT&T and Fox Corp. While it has showered lots of that money on other candidates and campaigns, Democrats in competitive races returned or donated some of those contributions when Mr. Menendez was accused in a different corruption case eight years ago.
There are few restrictions on how Mr. Menendez can spend the money.
In 2014 and 2015, for example, the PAC transferred $ 20,000 to the legal defense trust that Mr. Menendez assembled to help pay for the lawyers that represented him when he was accused in the earlier corruption case. (Mr. Menendez was acquitted in that case after the trial ended in a hung jury in 2017.)
The PAC had just over $ 600,000 in the bank at the end of June, while his campaign account, which he could also tap to finance his legal fees, has roughly $ 8.6 million, according to the most recent filings.
Among the few supporters who did attend the retreat this year was Michael Hutton, a lobbyist who served as Mr. Menendez's chief of staff in the House of Representatives in the 1990s and early 2000s. Mr. Hutton, who runs his own lobbying firm on K Street, has appeared to keep close ties to Mr. Menendez since he switched to the private sector.
After Mr. Menendez was first sworn in to the Senate in 2007, Mr. Hutton reportedly threw him a private party in Washington, D.C., that was funded by corporate donors. And he has made at least $ 70,000 in contributions to Mr. Menendez's campaigns and PAC over two decades.
Mr. Hutton did not reply to a request for comment on Monday.
Also present at the receptions was Javier Ortiz, a partner at an investment firm, Falcon Cyber Investments, who has donated mostly to Republican politicians, including former President Donald J. Trump, according to filings. He has also given $ 37,000 since 2017 to Mr. Menendez's campaign and PAC.
Reached for comment after the retreat, Mr. Ortiz would not to say if he had met with Mr. Menendez and pointed to the senator's presumption of innocence under the U.S. legal system.
"I'm an American that supports Americans," he said repeatedly during a brief phone interview when asked about his attendance.
After so many donors dropped out this year, the retreat was relegated to more of a weekend getaway for Mr. Menendez and his staffers.
On Saturday evening, the senator's chief of staff, his press aides and a hired fund-raiser gathered with a handful of guests for the retreat's farewell reception and mingled by the beach over plantain chips and seafood appetizers.
Down the beach, Mr. Menendez donned dark pants and a blue tucked-in polo shirt as he strode into the hotel's pricey restaurant with Ms. Menendez. They appeared to sit alone for a quick dinner, then disappeared again.
Under the terms of their indictment, Mr. Menendez may continue to travel for official business; his wife, who surrendered her passport, is required to obtain permission from a federal judge or prosecutors if she wants to travel outside of New Jersey, New York, Washington, D.C., or Florida.
The couple's stealth presence in Puerto Rico was noted by hotel guests, with one discussing the sighting with a friend at the hotel bar, where guests sipped on $ 25 cocktails over live bossa nova music.
"It seems like the best way to get out of the spotlight for bribery is to go to the most expensive resort in America," the guest quipped.

The Developer Whose Fingerprints Are on the Menendez Indictment: [National Desk]

Full text: Fred Daibes, a New Jersey builder, was accused of defrauding a bank that he had founded. Prosecutors say he turned to Senator Robert Menendez for help.
Fred Daibes, the New Jersey real estate tycoon at the center of an international scandal threatening the career of Senator Robert Menendez, has found his way out of more than one tough spot over the course of his tumultuous life.
He spent his first 10 years in a Palestinian refugee camp before emigrating to New Jersey, court records show. At 20, after his father died, he dropped out of college to support four younger siblings, a decision that paved the way to a wildly successful career building luxury housing in Edgewater, N.J. In 2013, he survived a vicious beating inside his penthouse apartment there.
But in 2018, he faced a challenge that was far different. A 14-count federal indictment accusing him of scheming to defraud a bank he had founded threatened to upend his real estate empire and carried the risk of a lengthy prison term.
It was then, prosecutors say, that he turned to a longtime ally for help: Senator Menendez.
What followed would form the basis for federal charges that Mr. Daibes, Mr. Menendez and his wife, Nadine, and two other businessmen are now facing. All five have pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Daibes, 66, was accused of giving the Menendezes bribes in exchange for the Democratic senator's efforts to help him in the bank fraud case by installing a U.S. attorney inclined to ease up on the prosecution. Envelopes stuffed with cash bearing Mr. Daibes's fingerprints and nine bars of gold bullion with serial numbers tracked to him were seized during a search of Mr. Menendez's home, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.
Still, the senator's effort to meddle in the bank-fraud case failed, prosecutors said.
"I don't want him to be upset over it," Mr. Daibes wrote in a text message to Ms. Menendez as his case proceeded toward trial. "This is not his fault he was amazing in all he did he's an amazing friend and as loyal as they come."
In the end, there was no trial. Mr. Daibes pleaded guilty to a single count of making false entries in connection with a $ 1.8 million loan document as part of an agreement, approved by the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, that required no prison time.
Last week, however, a judge rejected that plea agreement, scuttling the original deal altogether and complicating an already sprawling web of allegations that poses new threats to Mr. Daibes's real estate empire.
On Friday, his lawyer in the New Jersey federal case, Lawrence S. Lustberg, formally withdrew Mr. Daibes's guilty plea.
Both cases -- the accusations of bank fraud and bribery -- have tainted Mr. Daibes's legacy as the chief architect of Edgewater's rebirth.
Forty years ago, the borough of Edgewater was struggling. The narrow ribbon of land adjacent to the Hudson River, facing Manhattan, was once home to factories where Ford manufactured cars, Alcoa made toothpaste tubes and Quanta Resources produced roofing tar. But the companies had shut down, leaving environmental contamination in their wake.
In the 1980s, Mr. Daibes, a mason's son, hopped on a wave of postindustrial redevelopment already taking place downriver, in Hoboken and Jersey City. While taxpayers financed much of Edgewater's environmental cleanup, Daibes Enterprises built thousands of residential units, plus office suites, retail complexes and a golf range. Its working-class bars long gone, Edgewater's bustling business district today includes Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, multiple fine restaurants and a seven-story day spa with a rooftop pool.
As Mr. Daibes's high-rises went up, the population roughly tripled -- to 14,600 -- over three decades.
Robert D'Angelo, the owner of Roberto's II, a family-run restaurant in business since 1962 in Edgewater, said Mr. Daibes put the borough on the map yet never forgot his humble roots.
After Hurricane Sandy, Mr. D'Angelo said Mr. Daibes was one of the first people to arrive at the restaurant once the roads reopened. Mr. Daibes helped him clean up and put him in touch with electricians, plumbers and carpenters.
"Without him, it would have taken me months to reopen," Mr. D'Angelo, 63, said.
"He took himself up from the bottom and he never forgot anyone on the way up," he added.
A local media fixture, Mr. Daibes was featured in a magazine spread about his classic and exotic car collection, including a red 1957 Jaguar XK140, a silver 2005 Bentley Continental GT with a turbocharged W-12 engine and a pair of Mercedes-Benz SLR McLarens.
His high profile, though, came at a cost. Two days before Thanksgiving, in 2013, four people broke into his penthouse at the St. Moritz, one of his buildings, tied a bag over his head and beat him, breaking his ribs, dislocating a shoulder and bruising his face. They left with at least $ 2 million in cash, gold and jewelry. When they were arrested, one turned out to be a confidant of Mr. Daibes living in the same building. The four struck plea agreements to serve 12 to 18 years in prison.
Last month, prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed a 39-page indictment against Mr. Daibes, the Menendezes and the two other businessmen, Wael Hana and Jose Uribe.
It said that Mr. Daibes provided financial backing to Mr. Hana, an Egyptian-American businessman who was later awarded a lucrative contract giving his company, IS EG Halal, the sole rights to certify that products imported to Egypt had been prepared according to Islamic law. IS EG Halal operates from a building in Edgewater owned by a company run by Mr. Daibes, who also has offices there.
In turn, Mr. Menendez, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, helped direct aid and weapons to Egypt, prosecutors said.
Mr. Daibes's lawyer in the Manhattan criminal case, Tim Donohue, said his client's financial link to Mr. Hana was limited to an "arms-length loan."
"Mr. Daibes is not an owner or investor in that business," Mr. Donohue said about IS EG Halal.
By then, Mr. Daibes was a major fund-raiser for Mr. Menendez, a Democratic power broker who has represented the region since he was appointed to the Senate in 2006, prosecutors and federal election records show.
Similar generosity had helped earn Mr. Daibes a role as kingmaker in Edgewater, at the expense of taxpayers, according to a recent state investigation.
Mr. Daibes provided Edgewater officials free or reduced rents in apartment buildings he owned and awarded a flooring job to a councilman's company in exchange for favorable treatment in business deals, state investigators found.
"Daibes's power and influence within Edgewater were so strong he even held sway in local political decisions and other municipal concerns," New Jersey's Commission of Investigation found.
"Municipal officers who took official actions unsupportive of the developer faced political and professional retribution," investigators added. Mr. Daibes, through his lawyer, has rebutted the allegations and said that the rental benefits were gifts provided to longtime friends.
At least one of the subpoenas issued, before the three-count indictment was announced last month in Manhattan, requested information about legislation pending in New Jersey that could have derailed a major high-rise residential project Mr. Daibes was planning at 115 River Road in Edgewater.
The project had lost its financing after getting bogged down in a delayed environmental cleanup, court records show. But late last year, Mr. Daibes traveled to London and Qatar to meet with potential new lenders.
In January, he finalized a $ 45-million shared-ownership agreement for the Edgewater project with a company founded by a member of Qatar's royal family, Bergen County deed records show. It is unclear how his new legal challenges might affect that project.
A judge has scheduled trial on the bribery-related charges for May 2024, in a courthouse in Lower Manhattan, 10 miles from Edgewater.

Full text: Prosecutors said he acted on behalf of Egypt even as he served as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat charged last month with taking bribes in exchange for lucrative political favors, faced a stunning new accusation on Thursday -- that he conspired to act as an agent of Egypt even as he served as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Manhattan federal prosecutors filed the latest charge against Mr. Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, as well as a third defendant, Wael Hana, accusing them of conspiring to have the senator work on Egypt's behalf without registering with the Justice Department.
The prosecutors have asked a judge to seize the Menendezes' residence in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., as well as a Mercedes-Benz convertible that the government says was given to them as a bribe.
The alleged actions underlying the latest charge cut to the heart of Mr. Menendez's Senate oath to "bear true faith and allegiance" to the U.S. Constitution and are certain to intensify pressure for him to resign from office. The charge accuses him of conspiring to violate an explicit prohibition on public officials serving as agents of foreign powers, and it appears to be the first time a sitting senator has been charged with conduct covered by the World War II-era Foreign Agents Registration Act.
Mr. Menendez, 69, Nadine Menendez, 56, Mr. Hana and two other businessmen were accused last month in what prosecutors and F.B.I. officials described as a scheme to use the senator's influence to increase U.S. aid and military sales to Egypt in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars, bars of gold bullion and the Mercedes-Benz.
The new indictment charges that from 2018 through 2022, Mr. Menendez, his wife and Mr. Hana conspired to have the senator act as an agent of Egypt in a bribery plot furthered during meetings and dinners attended by the Menendezes, Mr. Hana and Egyptian officials in various combinations.
In a Washington steakhouse in May 2019, prosecutors said, Ms. Menendez asked, "What else can the love of my life do for you?"
In court hearings last month, all five defendants pleaded not guilty.
"I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country -- the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom," Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, said in a statement released by his office on Thursday.
"Piling new charge upon new charge does not make the allegations true," Mr. Menendez said. "The facts haven't changed, only a new charge. It is an attempt to wear someone down, and I will not succumb to this tactic. I again ask people who know me and my record to give me the chance to present my defense and show my innocence."
Nadine Menendez's lawyer, David Schertler, said in a statement that she denied all the allegations, and that "we will fight all these charges, as appropriate, in court."
Mr. Hana's lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, scoffed at the new conspiracy charge.
"The new allegation that Wael Hana was part of a plot concocted over dinner to enlist Senator Menendez as an agent of the Egyptian government is as absurd as it is false," Mr. Lustberg said in a statement, adding that Mr. Hana would "vigorously defend" himself.
After the initial indictment was made public last month, Mr. Menendez stepped down from his position as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. But he has rejected calls from fellow Democrats to resign from the Senate.
Several Democrats in New Jersey and Washington went further on Thursday, calling for the Senate to vote to expel him. They included Representative Andy Kim, a congressman seeking to defeat Mr. Menendez in a primary next year, and Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.
"It is time for every one of my colleagues in the Senate to join me in expelling Senator Menendez," Mr. Fetterman said. "We cannot have an alleged foreign agent in the United States Senate. This is not a close call."
In a sign of his defiant stance, Mr. Menendez was scheduled to host a major fund-raising retreat for donors of his political action committee starting Friday at a luxury resort in Puerto Rico. Officials in New Jersey who had contributed to the senator's leadership PAC or past campaigns said as recently as Wednesday that they were also getting calls from people close to Mr. Menendez asking them to contribute to the senator's defense fund.
The indictment last month accused Mr. Menendez of secretly editing and ghost writing a letter in May 2018 on behalf of an Egyptian government official meant to persuade other senators to release a hold on $ 300 million in U.S. military aid.
He wrote the letter at the urging of Ms. Menendez, the indictment said, and then sent it to her via his private email account. She then sent it on to Mr. Hana, who passed it to Egyptian officials, the indictment suggests.
The new indictment suggests that Mr. Menendez was fully aware of the requirements of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In fact, the indictment says, Mr. Menendez during that period asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into a former member of Congress for failing to register under the law known as FARA.
In a May 2020 letter to the head of the department's national security division, Mr. Menendez wrote, "The Act is clear that acting directly or indirectly in any capacity on behalf of a foreign principal triggers the requirement to register under FARA."
Mr. Menendez posted that communication on his Senate office website, the indictment says. The May 2020 letter from Mr. Menendez to a Justice Department official asks for a review of whether David M. Rivera, a former Republican congressman from Florida, should have registered as a foreign agent for work he had done for the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.
"The last thing we should tolerate is a former member of Congress potentially violating U.S. laws as he does the regime's dirty work in the United States," Mr. Menendez wrote.
Mr. Rivera was charged in December in the Southern District of Florida with conspiracy, failure to register as a foreign agent and other crimes, according to an indictment.
This is not the first time that Mr. Menendez has faced federal corruption charges. He was indicted in New Jersey in 2015 in what prosecutors described as a bribery scheme to trade political favors for a wealthy eye doctor for gifts worth close to $ 1 million, including high-end travel and campaign contributions.
The case went to trial in 2017 but ended in a hung jury.
The new charge left historians grasping for precedents. An Ohio senator was accused of conspiring to commit treason in the early 19th century. But Mr. Menendez is the first senator charged with conduct covered under the foreign agents law since Congress passed it in the 1930s to target Nazi propagandists. According to records from the Senate historian's office, he also appears to be the first sitting senator ever charged in two separate bribery schemes.
Ross K. Baker, a politics professor who studies Congress at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the accusations are as grave as any brought against a senator over the past century.
"This rises well above things like trade secrets or corporate information," he said. "The oath is unequivocal in terms of loyalty to the Constitution of the United States."

Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who was charged last month with taking bribes in exchange for lucrative political favors, faced a stunning new accusation Thursday: that he conspired to act as an agent of Egypt even as he served as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Manhattan federal prosecutors filed the latest charge against Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, as well as a third defendant, Wael Hana, accusing them of conspiring to have the senator work on Egypt’s behalf without registering with the Justice Department.

The charge accuses him of conspiring to violate an explicit prohibition on public officials serving as agents of foreign powers and appears to be the first time a sitting senator has been charged with conduct covered by the World War II-era Foreign Agents Registration Act.
Menendez, 69; Nadine Menendez, 56; Hana; and two other businesspeople were accused last month in what prosecutors and FBI officials described as a scheme to use the senator’s influence to increase U.S. aid and military sales to Egypt in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars, bars of gold bullion and the Mercedes-Benz.

NJ Attorney General Opens Inquiry Into Nadine Menendez’s Fatal Crash

The New Jersey attorney general’s office seized records Thursday from Bergen County law enforcement agencies to review whether the investigation of a fatal 2018 car crash involving the soon-to-be wife of Sen. Bob Menendez was handled properly, two officials said.
Nadine Menendez, who was dating the senator at the time of the crash, was released by police without a summons or a sobriety test after she struck and killed Richard Koop, 49, while driving at night along a wide, two-lane boulevard in Bogota, New Jersey, police records show.
After a brief investigation, police determined that Nadine Menendez, 56, was “not at fault” and that Koop, who had marijuana and alcohol in his system, had been jaywalking as he walked across the street to his apartment. Nadine Menendez told officers that Koop “jumped on my windshield”; no charges were filed.
The attorney general’s office began its inquiry a day after details of the collision were reported publicly for the first time by The New York Times and The Record of New Jersey, nearly five years after it happened. A review by the Times of police reports, dashcam footage, 911 call recordings and a video of the collision raises new questions about the rigor of an investigation that Koop’s relatives have long believed was inadequate.
The renewed scrutiny could create fresh legal and political peril for Bob Menendez, a Democrat, and his wife, who were indicted last month alongside three New Jersey businesspeople in a brazen bribery scheme. They have each pleaded not guilty, including to an allegation that they received as a bribe a new Mercedes-Benz convertible to replace Nadine Menendez’s car, which was damaged in the crash.
The investigation began as new details of the case emerged.
On Friday, a friend told the Times that at the time of the crash, Menendez had been driving to meet a group of people for dinner, including a former top Hackensack police official, Michael Mordaga. The friend said Mordaga was the unnamed former officer who can be heard on a dashcam video talking with the Bogota police who investigated the crash.
The attorney general’s public integrity unit will review all records generated by the Bogota Police Department and the Bergen County Prosecutor’s office to determine if the investigation into the fatal crash was handled appropriately, according to the two officials, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. New Jersey’s attorney general, Matthew Platkin, has authority over all police agencies and county prosecutors’ offices in the state. His investigation was first reported by NBC News.
Leaders of the Bogota Police Department have not returned phone calls or responded to in-person queries about the incident for days. On Thursday, an officer, Kevin Geraghty, referred a reporter to the borough attorney, William Betesh, who said he had “no comment in this matter.”
Christopher Kelemen, the borough’s Republican mayor, and every member of Bogota’s elected council declined to comment, citing a directive from Betesh. Several members of the council said they had been unaware of the crash or the high-profile driver involved until this week — even though state records show it was the small borough’s only traffic fatality in at least a 10-year period.
Elizabeth Rebein, a spokesperson for the Bergen County Prosecutor’s office, said she had no information to provide about the seizure of records or the attorney general’s review.
The issue briefly burst into the open at a town meeting in Bogota on Thursday night when Jorge Nunez, a former council member, spoke up to say he wanted to know more about the police response. “I’m not the only one to not feel good about my community, our community,” he said.
Neither Bob Menendez nor his wife had ever reached out to the Koop family to express condolences. Nadine Menendez’s lawyer, David Schertler, called Koop’s death a “tragic accident” but said Nadine Menendez “was not at fault, did not violate any laws and was therefore not charged with any crimes.”
“We are confident that any ‘reopening’ of an investigation into the accident will confirm that conclusion,” Schertler added in an email Friday.
Federal prosecutors in New York City charged the senator and his wife in a wide-ranging 39-page indictment. Prosecutors said the couple accepted bribes including bars of gold bullion and mortgage payments in exchange for Bob Menendez using his political clout to stifle criminal investigations and to steer aid and weapons to Egypt.
Although they did not share details of the fatal December 2018 collision, prosecutors said in the indictment that Nadine Menendez had been in an “accident” that month that left her without a car. They said that the senator then agreed to try to halt a state criminal investigation tied to an associate in exchange for a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible.
Platkin’s office had previously announced it would investigate the senator’s alleged effort to interfere with the state investigation. That review will be expanded to include a review of the fatal crash that preceded it.
A spokesperson for Platkin had no comment about the inquiry.
Nadine Menendez’s car struck Koop as he was walking toward his home after being dropped off on the opposite side of the street, according to his relatives and police records. His body was thrown toward the curb by the impact. Both of his shoes flew off, one landing in the center of the street and the other on the sidewalk in front of his apartment. By the time police arrived, he had no pulse.
A passerby placed the first 911 call. Menendez called the police four minutes after the crash, telling a 911 dispatcher that Koop had jumped onto her car, an explanation she repeated to a Bogota officer investigating the crash.
At some point, Menendez apparently called a friend, Rosemarie Sorce, the well-connected wife of a New Jersey developer and a prolific donor to Bob Menendez’s Senate campaigns.
In a statement to the Times, Sorce said her husband had invited Mordaga, a close family friend, to dinner that night with Nadine Menendez at I Gemelli, a restaurant in South Hackensack. The three of them drove to the accident scene in Bogota after Menendez called her about the crash.
Mordaga, who served as chief of detectives for the Bergen County Prosecutor’s office and as the police director in Hackensack, can be heard on a police recording identifying himself as a retired officer and asking whether the police planned to involve the prosecutors.
“I don’t even know her,” he says in the recording. “That’s my buddy’s wife who’s friends with her. He said could you do me a favor and take her up there, because her friend just got in a car accident.”
Sorce said that she did not believe Mordaga and Nadine Menendez had ever met, even though they were to have dinner together that night.
“Nadine was very upset and distraught, but she was not intoxicated or impaired in any way,” Sorce said. She asserted that Menendez did not know that night that Koop, whose body lay badly mangled just feet from her car, had died.
The group, including Menendez, later continued on to the restaurant, where Sorce said she remembered ordering some food before Mordaga drove Menendez home.
Mordaga did not return repeated requests for comment.
Bob Menendez was in Washington the night of the collision. It remains unclear whether Nadine Menendez called him.
Koop’s death has been the only motor vehicle fatality in Bogota, a small suburban borough of about 8,000 people near the Hackensack River, since 2013, according to state data. It was one of 19 pedestrian fatalities in Bergen County in 2018, a figure that has fluctuated only slightly in recent years, according to state data. Driving while intoxicated was a factor in nearly one-third of the 524 fatal car crashes in New Jersey that year.
Police officers, who must have probable cause to test a driver for alcohol, did not test Nadine Menendez, even though days after the crash, police investigators still sought to prove Koop had been drinking that night.
State records show that a majority of surviving drivers involved in fatal crashes are not tested for alcohol. Only 30% of surviving drivers were tested in 2018, while most pedestrians killed, 154 out of 175, were tested for alcohol, presumably through autopsies.
The Bogota police report largely relies on Menendez’s account of what happened. In it, police officers note that they briefly asked to see her phone but that she quickly asked for it back. The report does not indicate whether they asked if she had been distracted or was speeding, or otherwise tried to verify that she was following the law.
Also on Thursday, in a sign of the complicated and interwoven nature of the charges Bob Menendez faces, a federal judge rejected a guilty plea that one of the senator’s co-defendants, Fred Daibes, made over a year ago in an unrelated bank fraud case.
Daibes, a New Jersey developer who was accused last month of giving the senator and his wife bribes, had pleaded guilty to making false entries in connection with a loan document. The $1.8 million loan was paid back, and the plea agreement, approved by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in New Jersey, did not call for prison time.
But on Thursday, Judge Susan Wigenton of U.S. District Court in New Jersey summarily rejected Daibes’ plea.

Why Electric Vehicles Are a Favorite Scapegoat for Republican Candidates: [National Desk]

Full text: The industry's transition to battery power is already underway. Republican presidential candidates are pushing to reverse course.
Fresh off a walking tour of blighted Flint, Mich., on Wednesday, Vivek Ramaswamy spoke excitedly about a comeback for the "forgotten America" that he has made a part of his long-shot bid for the presidency.
He wasn't promising that the automakers that had largely abandoned Flint would return. "We have opportunities, though, to look to the future of a lot that we need to bring to this country," Mr. Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, said, ticking through the industries that he'd like to see help drive a revival: semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, defense production.
The industry he doesn't want involved is the one already pouring money into the state: electric vehicles. He attributes the investments and the rising popularity of the cars to tax credits and favorable regulations that he would reverse as president.
"That's not only a market distortion, but a market distortion that is decidedly a step in an anti-American direction that I think is frankly dangerous to the future of the country," he told reporters just outside Flint.
Mr. Ramaswamy's enmity toward electric cars, extolled in the ancestral home of the American automobile, does not exactly set him apart in the presidential field. The front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald J. Trump, was in Michigan last week, reeling off a rambling bill of particulars against E.V.s, complaining falsely that they run out of power in 15 minutes, are bad for the environment, and would destroy the domestic auto industry within a few short years.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a distant second to Mr. Trump in national polls, recently railed against electric vehicles when he unveiled an energy policy platform that promised to roll back E.V. subsidies to "support Americans' right to drive the cars they want." Mike Pence, Mr. Trump's former vice president-turned-competitor, agrees with Mr. Ramaswamy and others that the transition to electric vehicles would send American auto manufacturing to China.
Opposing electric cars -- and the industry's ongoing shift away from internal-combustion engines to battery power -- allows Republican candidates to criticize China, the dominant economic force in the battery industry. It also pleases G.O.P. voters still hostile to the notion of climate change -- what Mr. Ramaswamy disparaged Wednesday night as "that God-forsaken religion, the climate cult" and "the E.V. subsidy cult" -- and to all things environmental and "woke." And it evokes a nostalgic halcyon past, the same one that Mr. Trump conjured when he promised in 2016 to bring back coal mines, steel mills and basic manufacturing.
But the steel mills and coal mines failed to roar back to their glory days, and the internal-combustion engine is unlikely to as well. In fact, the electric vehicle transition is well underway.
That transition is driven in part by President Biden's policies, which subsidize the manufacturing and purchasing of E.V.s and their components and impose strict fuel economy standards on automakers that can be met with zero-emission electric cars. But it's also motivated by Detroit executives who have vowed to convert their corporations to all electric, by consumers reacting to environmental concerns and gas prices, and by aggressive policies from governments like those of California, Britain and Europe that are beyond the reach of a Republican White House.
Those forces have prompted hundreds of billions of dollars to pour into states like Michigan and Ohio, but also to Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee, to assemble electric vehicles and build batteries and other parts with the warm embrace of Republican governors.
"The free market and consumer demand should drive the automobile manufacturing industry like it has here in Georgia, creating thousands of high-paying E.V. jobs across our state because of Georgia's first-class business environment, unmatched work force and strong logistics network," Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, said in a statement this week. "The path to America leading industrial innovation in the 21st century is through Republican-led states."
But Republican presidential candidates say that, if elected, they will eliminate Mr. Biden's tax incentives to build and buy electric cars and trucks, and roll back his fuel efficiency standards aimed at sharply reducing climate-warming greenhouse gases.
"I support letting people choose the cars that they want without those perverse incentives and the tax code that suggests that buying an electric vehicle is somehow in the owner's best interest," Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said, though such incentives have helped prompt BMW, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz to expand E.V. operations in his state.
The Republican Party's attacks on E.V.s. stem in part from real concerns shared by the auto industry and foreign policymakers. China does dominate battery-making, and as lithium-ion battery imports soar -- they were up 99 percent last year from 2021 -- a weakening Chinese domestic economy is bolstered abroad.
In Green Charter Township, Mich., where Gotion, a Chinese subsidiary, plans to build a battery plant, Mr. Ramaswamy showed up Wednesday evening at a horse farm dotted with signs reading "No Go on Gotion." Alongside promises to "make sure that God-forsaken plant never gets built," he criticized the "electric vehicle subsidy cult," which, he said to cheers, "will end on my watch as your next president."
"If you want to buy an E.V., I'm fine with that -- we don't need to use our taxpayer dollars to subsidize it," Mr. Ramaswamy said, declaring that subsidies involve "subsidizing the C.C.P. because those E.V.s require batteries made in China -- now made by China across the street from here," a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.
And some attendees agreed.
"I don't have a problem with electric vehicles -- if you want one, OK, cool, buy one. But don't force me, because I got a Dodge Ram with a Hemi and I love it," Randy Guppy, from Howard City, Mich., said, referring to a type of V-8 engine.
John Bozzella, president of the auto industry's Alliance for Automotive Innovation, also fretted that the Biden administration's aggressive push for electrification was driving the auto industry faster than suppliers could ramp up battery production, strengthening China's hand -- and possibly opening the domestic market to cheap Chinese electric cars.
And electric vehicles do take fewer workers to assemble than internal-combustion vehicles, driving labor unrest and Democratic political worries.
But the notion that electric vehicles are economically out of reach, technically infeasible and will somehow cripple domestic auto production and shift manufacturing to China appears belied by what is actually happening. This spring, fully electric vehicle sales reached 7.2 percent of all car and light-truck sales, a 48.4 percent increase over the year before and on a trajectory that analysts believe will only accelerate, according to Cox Automotive. U.S. consumers chose from 103 different models of cars, pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and vans.
The automotive industry said the average cost of an E.V. fell this year by $ 10,700, to $ 54,300 -- $ 5,800 more than the overall average cost of cars and light trucks in the country.
Some 77 percent of all E.V.s sold in the United States were produced in North America -- almost 60 percent from Tesla, owned by Republican-friendly Elon Musk. The rest were from Japan, Europe and South Korea. More than 660,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids were sold in the United States in the first half of this year, by the industry's count; only a few thousand were from China, and that number actually declined, according to automotive analysts.
Money is pouring in. Around $ 115 billion has been pledged to build vehicles, batteries and components in the United States, much of that in Michigan and the Southeast. Georgia, a key swing state in 2024, has seen $ 25.1 billion in pledged investment alone, said Garrison Douglas, a spokesman for Governor Kemp.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment in the industry will rise by more than 8.3 million by 2031, and while employment for basic assembly-line workers will decline by 96,000, higher wage jobs in engineering, software development and electronic assembly will shoot upward.
Earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, blocked Ford from considering his state for a new battery factory, saying he was worried that the automaker was being used "as a front for China," which would have controlled much of the plant's technology. Ford then moved its $ 3.5 billion investment to Marshall, Mich.
Stacey LaRouche, a spokeswoman for Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's Democratic governor, talked up such investment on Wednesday, as Toyota and LG Energy Systems were announcing a $ 3 billion expansion of LG's battery plant in Holland, Mich., to power Toyota E.V.s built in Kentucky.
Electric vehicle and battery deals, she said, "are creating thousands of good paying jobs right here in Michigan, not overseas."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The scrutiny could create fresh legal and political peril for Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, who has been charged with accepting bribes.
The New Jersey attorney general's office seized records on Thursday from Bergen County law enforcement agencies to review whether the investigation of a fatal 2018 car crash involving the soon-to-be wife of Senator Robert Menendez was handled properly, two officials said.
Nadine Menendez, who was dating Mr. Menendez at the time of the crash, was released by the police without a summons or a sobriety test after she struck and killed Richard Koop, 49, while driving at night along a wide, two-lane boulevard in Bogota, N.J., police records show.
After a brief investigation, the police determined that Ms. Menendez, 56, was "not at fault" and that Mr. Koop, who had marijuana and alcohol in his system, had been jaywalking as he walked across the street toward his apartment. Ms. Menendez told officers that Mr. Koop "jumped on my windshield"; no charges were filed.
The attorney general's office began its inquiry a day after details of the collision were reported publicly for the first time by The New York Times and The Record of New Jersey, nearly five years after it happened. A review by The Times of police reports, dashcam footage, 911 call recordings and a video of the collision raises new questions about the rigor of an investigation that Mr. Koop's relatives have long believed was inadequate.
The renewed scrutiny could create fresh legal and political peril for Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, and his wife, who were indicted last month alongside three New Jersey businessmen in a brazen bribery scheme. They have each pleaded not guilty, including to an allegation that they received as a bribe a new Mercedes-Benz convertible to replace Ms. Menendez's car that was damaged in the crash.
The investigation began as new details of the case emerged.
On Friday, a friend told The Times that at the time of the crash, Ms. Menendez had been driving to meet a group of people for dinner, including a former top Hackensack police official, Michael Mordaga. The friend said Mr. Mordaga was the unnamed former officer who can be heard on a dashcam video talking with the Bogota police who investigated the crash.
The attorney general's public integrity unit will review all records generated by the Bogota Police Department and the Bergen County Prosecutor's office to determine if the investigation into the fatal crash was handled appropriately, according to the two officials, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. New Jersey's attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, has authority over all police agencies and county prosecutors' offices in the state. His investigation was first reported by NBC News.
Leaders of the Bogota Police Department have not returned phone calls or responded to in-person queries about the incident for days. On Thursday, an officer, Kevin Geraghty, referred a reporter to the borough attorney, William Betesh, who said he had "no comment in this matter."
Christopher M. Kelemen, the borough's Republican mayor, and every member of Bogota's elected council declined to comment, citing a directive from Mr. Betesh. Several members of the council said they had been unaware of the crash or the high-profile driver involved until this week -- even though state records show it was the small borough's only traffic fatality in at least a 10-year period.
Elizabeth Rebein, a spokeswoman for the Bergen County Prosecutor's office, said she had no information to provide about the seizure of records or the attorney general's review.
The issue briefly burst into the open at a town meeting in Bogota Thursday night when Jorge Nunez, a former council member, spoke up to say he wanted to know more about the police response. "I'm not the only one to not feel good about my community, our community," he said.
Neither Mr. Menendez nor his wife had ever reached out to the Koop family to express condolences. Ms. Menendez's lawyer, David Schertler, called Mr. Koop's death a "tragic accident," but said Ms. Menendez "was not at fault, did not violate any laws and was therefore not charged with any crimes."
"We are confident that any 'reopening' of an investigation into the accident will confirm that conclusion," Mr. Schertler added in an email on Friday.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan last month charged the senator and his wife in a wide-ranging 39-page indictment. Prosecutors said the couple accepted bribes including bars of gold bullion and mortgage payments in exchange for Mr. Menendez's using his political clout to stifle criminal investigations and to steer aid and weapons to Egypt.
Though they did not share details of the fatal December 2018 collision, prosecutors said in the indictment that Ms. Menendez had been in an "accident" that month that left her without a car. They said that the senator then agreed to try to halt a state criminal investigation tied to an associate in exchange for a $ 60,000 Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible.
Mr. Platkin's office had previously announced it would investigate the senator's alleged effort to interfere with the state investigation. That review will be expanded to include a review of the fatal crash that preceded it.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Platkin had no comment about the inquiry.
Ms. Menendez's car struck Mr. Koop as he was walking toward his home after being dropped off on the opposite side of the street, according to his relatives and police records. His body was thrown toward the curb by the impact. Both of his shoes flew off, one landing in the center of the street and the other on the sidewalk in front of his apartment. By the time the police arrived, he had no pulse.
A passer-by placed the first 911 call. Ms. Menendez called the police four minutes after the crash, telling a 911 dispatcher that Mr. Koop had jumped onto her car, an explanation she repeated to a Bogota officer investigating the crash.
At some point, Ms. Menendez apparently called a friend, Rosemarie Sorce, the well-connected wife of a New Jersey developer and a prolific donor to Mr. Menendez's Senate campaigns.
In a statement to The Times, Ms. Sorce said her husband had invited Mr. Mordaga, a close family friend, to dinner that night with Ms. Menendez at I Gemelli, a restaurant in South Hackensack. The three of them drove to the accident scene in Bogota after Ms. Menendez called her about the crash.
Mr. Mordaga, who served as chief of detectives for the Bergen County Prosecutor's office and as the police director in Hackensack, can be heard on a police recording identifying himself as a retired officer and asking whether the police planned to involve the prosecutors.
"I don't even know her," he says in the recording. "That's my buddy's wife who's friends with her. He said could you do me a favor and take her up there, because her friend just got in a car accident."
Ms. Sorce said that she did not believe Mr. Mordaga and Ms. Menendez had ever met, even though they were to have dinner together that night.
"Nadine was very upset and distraught, but she was not intoxicated or impaired in any way," Ms. Sorce said. She asserted that Ms. Menendez did not know that night that Mr. Koop, whose body lay badly mangled just feet from her car, had died.
The group, including Ms. Menendez, later continued on to the restaurant, where Ms. Sorce said she remembered ordering some food before Mr. Mordaga drove Ms. Menendez home.
Mr. Mordaga did not return repeated requests for comment.
Senator Menendez was in Washington the night of the collision. It remains unclear whether Ms. Menendez called him.
Mr. Koop's death has been the only motor-vehicle fatality in Bogota, a small suburban borough of about 8,000 people near the Hackensack River, since 2013, according to state data. It was one of 19 pedestrian fatalities in Bergen County in 2018, a figure that has fluctuated only slightly in recent years, according to state data. Driving while intoxicated was a factor in nearly one-third of the 524 fatal car crashes in New Jersey that year.
Police officers, who must have probable cause to test a driver for alcohol, did not test Ms. Menendez, even though days after the crash, police investigators still sought to prove Mr. Koop had been drinking that night.
State records show that a majority of surviving drivers involved in fatal crashes are not tested for alcohol. Only 30 percent of surviving drivers were tested in 2018, while most pedestrians killed, 154 out of 175, were tested for alcohol, presumably through autopsies.
The Bogota police report largely relies on Ms. Menendez's account of what happened. In it, police officers note that they briefly asked to see her phone, but that she quickly asked for it back. The report does not indicate whether they asked if she had been distracted or was speeding, or otherwise tried to verify that she was following the law.
Also on Thursday, in a sign of the complicated and interwoven nature of the charges Mr. Menendez faces, a federal judge rejected a guilty plea that one of the senator's co-defendants, Fred Daibes, made over a year ago in an unrelated bank fraud case.
Mr. Daibes, a New Jersey developer who was accused last month of giving the senator and his wife bribes, had pleaded guilty to making false entries in connection with a loan document. The $ 1.8 million loan was paid back, and the plea agreement, approved by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, did not call for prison time.
But on Thursday, Judge Susan D. Wigenton of U.S. District Court in New Jersey summarily rejected Mr. Daibes's plea.

BOGOTA, N.J. — It was a cold evening in December 2018, and Nadine Arslanian, the soon-to-be wife of Sen. Bob Menendez, was zipping through the darkened streets of suburban New Jersey in a black Mercedes-Benz sedan. She would later tell police she did not see the man stepping out in front of her to cross a busy thoroughfare.
The crash that ensued just after 7:30 p.m. killed the man, Richard Koop, 49, almost instantly. His body was thrown to the curb just steps from his home and badly mangled, according to the Bergen County medical examiner.
After brief questioning, police concluded that Arslanian, who was alone in the vehicle, was “not at fault.” She was released without a summons.
What happened that night in the borough of Bogota outside New York City was not reported for years, leaving witnesses and Koop’s family to wonder if the fatal collision was deliberately kept quiet. But now, nearly five years later, the episode adds a startling dimension to a scandal that has shaken American politics and raised new questions about the senator at its center.
The revelation helps fill in an important narrative gap around one of the most blatant bribes alleged in a 39-page federal indictment unveiled last month against Nadine Menendez, her powerful husband and three businesspeople.
Prosecutors said in those charging papers that Nadine Menendez needed a car so badly after a December 2018 “accident” that the senator, a Democrat, was willing to try to suppress an unrelated criminal prosecution for a New Jersey businessperson in exchange for a $60,000 Mercedes convertible. The fatal collision with Koop on Dec. 12 matches prosecutors’ terse description of the December 2018 crash.
Interviews, police reports, dashcam footage, audio of 911 calls and other records reviewed by The New York Times also raise additional questions about the inquiry into the collision itself, which was reported earlier Wednesday by The Record of New Jersey. The questions include whether Bob Menendez, a senator long accused of using the levers of government to help his friends, may have made an attempt to intervene.
There were reasons for suspicion at the time. One witness at the scene said in an interview that officers appeared to know who Nadine Menendez was and treated her with striking deference. Police recordings captured the voice of a man who identifies himself as a retired police officer from a nearby department. He can be heard saying he came to the scene as “a favor” to a friend whose wife knew Nadine Menendez.
The police reports indicate she was never tested for drugs or alcohol, and was allowed to leave the scene, not long before Koop was declared dead at a nearby hospital. Three days later, police investigators were sent to local bars to get more information on where Koop had been in the hours before his death.
Koop’s sister, Rosemarie Koop-Angelicola, said the family never heard a word from Nadine Menendez or the senator after the crash, and little from local authorities.
“The family really has had serious concerns over what we felt was a very sparse, one-sided investigation,” Koop-Angelicola said in an interview. “Definitely a lack of legal enthusiasm to take this case, definite lack of media coverage, and a lack of communication by the authorities of Bergen County. We felt that the whole thing was very silently swept under the rug.”
The senator, 69, and Nadine Menendez, 56, have each pleaded not guilty to the bribery-related charges, and the senator insists prosecutors are twisting facts to make legitimate congressional activity look nefarious.
In an interview, David Schertler, a lawyer for Nadine Menendez, called the car crash a “tragic accident” but one that was unrelated to the charges she is currently facing.
“My understanding was this individual ran in front of her car, and she was not at fault,” Schertler said.
Bob Menendez used almost identical language in comments to reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday afternoon, after the crash was reported. “Obviously we think of the family,” he added.
Officers from the Bogota Police Department did not return a string of calls that began Friday seeking comments about the case.
A spokesperson for the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office, which would have been responsible for any decision to charge Nadine Menendez, said that by the time a special unit from the office arrived at the scene, local police had already determined “that no criminality was suspected to be involved.”
‘Congratulations Mon Amour de la Vie’
Bob and Nadine Menendez had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for much of 2018. He was a divorced, high-ranking senator reelected for a third term that November. She was also divorced, socially outgoing and 13 years his junior.
People close to Bob Menendez had encouraged him to walk away, concerned that Nadine Menendez — unemployed and fond of flashy jewelry and designer shoes, with a mysterious circle of friends — had Champagne taste on a beer budget, according to three people familiar with the conversations, who did not want to be identified because the discussions were private.
But by December, the couple’s bond appeared to be growing stronger. According to prosecutors, Nadine Menendez had already introduced her future husband to an Egyptian American friend she had known for nearly a decade, Wael Hana. She helped organize a series of dinners and meetings that prosecutors say formed the beginning of a corrupt scheme to use the senator’s power to improperly help the Egyptian government in return for bribes.
They would soon have reason to call upon those connections again.
Police reports do not state where Nadine Menendez was going the night she struck Koop on East Main Street in Bogota, miles from her home in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. But dashcam footage obtained by the Times through an open records request shows she was dressed in a fur coat and mid-length dress.
Koop was coming home from an evening at nearby bars. Family members said he took an Uber home that night that dropped him across the street from his apartment, moments before he was struck.
Surveillance video from a nearby car shop that captured part of the collision shows Koop propelled off Menendez’s car and onto the curb as she slammed on the brakes.
The crash badly damaged Menendez’s car. “Her front windshield was shattered and had front-end damage on the passenger side, which was later determined to be from a parked car that she struck after striking Mr. Koop,” a Bogota police sergeant wrote in an incident report later.
The senator was away in Washington that night, according to Senate voting records. But after Christmas, he accompanied Nadine Menendez to a towing company’s lot to collect her belongings from the car, a company official told the Times.
He would also prove integral to replacing it, prosecutors said.
In the indictment, they mention nothing more about the collision than that it “left her without a car.” But court papers clarify what prosecutors allege came next.
They said Nadine Menendez sent multiple text messages to Hana complaining she did not have a car. But two friends, Bob Menendez and another New Jersey businessperson who was close to Hana, Jose Uribe, soon agreed to terms to rectify that.
According to the indictment, Bob Menendez agreed to call a senior prosecutor at the New Jersey attorney general’s office in late January to try to pressure him to go easy on an associate of Uribe. Uribe, in return, agreed to finance a car, prosecutors said. His lawyer did not return requests for comment.
“All is GREAT! I’m so excited to get a car next week. !!” Nadine Menendez texted Hana a few days after the senator placed the call.
In April, four months after Koop’s death, Nadine Menendez signed paperwork to purchase a new $60,000 Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible. She told Uribe by text that she would “never forget this” and messaged Bob Menendez to celebrate, too.
“Congratulations mon amour de la vie,” Nadine Menendez wrote to Bob Menendez, according to the indictment. “We are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes.”
‘A Lot of Secrecy’
There is nothing explicitly noted in police incident reports or the videos reviewed by the Times to indicate that officers knew of the driver’s relationship with the senator.
But Sergio Uribe, who owned the parked car Menendez hit after Koop, recalled hearing the driver repeatedly telling officers she was going to call someone as they secured the scene that night.
He said he did not know Nadine Menendez’s identity at the time but suspected she was “someone important.” (Sergio Uribe is not related to Jose Uribe.)
“I don’t know if she was well known, or lived nearby, or the police knew her, but there appeared to be a lot of secrecy,” he said in an interview in Spanish. “I remember saying, ‘That woman is just allowed to leave? She’s not being arrested or anything?’”
Surveillance video shows that Menendez stayed in her car after striking Koop, eventually moving the vehicle a few car lengths in front of where his body came to rest.
She called 911 a little more than four minutes after the collision. “Some guy just jumped in front of my car,” Menendez told a dispatcher in a shaky voice, according to a recording of the call shared by the Koop family’s lawyer, Sheri Breen. By then, officers were already arriving on the scene, where they found Koop had no pulse.
Menendez appears to have made at least one other call, too. Within roughly 30 minutes of the collision, a man who identified himself to police as a retired officer from nearby Hackensack, New Jersey, arrived to help her.
“I don’t even know her,” the man can be heard saying. “That’s my buddy’s wife who’s friends with her. He said could you do me a favor and take her up there, because her friend just got in a car accident.”
The former officer is not identified by name, but he later asks Bogota police if prosecutors will need to be involved. They indicate they are preparing to release her. “Why was the guy in the middle of the street?,” Menendez can be heard asking an officer in the same video, before repeating “he jumped on my windshield.”
“It is determined that at this time Ms. Arslanian was not at fault for the motor vehicle crash and that Mr. Koop was jaywalking,” the Bogota sergeant wrote in his report the next day.
The autopsy report would later show that Koop had alcohol and marijuana in his system. His family said it had never understood why Menendez was not tested for substances, too.
“The dead man was drug- and alcohol-tested, but the driver wasn’t,” Koop-Angelicola said. “Things like that just don’t play fair in our mind.”
But veteran criminal defense lawyers said it was not unusual for police not to test Menendez for alcohol or other substances the night of the crash.
Joseph D. Rotella, a past president of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, said authorities must demonstrate probable cause that a driver was impaired before testing for alcohol immediately after the crash, even in the case of a pedestrian fatality.
Often, in the hours after a fatal car accident, county prosecutors will seek a warrant to test the driver’s blood. But unless investigators have demonstrated probable cause, judges can and do deny warrants, said Rotella, who has been a criminal defense lawyer for 37 years in New Jersey.
“Sometimes accidents are just accidents — nothing more,” he said.
A patrol officer on the scene did ask to search Menendez’s cellphone. She initially consented but quickly asked for it back, he wrote in his account. At one point, she indicated she would not answer additional questions without a lawyer present.
A police report later indicated that authorities issued a subpoena for Menendez’s phone records — presumably to see if she had been calling or texting at the time of the accident — but it does not indicate what the search yielded or if it was even completed.
The episode left Koop’s family and friends devastated.
He was divorced at the time he died but devoted to his son. Koop-Angelicola described him as a “small-town guy”: an avid fisherman, enthusiastic coach and a regular at the local bars. He had worked for years at the Javits Center in New York City, but his employment was spottier in later years.
“Nothing too complicated on how he lived his life,” she said. “Very, very unpretentious person.”
Friends of Koop’s from the Westside Village Tavern in Ridgefield Park, a small bar about 1 mile from his apartment, attached a plaque in his memory to his favorite bar stool after the crash. They have kept his Quick Draw lottery numbers stored behind the bar in the “Bartender’s Bible,” a drink recipe book.
Veronica Valandingham, the tavern’s manager and bartender at the time when Koop died, said she was interviewed by police, who were trying to retrace his steps on Dec. 12. She said she did not get the impression they were trying to prove anything in particular but just understand where he had been the day he died.
“The thing that got everybody was he was trying to do the right thing and take an Uber and then this happens,” she said.
Danielle DeBouter, Koop’s ex-wife, was called to identify his body hours later. She said he was almost unrecognizable. She only learned of the connection between Nadine Menendez and the senator later, through Breen.
“We always wondered what actually happened that horrible night. So much was left unanswered,” DeBouter said. “I don’t know if we will ever know the truth.”

Full text: After emigrating to New Jersey from Egypt, Wael Hana faced a string of business and legal problems. Then his friend started dating a powerful U.S. senator.
Just five years ago, Wael Hana was reeling from a string of bad business deals in New Jersey, having tried to launch a truck stop, an Italian restaurant, a limousine service and other companies without ever hitting it big.
Then, his friend started dating Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of the most powerful Democrats in the United States Senate. Soon, Mr. Hana introduced Mr. Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to a growing circle of Egyptian officials, and Mr. Hana's fortunes took a remarkable turn: He won sole control over certifying all halal food being imported into Egypt, earning enough money to bribe Mr. Menendez with gold bars and wads of cash, prosecutors said.
Mr. Hana, Mr. Menendez and others are now facing charges in what prosecutors have described as a wide-ranging corruption scheme -- one that threatens to put an end to the senator's five decades in politics. But the allegations, if true, also raise a pressing question about Mr. Hana: Was he an agent of the Egyptian government all along, or just a lucky opportunist who stumbled into a position of international influence?
The F.B.I. is investigating this very question. But a New York Times examination of hundreds of pages of court filings, business records and interviews with nearly a dozen people who knew or dealt with Mr. Hana offered insights into the path he traveled during his bumpy start -- and meteoric rise.
Within the span of a few years, he would transform from a debt-laden businessman who could not afford even a $ 2,000 emergency room bill to an international power broker who boasted about his Rolex watch collection to a diplomat in Cairo.
In addition to the corruption investigation into Mr. Menendez, the F.B.I. has been conducting a parallel counterintelligence inquiry, according to four people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation. The review, first reported by NBC News, is seeking to determine whether Egypt's intelligence service sought to obtain information from Mr. Menendez through Mr. Hana's friend Nadine Menendez, who married Mr. Menendez in 2020.
Federal agents are also seeking to determine Mr. Hana's relationship with Egyptian intelligence agencies and when that relationship may have started, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Hana said in a statement that he was innocent of all charges and that he has cooperated with federal prosecutors by providing them "unfettered access to documents and to his employees." She added that he voluntarily booked a flight to New York from Egypt "within minutes of learning about this indictment," leaving his wife and three young daughters behind.
"Wael Hana's background is a classic immigrant story," the spokeswoman said. "He has been an entrepreneur who has built several businesses, and he has always acted ethically and legally."
Mr. Hana, an American citizen, has been on law enforcement's radar for at least four years. In November 2019, the F.B.I. raided his home and office in New Jersey with a search warrant indicating prosecutors were gathering evidence of potential crimes, including illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government, according to a court filing.
However, Mr. Hana, 40, was not charged with that offense. In the indictment unsealed this September, prosecutors said he was the broker who helped to orchestrate an agreement for Mr. Menendez to steer more American aid and weapons to Egypt. Mr. Menendez is also accused of sending sensitive information about U.S. Embassy employees in Cairo to his wife, who forwarded it to Mr. Hana, who sent it on to an Egyptian government official.
In return, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana and his circle of business associates showered the Menendezes with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars, and bribes that included a mortgage payment for Ms. Menendez, a "low-or-no-show" job for her at Mr. Hana's halal company and a new Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Mr. Hana, the Menendezes and the others charged in the case have pleaded not guilty. Last week, Mr. Menendez rebuffed calls for his resignation and predicted he would be exonerated.
In August, a month before their arrest, Mr. Menendez and his wife traveled to Egypt, where the senator met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The Egyptian government has not commented publicly. On YouTube, some pro-government influencers praised the facts of the investigation, saying that it showed how Egypt was doing a good job of protecting its own interests.
A humble beginning
Mr. Hana was 22 when he arrived in the United States through the visa lottery system in 2006, a few years after the death of his father, according to a person familiar with Mr. Hana's background. He started working for a cleaning company and enrolled in English language classes at a community college, the person said.
Right away, he showed an entrepreneurial hustle, creating a trucking business called Elmanhry LLC -- the first in a long list of businesses that would appear under his name.
He bought a home in Bayonne, N.J., for $ 450,000 from a seller who attended the same Egyptian church as he did, the seller said. He appeared to buy the home without a down payment, securing a mortgage for the full purchase price, property records show.
By 2011, Mr. Hana had moved on to the luxury car business, and he approached a Chinese businessman with a proposal. Mr. Hana would negotiate with Porsche and Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Jersey to purchase new cars on behalf of the businessman, who would then sell them to customers in China. They hashed out the details over dinner at a seafood restaurant in Flushing, Queens, according to court records.
But after the businessman's company, Bosto New York, wired $ 3.6 million to Mr. Hana and his partners, they provided only $ 2.9 million worth of cars, the businessman said in a lawsuit filed in 2012.
Bosto New York won a judgment against Mr. Hana and his partners for the missing $ 705,000, but Mr. Hana never appeared in court or paid off what he owed, records show.
Soon, Mr. Hana's legal troubles began to snowball. He was accused in lawsuits of writing bad checks, among other things, eventually racking up a total of at least $ 890,000 in judgments, court records show.
In 2014, Mr. Hana was charged with driving while intoxicated after police officers said they found him passed out in the driver's seat of a parked car in Oradell, N.J. When Mr. Hana was taken to the hospital, the police said he threatened them several times, according to a local police blotter.
The lawyer who represented him in court, Andy Aslanian, would eventually introduce Mr. Hana to the tangled web of friends and business associates that would give rise to the indictment against Mr. Menendez.
In interviews, Mr. Aslanian said he took Mr. Hana under his wing after learning that Mr. Hana was alone in the country. At one point, Mr. Aslanian shared his office space with him, and they spent some holiday dinners together.
"I considered him my No. 1 son," Mr. Aslanian said of Mr. Hana.
At that time, Mr. Aslanian had cause for concern. A hospital had sued Mr. Hana in 2017 for thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills. And he had missed years of mortgage payments and taxes, according to court records, ultimately resulting in the loss of his Bayonne home to foreclosure in 2018.
Although he struggled financially in the United States, Mr. Hana appeared to have a close tie with the government in Egypt.
He recommended Mr. Aslanian for a job representing Egypt in a 2016 zoning dispute over a building -- intended as a residence for Egyptian military representatives and their families -- in East Rutherford, N.J., Mr. Aslanian told The Record, a newspaper in Bergen County.
Mr. Aslanian, who met Mr. Hana around 2009 and introduced him to the future Ms. Menendez, Nadine Arslanian, soon after, also made other connections for Mr. Hana. Mr. Aslanian said the three of them would often hang out after work at a French restaurant owned by the developer Fred Daibes -- who would also be charged in the corruption case alongside Mr. Hana and the Menendezes.
In November 2017, Mr. Aslanian and Mr. Hana created a company called IS EG Halal, whose purpose was to certify meat as halal, or prepared in adherence with Islamic law. Mr. Daibes would lend financial backing to the project.
Three months later, according to the indictment, their friend Nadine began dating Mr. Menendez.
A sudden rise
Douglas Anton first met Mr. Hana in 2017 through Ms. Menendez, who was dating Mr. Anton at the time. She introduced Mr. Hana as someone who was a relative of "somebody high up in the Egyptian government," Mr. Anton recalled.
Mr. Anton was never quite sure what Mr. Hana did for work, other than that "he was some kind of liaison with Egypt," Mr. Anton said.
Behind the scenes, according to prosecutors, Mr. Hana was texting directly with Egyptian military and government officials. Throughout 2018, Mr. Hana was busy setting up meetings to introduce them to Mr. Menendez. The senator began to use his position to benefit Egypt's interests, the indictment said, including by ghostwriting a letter for an Egyptian official who was trying to persuade other U.S. senators to release a hold on $ 300 million in military aid to Egypt.
Mr. Hana's efforts came as Egyptian officials were aggressively lobbying members of Congress to lift restrictions on the aid, which lawmakers imposed in response to the government's poor human rights record. Officials in Cairo viewed the restrictions as an affront to a nation that has been a partner to the United States on counterterrorism, trade and regional security for years.
Mr. Hana's connections paid off handsomely in the spring of 2019.
The Egyptian government abruptly awarded his company, IS EG Halal, the exclusive right to certify all American food imported into Egypt as halal, prosecutors said.
The decision caused concern throughout the industry. Mr. Hana, a Christian, had no experience in halal certification. By his own admission, the company was not even operating until it was awarded the monopoly.
In a court filing in 2020, Mr. Hana explained that he won the approval because the Egyptian government wanted to take any halal certification power away from the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that Egypt has vilified as a terrorist group, to deprive it of financial resources.
Because he had no expertise in Islamic law, Mr. Hana wrote, the Egyptian government provided him with imams and veterinarians to train him.
Before securing the monopoly, Mr. Hana wrote, he had another company that was already shipping goods into Egypt on the government's behalf, taking bid requests from the Egyptian Ministry of Defense's office in Washington. Mr. Hana said he was also in the process of starting another company that would handle the shipping of everything sold by the U.S. Army to Egypt.
Mr. Menendez would later be accused by prosecutors of calling a high-level official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop the U.S.D.A. from interfering with Mr. Hana's import business, which had raised prices for meat suppliers worldwide. Previously, the certification in the United States had been performed by a handful of companies.
Prosecutors allege that the senator was motivated to help Mr. Hana because Mr. Hana was using his halal company to wire bribe money to Ms. Menendez.
After the monopoly, Mr. Hana was living large. The company was headquartered in Edgewater, N.J., down the street from Mr. Hana's new luxury apartment overlooking the Hudson River, in a building owned by the family of Mr. Daibes.
The man who had just lost his home to foreclosure now had enough money to help his friends with their mortgages. In July 2019, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana used his halal company to pay about $ 23,000 to bring Ms. Menendez current on her mortgage during her own foreclosure proceedings.
But soon, an F.B.I. raid threatened to torpedo it all. In November 2019, federal agents searched Mr. Hana's home and office, seizing electronic devices, papers, notepads, a photo album and even a gold cigarette.
During the search, federal agents questioned Mr. Hana about contacts he had in Egypt, including with an embassy employee, Mr. Hana said in a court filing. He said his entire family lived in Egypt.
Federal agents also discovered that Mr. Hana's cellphone contained thousands of text messages with Ms. Menendez, prosecutors later said.
After a few months, with no criminal charges in sight, Mr. Hana asked the prosecutors to return his belongings. Among the seized items were a chain he bought in Italy, two Rolex watches that he said were gifts and a pair of earrings he said he designed for his mother that were worth about $ 15,000.
"I do not understand why the government would take my jewelry, which I would like to wear," he wrote in a court filing. It was unclear whether he got his jewelry back.
Under indictment
By 2020, federal officials said Mr. Hana's halal company had essentially become an Egyptian state entity, winning an expanded monopoly to control the certification process for all food and beverages shipped to Egypt from anywhere in the world.
As his business prospered, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana made time to ensure that Ms. Menendez was placated. In June 2021, he bought 22 gold bars with unique serial numbers, valued at a total of about $ 40,000, according to prosecutors. Two of the gold bars were later found in the Menendez home by federal agents, prosecutors said.
The rapid expansion of his business led Mr. Hana to travel frequently, opening offices in Uruguay, India, Brazil, Egypt and New Zealand. Photos posted on the internet show him meeting with ambassadors and dignitaries around the world to discuss trade with Egypt.
Last year, Mr. Hana made a memorable impression on one former Western diplomat in Cairo. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Hana was an hour late to their lunch with no explanation or apology. They discussed the halal certification process, and Mr. Hana mentioned countries that were complaining about the prices he was charging.
The diplomat thought Mr. Hana was such a character that he wrote about it in his diary: He was "wearing an absurdly expensive suit, gold Rolex, gold rings. Spoke confidently, but softly, so you had to really listen."
"In our second lunch," he added, "he spent about twenty minutes telling me about his Rolex collection."
After he was indicted, it was a decidedly less flashy Mr. Hana who appeared before a judge in Federal District Court in Manhattan this past week, dressed in a baggy blue shirt and slacks.
He was released the same day after securing a $ 5 million bond -- and agreeing to wear a GPS monitoring device.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Just five years ago, Wael Hana was reeling from a string of bad business deals in New Jersey, having tried to launch a truck stop, an Italian restaurant, a limousine service and other companies without ever hitting it big.
Then, his friend started dating Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, one of the most powerful Democrats in the U.S. Senate. Soon, Hana introduced Menendez, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to a growing circle of Egyptian officials, and Hana’s fortunes took a remarkable turn: He won sole control over certifying all halal food being imported into Egypt, earning enough money to bribe Menendez with gold bars and wads of cash, prosecutors said.
Hana, Menendez and others are now facing charges in what prosecutors have described as a wide-ranging corruption scheme — one that threatens to put an end to the senator’s five decades in politics. But the allegations, if true, also raise a pressing question about Hana: Was he an agent of the Egyptian government all along, or just a lucky opportunist who stumbled into a position of international influence?
The FBI is investigating this very question. But a New York Times examination of hundreds of pages of court filings, business records and interviews with nearly a dozen people who knew or dealt with Hana offered insights into the path he traveled during his bumpy start — and meteoric rise.
Within the span of a few years, he would transform from a debt-laden business owner who could not afford even a $2,000 emergency room bill to an international power broker who boasted about his Rolex watch collection to a diplomat in Cairo.
In addition to the corruption investigation into Menendez, the FBI has been conducting a parallel counterintelligence inquiry, according to four people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation. The review, first reported by NBC News, is seeking to determine whether Egypt’s intelligence service sought to obtain information from Menendez through Hana’s friend Nadine Menendez, who married Bob Menendez in 2020.
Federal agents are also seeking to determine Hana’s relationship with Egyptian intelligence agencies and when that relationship may have started, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
A spokesperson for Hana said in a statement that he was innocent of all charges and that he has cooperated with federal prosecutors by providing them “unfettered access to documents and to his employees.” She added that he voluntarily booked a flight to New York from Egypt “within minutes of learning about this indictment,” leaving his wife and three young daughters behind.
“Wael Hana’s background is a classic immigrant story,” the spokesperson said. “He has been an entrepreneur who has built several businesses, and he has always acted ethically and legally.”
Hana, an American citizen, has been on law enforcement’s radar for at least four years. In November 2019, the FBI raided his home and office in New Jersey with a search warrant indicating prosecutors were gathering evidence of potential crimes, including illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government, according to a court filing.
However, Hana, 40, was not charged with that offense. In the indictment unsealed in September, prosecutors said he was the broker who helped to orchestrate an agreement for Menendez to steer more U.S. aid and weapons to Egypt. Menendez is also accused of sending sensitive information about U.S. Embassy employees in Cairo to his wife, who forwarded it to Hana, who sent it on to an Egyptian government official.
In return, prosecutors said, Hana and his circle of business associates showered the Menendezes with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars, and bribes that included a mortgage payment for Nadine Menendez, a “low-or-no-show” job for her at Hana’s halal company and a new Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Hana, the Menendezes and the others charged in the case have pleaded not guilty. Last week, Bob Menendez rebuffed calls for his resignation and predicted he would be exonerated.
In August, a month before their arrest, Menendez and his wife traveled to Egypt, where the senator met with President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The Egyptian government has not commented publicly. On YouTube, some pro-government influencers praised the facts of the investigation, saying that it showed how Egypt was doing a good job of protecting its own interests.
A Humble Beginning
Hana was 22 when he arrived in the United States through the visa lottery system in 2006, a few years after the death of his father, according to a person familiar with Hana’s background. He started working for a cleaning company and enrolled in English language classes at a community college, the person said.
Right away, he showed an entrepreneurial hustle, creating a trucking business called Elmanhry LLC — the first in a long list of businesses that would appear under his name.
He bought a home in Bayonne, New Jersey, for $450,000 from a seller who attended the same Egyptian church as he did, the seller said. He appeared to buy the home without a down payment, securing a mortgage for the full purchase price, property records show.
By 2011, Hana had moved on to the luxury car business, and he approached a Chinese business owner with a proposal. Hana would negotiate with Porsche and Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Jersey to purchase new cars on behalf of the business owner, who would then sell them to customers in China. They hashed out the details over dinner at a seafood restaurant in the Queens borough of New York City, according to court records.
But after the business owner’s company, Bosto New York, wired $3.6 million to Hana and his partners, they provided only $2.9 million worth of cars, the business owner said in a lawsuit filed in 2012.
Bosto New York won a judgment against Hana and his partners for the missing $705,000, but Hana never appeared in court or paid off what he owed, records show.
Soon, Hana’s legal troubles began to snowball. He was accused in lawsuits of writing bad checks, among other things, eventually racking up a total of at least $890,000 in judgments, court records show.
In 2014, Hana was charged with driving while intoxicated after police officers said they found him passed out in the driver’s seat of a parked car in Oradell, New Jersey. When Hana was taken to the hospital, the police said he threatened them several times, according to a local police blotter.
The lawyer who represented him in court, Andy Aslanian, would eventually introduce Hana to the tangled web of friends and business associates that would give rise to the indictment against Menendez.
In interviews, Aslanian said he took Hana under his wing after learning that Hana was alone in the country. At one point, Aslanian shared his office space with him, and they spent some holiday dinners together.
“I considered him my No. 1 son,” Aslanian said of Hana.
At that time, Aslanian had cause for concern. A hospital had sued Hana in 2017 for thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills. And he had missed years of mortgage payments and taxes, according to court records, ultimately resulting in the loss of his Bayonne home to foreclosure in 2018.
Although he struggled financially in the United States, Hana appeared to have a close tie with the government in Egypt.
He recommended Aslanian for a job representing Egypt in a 2016 zoning dispute over a building — intended as a residence for Egyptian military representatives and their families — in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Aslanian told The Record, a newspaper in Bergen County.
Aslanian, who met Hana around 2009 and introduced him to the future Mrs. Menendez, Nadine Arslanian, soon after, also made other connections for Hana. Aslanian said the three of them would often hang out after work at a French restaurant owned by developer Fred Daibes — who would also be charged in the corruption case alongside Hana and the Menendezes.
In November 2017, Aslanian and Hana created a company called IS EG Halal, whose purpose was to certify meat as halal, or prepared in adherence with Islamic law. Daibes would lend financial backing to the project.
Three months later, according to the indictment, their friend Nadine began dating Bob Menendez.
A Sudden Rise
Douglas Anton first met Hana in 2017 through Nadine Menendez, who was dating Anton at the time. She introduced Hana as someone who was a relative of “somebody high up in the Egyptian government,” Anton recalled.
Anton was never quite sure what Hana did for work, other than that “he was some kind of liaison with Egypt,” Anton said.
Behind the scenes, according to prosecutors, Hana was texting directly with Egyptian military and government officials. Throughout 2018, Hana was busy setting up meetings to introduce them to Bob Menendez. The senator began to use his position to benefit Egypt’s interests, the indictment said, including by ghostwriting a letter for an Egyptian official who was trying to persuade other U.S. senators to release a hold on $300 million in military aid to Egypt.
Hana’s efforts came as Egyptian officials were aggressively lobbying members of Congress to lift restrictions on the aid, which lawmakers imposed in response to the government’s poor human rights record. Officials in Cairo viewed the restrictions as an affront to a nation that has been a partner to the United States on counterterrorism, trade and regional security for years.
Hana’s connections paid off handsomely in the spring of 2019.
The Egyptian government abruptly awarded his company, IS EG Halal, the exclusive right to certify all American food imported into Egypt as halal, prosecutors said.
The decision caused concern throughout the industry. Hana, a Christian, had no experience in halal certification. By his own admission, the company was not even operating until it was awarded the monopoly.
In a court filing in 2020, Hana explained that he won the approval because the Egyptian government wanted to take any halal certification power away from the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that Egypt has vilified as a terrorist group, to deprive it of financial resources.
Because he had no expertise in Islamic law, Hana wrote, the Egyptian government provided him with imams and veterinarians to train him.
Before securing the monopoly, Hana wrote, he had another company that was already shipping goods into Egypt on the government’s behalf, taking bid requests from the Egyptian Ministry of Defense’s office in Washington. Hana said he was also in the process of starting another company that would handle the shipping of everything sold by the U.S. Army to Egypt.
Menendez would later be accused by prosecutors of calling a high-level official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop the USDA from interfering with Hana’s import business, which had raised prices for meat suppliers worldwide. Previously, the certification in the United States had been performed by a handful of companies.
Prosecutors allege that the senator was motivated to help Hana because Hana was using his halal company to wire bribe money to Nadine Menendez.
After the monopoly, Hana was living large. The company was headquartered in Edgewater, New Jersey, down the street from Hana’s new luxury apartment overlooking the Hudson River, in a building owned by the family of Daibes.
The man who had just lost his home to foreclosure now had enough money to help his friends with their mortgages. In July 2019, prosecutors said, Hana used his halal company to pay about $23,000 to bring Menendez current on her mortgage during her own foreclosure proceedings.
But soon, an FBI raid threatened to torpedo it all. In November 2019, federal agents searched Hana’s home and office, seizing electronic devices, papers, notepads, a photo album and even a gold cigarette.
During the search, federal agents questioned Hana about contacts he had in Egypt, including with an embassy employee, Hana said in a court filing. He said his entire family lived in Egypt.
Federal agents also discovered that Hana’s cellphone contained thousands of text messages with Nadine Menendez, prosecutors later said.
After a few months, with no criminal charges in sight, Hana asked the prosecutors to return his belongings. Among the seized items were a chain he bought in Italy, two Rolex watches that he said were gifts and a pair of earrings he said he designed for his mother that were worth about $15,000.
“I do not understand why the government would take my jewelry, which I would like to wear,” he wrote in a court filing. It was unclear whether he got his jewelry back.
Under Indictment
By 2020, federal officials said Hana’s halal company had essentially become an Egyptian state entity, winning an expanded monopoly to control the certification process for all food and beverages shipped to Egypt from anywhere in the world.
As his business prospered, prosecutors said, Hana made time to ensure that Nadine Menendez was placated. In June 2021, he bought 22 gold bars with unique serial numbers, valued at a total of about $40,000, according to prosecutors. Two of the gold bars were later found in the Menendez home by federal agents, prosecutors said.
The rapid expansion of his business led Hana to travel frequently, opening offices in Uruguay, India, Brazil, Egypt and New Zealand. Photos posted on the internet show him meeting with ambassadors and dignitaries around the world to discuss trade with Egypt.
Last year, Hana made a memorable impression on one former Western diplomat in Cairo. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Hana was an hour late to their lunch with no explanation or apology. They discussed the halal certification process, and Hana mentioned countries that were complaining about the prices he was charging.
The diplomat thought Hana was such a character that he wrote about it in his diary: He was “wearing an absurdly expensive suit, gold Rolex, gold rings. Spoke confidently, but softly, so you had to really listen.”
“In our second lunch,” he added, “he spent about twenty minutes telling me about his Rolex collection.”
After he was indicted, it was a decidedly less flashy Hana who appeared before a judge in U.S. District Court in Manhattan this past week, dressed in a baggy blue shirt and slacks.
He was released the same day after securing a $5 million bond — and agreeing to wear a GPS monitoring device.

Broker Is Sentenced to House Arrest in Homeless-Shelter Bribery Case: [National Desk]

Full text: The broker, Sheina Levin, was a former business partner of Victor Rivera, whose dealings were the subject of a New York Times investigation.
A New York real estate broker was sentenced to nine months of house arrest this week for paying a former shelter operator hundreds of thousands of dollars in a yearslong bribery scheme to profit from city funding meant for homeless people.
The broker, Sheina Levin, 61, owned a real estate company in Brooklyn. As the ranks of homeless people swelled in the city in recent years and the need for shelters grew more urgent, she paid a prominent shelter operator, Victor Rivera, more than $ 830,000 in kickbacks so his organization would lease property she controlled, federal prosecutors said.
Mr. Rivera, the former chief executive of the Bronx Parent Housing Network, pleaded guilty last year to federal crimes related to the bribery scheme and was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison. Mr. Rivera's financial entanglements with Ms. Levin, as well as wide-ranging accusations of sexual assault and harassment against him, were first revealed in a New York Times investigation in 2021.
Ms. Levin was sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud for her role in the pay-to-play scheme, which stretched from 2019 to 2021.
"Her felony conviction and the sentence imposed today show that those who put personal greed ahead of the needs of vulnerable city residents will face serious consequences," said Jocelyn E. Strauber, commissioner of the New York City Department of Investigation, which investigated the case with agents from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
In court filings, Ms. Levin described how Mr. Rivera first solicited bribes from her while they were working together to sublease several buildings she controlled in the Bronx as homeless shelters.
As the subleases were being arranged, Mr. Rivera demanded that he personally receive a cut of Ms. Levin's rental profits, and she complied, she said.
"I knew that doing so would enable the subleases to go forward and that these payments were improper," Ms. Levin said. "Mr. Rivera knew that I would make a profit on these arrangements due to my direct lease agreements with the owners of those properties."
Prosecutors said Ms. Levin disguised the payments to Mr. Rivera as consulting fees to a bogus company run by his son, and that he used the kickbacks to make mortgage payments on his home.
After Mr. Rivera helped found the Bronx Parent Housing Network two decades ago, he built the organization into one of the largest shelter operators in New York, netting $ 274 million in city money from 2017 to 2021. But as the money flowed in, Mr. Rivera treated the nonprofit group as his personal domain, The Times found, collecting an annual salary of $ 453,000, driving a Mercedes-Benz leased by the organization and steering millions of dollars in contracts to friends and associates.
Mr. Rivera demanded kickbacks from some of those associates as well, including a construction company and a security guard firm, according to prosecutors. But the bribes he received from Ms. Levin, his one-time partner in a separate housing venture, were the most substantial.
The felony charge Ms. Levin pleaded guilty to carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. But prosecutors recommended that she be sentenced to house arrest and two years of supervised release because they said she made "sincere efforts" to aid the investigation into Mr. Rivera.
She also agreed to forfeit more than $ 790,000 and pay more than $ 838,000 to the Bronx Parent Housing Network.
In a statement, Ms. Levin's lawyer said Mr. Rivera "manipulated her dedication to servicing the homeless population into supporting his own personal corruption."
"Ms. Levin acknowledges her terrible mistake in going along with Victor's demand for kickbacks," said the lawyer, Michael Farkas, "and she is committed to making full amends for her conduct."

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez and his wife, Nadine, were freed after posting personal recognizance bonds. He can travel out of the country, but only on official business.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and his wife, Nadine Menendez, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to bribery charges, marking the second time in eight years he has stood before a federal judge accused of trading his political influence for cash and luxury items.
The Menendezes were released on personal recognizance bonds. But a Manhattan federal magistrate judge told Mr. Menendez, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that he could travel out of the country only for official business, with prior notification to the court.
Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, and his wife of three years held hands as they left the 26th-floor courtroom, whispering briefly to each other as they headed downstairs to complete paperwork. Neither spoke nor answered questions shouted by reporters as they exited the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, four hours after they had arrived.
The arraignments followed an astonishing announcement last week that Mr. Menendez, his wife and three New Jersey businessmen had been charged in a lurid scheme to direct federal aid and weapons sales to Egypt in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars, bars of gold bullion and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.
The 39-page indictment also described efforts by Mr. Menendez, 69, to strong-arm prosecutors in New Jersey in an attempt to influence criminal investigations involving people tied to the Egyptian scheme.
He has said in recent days that he was confident he would be exonerated once the facts were fully presented, and he has cautioned against a rush to judgment. He has rejected calls from a growing number of top Democrats, including Gov. Philip D. Murphy and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, to step down.
Mr. Menendez was released on a $ 100,000 personal recognizance bond by the magistrate judge, Ona T. Wang. Ms. Menendez was released on a $ 250,000 bond, secured by their residence in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
One of the businessmen charged in the scheme, Wael Hana, an American citizen born in Egypt, was arrested Tuesday morning at Kennedy International Airport after he voluntarily flew to the United States from Egypt to face the charges, his lawyer said. He pleaded not guilty hours later, surrendered his passport and was granted release on a $ 5 million personal recognizance bond.
The two other businessmen charged with bribery conspiracy, Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer, and Jose Uribe, who works in the trucking industry, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday along with the Menendezes. Mr. Daibes and Mr. Uribe were also released with restrictions.
The conspiracy as alleged by prosecutors was far-reaching and depicted a web of corruption that even Mr. Booker, one of the senator's closest allies, called shocking and disturbing.
The scheme involved Mr. Hana, Mr. Daibes and Mr. Uribe making payments to Mr. Menendez and his wife in exchange for the senator's efforts to direct federal aid and weapons sales to Egypt, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said the plot also benefited Mr. Hana's halal meat business, which eventually won a contract to be the sole entity worldwide permitted by Egypt to certify that imported food products had been prepared according to Islamic law. Mr. Hana used his company, according to the indictment, to funnel bribes to the Menendezes.
The New Jersey-based company, IS EG Halal, reported little to no income until April 2019, when the Egyptian government gave it exclusive rights to certify meat coming from the United States, even though Mr. Hana had no experience in the industry, state and federal records show. Until then, four companies had divided the work.
"Seems like halal went through," Ms. Menendez said in a text to the senator, the indictment said. "It might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around."
When a high-level U.S. Department of Agriculture official publicly objected to the monopoly, concerned that it could increase the cost of food in Egypt and disrupt U.S. markets, Mr. Menendez tried to silence the official, the indictment said.
Investigators found $ 550,000 in cash, 13 bars of gold bullion and the Mercedes during a June 2022 search of a safe deposit box in Ms. Menendez's name and the couple's home.
The charges came after a lengthy investigation led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.
Much of the alleged activity occurred in New Jersey. But prosecutors noted that parts of the conspiracy, including a dinner meeting and sales of gold in Manhattan, and the use of a bank account first opened in the Bronx, took place within the Southern District's jurisdiction.
"My office is firmly committed to rooting out corruption, without fear or favor, and without any regard to partisan politics," Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, said in a statement. "We will continue to do so."
All five defendants are expected to return Monday for a hearing before Judge Sidney H. Stein. It will be held in the same Lower Manhattan courthouse, which is named for Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democratic titan who was New York's senior senator when Mr. Menendez first arrived in Congress in 1993.
Mr. Menendez was charged in 2015 with similar, but unrelated, corrupt acts by federal prosecutors in New Jersey. His trial in Newark lasted nine weeks, but the jury could not reach a unanimous decision. In January 2018, the Justice Department declined to retry him after a judge dismissed the most serious charges.
Prosecutors say the corruption scheme laid out in the new indictment began the following month.

Full text: The New Jersey Democrat broke barriers for Latinos. But prosecutors circled for decades before charging him with an explosive new bribery plot.
Robert Menendez's education in political corruption came unusually early. In 1982, he turned against his mentor, Mayor William V. Musto of Union City, N.J., the popular leader of their gritty hometown.
Mr. Menendez took the witness stand and testified that city officials had pocketed kickbacks on construction projects, helping to put a man widely seen as his father figure behind bars. Mr. Menendez, then 28, wore a bulletproof vest for a month.
The episode, which Mr. Menendez has used to cast himself as a gutsy Democratic reformer, helped fuel his remarkable rise from a Jersey tenement to the pinnacles of power in Washington as the state's senior senator. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr. Menendez broke barriers for Latinos and has used his perch as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to influence presidents and prime ministers.
But those who have closely followed his career say the years he spent enmeshed in Mr. Musto's machine also set the tone for another, more sinister undercurrent that now threatens to swallow it -- one in which Mr. Menendez became a power broker himself whose own close ties to moneyed interests have repeatedly attracted the scrutiny of federal prosecutors.
Those two sides of his life collided on Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan, where Mr. Menendez, 69, surrendered to face his second bribery indictment in less than a decade.
The explosive charges, unveiled on Friday, accuse the senator and his wife of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for helping increase U.S. assistance to Egypt and trying to throttle a pair of criminal investigations involving New Jersey businessmen. Investigators who searched their suburban home found piles of cash squirreled away, gold bars worth $ 100,000 and what they described as an ill-gotten Mercedes-Benz.
Mr. Menendez pleaded not guilty on Wednesday and refuses to resign. He has already begun accusing the government of twisting facts to try to criminalize legitimate congressional activity -- the same defense that helped him bottle up the last charges in a hung jury.
But interviews with nearly two dozen New Jersey political figures who worked with, watched and fought him, as well as a review of court records stretching back two decades, paint a far more complicated portrait of a man who has been both a pathbreaking legislator of unusual intelligence, and a vindictive politician with a propensity for accepting lavish gifts he could never have afforded on a government salary.
As a measure of how damning the indictment appears, no one -- not even a longtime ally recommended by Mr. Menendez's office -- agreed to publicly defend him on the conduct described by prosecutors.
"What we are witnessing is a pattern that developed early and just spun out of control," said Robert Torricelli, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey who served alongside Mr. Menendez in Washington. "People don't often change. In a lot of ways, Bob Menendez is still a Union City commissioner in the late 1970s."
The pervasiveness of corruption in Hudson County, N.J., a dense expanse of blue-collar cities just across the Hudson River from New York City, extends well beyond the 1970s. From Bayonne to North Bergen, mayors, a county executive, state lawmakers and council members alike have gone down on corruption charges.
No one seemed to learn a lesson, especially in Union City: Mr. Musto's immediate successor, Robert C. Botti, was indicted seven weeks after taking office, and received an 18-month prison sentence.
As corruption charges rained down around him, Mr. Menendez prospered, becoming a master of the kind of back-room deal-making that was dying out in other parts of the country as he rose through elected offices.
Prosecutors have spent the better part of 18 years, the length of Mr. Menendez's Senate tenure, looking into the blurry lines between his office and special interests. That dubious investigative distinction is approached by no other modern senator.
Many of the suspicions that attracted their attention never amounted to charges, but other facts still raised concerns. He accepted rides on private planes, luxurious vacations, and other perks from wealthy friends while freely using his office to advance their interests, earning a stern rebuke by the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee in 2018. He helped advance the careers of longtime friends and love interests who remained loyal. And when they crossed him, he did not hesitate to use a deep Rolodex to exact payback.
Mr. Torricelli, who retired amid his own ethics scandal, said he harbored concerns about the senator for years. Yet like other Democrats, he looked the other way, willing to move past suspicions out of personal loyalty, disbelief or appreciation for the liberal political policies Mr. Menendez championed in Congress, from immigration reform to abortion rights.
In recent years, that vacuum allowed the senator to continue burnishing his legacy, even amid a drumbeat of damaging leaks about the latest investigation. His daughter, Alicia Menendez, secured her own weekend show on MSNBC. He helped his son, Robert Menendez Jr., win his old House seat in 2022. And he had taken steps toward running for a fourth term.
Now, after 49 years in public life, all of it is at risk of disintegrating.
"This will be the biggest fight yet," Mr. Menendez said at a news conference in Union City earlier this week, as he dug in his heels. "Remember, prosecutors get it wrong sometimes. Sadly, I know that."
'More of a boss than a politician'
Even for the Senate, filled with high achievers and fast climbers, Mr. Menendez had trained his sights on elected office from an uncommonly young age. He won his first, a seat on the Union City school board, at just 20 after he was told in high school he would have to pay for his own books if he wanted to take honors classes.
A dense knot of factories and inexpensive housing, Union City had long been a magnet for immigrants, and at the time Mr. Menendez was coming of age, refugees fleeing the Cuban Revolution were remaking it into a little Havana. His own parents, a seamstress and carpenter, had come earlier.
But for Mr. Menendez, the timing was just right. The region's fast-growing Latino population provided the bilingual Democrat a reliable base -- sometimes delivering him 75 percent or more of the vote -- to fuel a steady ascent.
Mr. Menendez's election to the school board put him in touch with Mr. Musto, who hired him as an aide while he finished college and law school. He would eventually break with Mr. Musto, testifying at trial and running against him in 1982; Mr. Musto somehow prevailed in that election, held just after he was sentenced to prison. Four years later, Mr. Menendez was elected mayor, and seats in the Assembly, State Senate and then Congress, in 1993, soon followed.
In Washington, he thrived in the halls of the clubby Senate. He serenaded colleagues and longtime supporters on their birthdays in a high baritone and quickly mastered the delicate levers that could hold up nominations and torpedo bills until his priorities were included.
At night, he could often be found at Morton's steakhouse near the White House, where he billed his campaign accounts $ 16,000 a year, on average, The New York Post once wrote, enjoying a cigar on the balcony.
With money from Washington, Mr. Menendez is credited with helping realize a light-rail network in Hudson County that moves tens of thousands of people a day, securing billions of dollars in federal aid to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the state in 2012, and more recently, shouldering forward a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson, the largest public works project in the nation.
He frequently clashed with presidents in his own party on foreign policy. He sharply criticized the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, fought President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, and became a one-man wrecking ball in an attempt to stop Mr. Obama from normalizing relations with Cuba.
"Bob labored intensely to master detail," said James E. McGreevey, a former New Jersey governor who resigned two decades ago in scandal. "He relished both the subject matter and the process, and typically had among the strongest commands."
But back home, his popularity was also enforced by fear.
"In the beginning yeah, we used to bust each other's balls -- had a lot of fun with him," said Richard J. Codey, another former governor and longtime state legislator. "As time passed, he started to become more of a boss than a politician."
In 1999, when he was in Congress, Mr. Menendez effectively ousted a former protégé, Rudy Garcia, as mayor of Union City after Mr. Garcia fired Donald Scarinci, a lawyer who served as city attorney, and who was the then-congressman's friend since childhood. Mr. Menendez had come to view Mr. Garcia as a possible political threat.
"Bob resented it, and Rudy refused to become totally his alter-ego, like some others," said Joseph Doria, a Hudson County Democrat who served as speaker of the assembly. "They had a big war."
Another fight erupted in 2004, when the mayor of Jersey City recruited Steven Fulop to try to primary Mr. Menendez. Mr. Fulop, an Iraq War veteran and Goldman Sachs analyst in his 20s, had no shot at winning, but the Jersey City mayor wanted to send a message to Mr. Menendez, a political rival.
Mr. Menendez was furious. He called the home phone of the Goldman managing director who was handling government relations around the construction of the bank's massive new tower in his district in Jersey City at the time. The managing director, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the previously unreported episode, recalled Mr. Menendez's screams. He said he later called Mr. Menendez back to assure him the bank had been unaware of Mr. Fulop's campaign.
A spokesman for Mr. Menendez disputed on Tuesday that the call ever happened.
In an interview, Mr. Fulop said he was promptly summoned by the head of Goldman's human resources department and was told, "we don't run primaries against sitting congressmen." He worried he would lose his job, but did not, and stayed in the race and lost. He is now mayor of Jersey City himself, and is running for governor.
"I don't think anyone would ever classify Bob Menendez as a beacon of morals and ethics," said Mr. Fulop, who later reconciled with Mr. Menendez then fell out with him anew. "That was never how he built his career."
A new senator, an indictment and a 'resurrection'
Mr. Menendez's ascension to the Senate in 2006 was the culmination of a dream he had harbored since he was a teenager. But no sooner had he moved across the Capitol than federal prosecutors in New Jersey began investigating.
Their interest centered, at first, on North Hudson Community Action Corporation, a nonprofit that paid Mr. Menendez some $ 300,000 over nine years in rent at the same time he helped secure the group millions of dollars in federal grants. Prosecutors wanted to know if the payments were market rate.
Mr. Menendez was initially appointed to the Senate to fill the seat vacated by Jon Corzine when he became governor, and he was running for a full term that fall when news of a subpoena for the nonprofit leaked. The senator denied any wrongdoing and accused the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Chris Christie, of political high jinks to help his Republican opponent.
But the investigation opened the door to federal scrutiny that would follow Mr. Menendez almost continually in the Senate, as prosecutors scrutinized suspicious dealings involving a mix of romantic interests, Hudson County developers and new friends with vast resources.
Many of Mr. Menendez's longtime political allies said they were surprised only by the luridness of the most recent charges, but not the idea that he would accept gifts from wealthier friends. Despite his growing political clout, Mr. Menendez remained one of the poorest members of the Senate -- having never officially earned much more than a government paycheck.
"You're dealing with people around you who need you and want you who are multimillionaires," Mr. Codey said, adding: "The temptation is too much."
By 2007, scrutiny fell on his relationship with Kay LiCausi, a former aide almost two decades his junior whom he was widely reported to be dating. (He had divorced his wife, a teacher, in 2005.) After she left his office, Mr. Menendez helped Ms. LiCausi secure lucrative consulting contracts with Democratic groups. She also began working for companies and organizations with ties to the senator who needed his help in Washington. He again denied any misconduct.
An executive for a company trying to develop a billion-dollar mall and entertainment complex in the Meadowlands later testified to a grand jury that he hired Ms. LiCausi to lobby because of her connections to Mr. Menendez. After the senator helped with an Army Corps of Engineers permit for the project, the executive testified, he was asked to raise $ 50,000 for Mr. Menendez's campaign, Bloomberg News reported in 2015 based on court documents.
Prosecutors closed the investigation in 2011 without bringing charges. The next year, the senator caused a stir when he objected to the nomination of an appeals court judge whose longtime partner worked on the investigation. He said it was not political, and under pressure from the White House, he eventually relented.
Unharmed by the yearslong saga, Mr. Menendez easily won a second term that fall, rising to the Foreign Relations chairmanship.
But the reprieve would only be short-lived: just days before Mr. Menendez took the gavel, the F.B.I. raided the office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye surgeon whom Mr. Menendez counted among his closest friends.
It took two years to bring charges, but in 2015, Mr. Menendez became the first sitting senator in a generation to be charged with federal bribery.
The indictment painted a deeply unsavory portrait of his Senate office, where his chief of staff helped solicit gifts and track what Dr. Melgen needed. Prosecutors said that Mr. Menendez went to great personal lengths, lobbying other high-ranking government officials to help resolve a multimillion-dollar Medicare billing dispute and to protect the surgeon's business interests in the Dominican Republic. The senator also helped his friend's foreign girlfriends obtain travel visas to the United States, they said.
Dr. Melgen was generous in return, with $ 700,000 in donations to support the senator's campaigns and the kind of luxury travel Mr. Menendez could scarcely have imagined as a younger man: rides on a private plane, stays at a Dominican villa and a Paris hotel.
Mr. Menendez's lawyers did not dispute most of the actions; they cast them not as corruption, but the fruits of a decades-old friendship and the senator's policy interests. Prosecutors had another unforeseen challenge: Between their indictment and the trial in 2017, the Supreme Court had issued a landmark decision raising the bar the government needed to meet to prove political corruption.
The trial ended in a hung jury just before Thanksgiving 2017. When Mr. Menendez stepped outside of the federal courthouse in Newark, he declared his "resurrection day" -- and revenge.
At the time, Democrats played down the seriousness of the charges and largely hung with him, in part because Mr. Christie was governor and could have appointed a fellow Republican to fill a vacant seat. Mr. Menendez limped to re-election in 2018, largely on the strength of anti-Trump backlash, according to Democrats involved in the party's races.
"In New Jersey, we have been willing to overlook a lot for people who believe in the same values we do," said Loretta Weinberg, who served as majority leader of the State Senate.
For Mr. Menendez, the victories papered over what had been an exceedingly painful period in his life. His fiancée, Alicia Mucci, broke off their engagement on the eve of the bribery trial, years after he proposed in the Capitol Rotunda, she said in a brief interview. He moved out and, as a bachelor once again his 60s, was a regular at Fornos of Spain, just a few blocks from the courthouse.
It was only a few months later, prosecutors say, that Mr. Menendez began dating Nadine Arslanian, the woman who would become his wife and soon introduce him to key figures whose fates are now intertwined with his in court.

The next year, the senator caused a stir when he objected to the nomination of an appeals court judge whose longtime partner worked on the investigation. He said it was not political, and under pressure from the White House, he eventually relented.
Unharmed by the yearslong saga, Menendez easily won a second term that fall, rising to the Foreign Relations chairmanship.
But the reprieve would only be short-lived: just days before Menendez took the gavel, the FBI raided the office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye surgeon who Menendez counted among his closest friends.
It took two years to bring charges, but in 2015, Menendez became the first sitting senator in a generation to be charged with federal bribery.
The indictment painted a deeply unsavory portrait of his Senate office, where his chief of staff helped solicit gifts and track what Melgen needed. Prosecutors said that Menendez went to great personal lengths, lobbying other high-ranking government officials to help resolve a multimillion-dollar Medicare billing dispute and to protect the surgeon’s business interests in the Dominican Republic. The senator also helped his friend’s foreign girlfriends obtain travel visas to the United States, they said.
Melgen was generous in return, with $700,000 in donations to support the senator’s campaigns and the kind of luxury travel Menendez could scarcely have imagined as a younger man: rides on a private plane, stays at a Dominican villa and a Paris hotel.
Menendez’s lawyers did not dispute most of the actions; they cast them not as corruption, but the fruits of a decades-old friendship and the senator’s policy interests. Prosecutors had another unforeseen challenge: Between their indictment and the trial in 2017, the Supreme Court had issued a landmark decision raising the bar the government needed to meet to prove political corruption.
The trial ended in a hung jury just before Thanksgiving 2017. When Menendez stepped outside the federal courthouse in Newark, he declared his “resurrection day” — and revenge.
At the time, Democrats played down the seriousness of the charges and largely hung with him, in part because Christie was governor and could have appointed a fellow Republican to fill a vacant seat. Menendez limped to reelection in 2018, largely on the strength of the anti-Trump backlash, according to Democrats involved in the party’s races.
“In New Jersey, we have been willing to overlook a lot for people who believe in the same values we do,” said Loretta Weinberg, who served as majority leader of the state Senate.
For Menendez, the victories papered over what had been an exceedingly painful period in his life. His fiancée, Alicia Mucci, broke off their engagement on the eve of the bribery trial, years after he proposed in the Capitol Rotunda, she said in a brief interview. He moved out and, as a bachelor once again his 60s, was a regular at Fornos of Spain, just a few blocks from the courthouse.
It was only a few months later, prosecutors say, that Menendez began dating Nadine Arslanian, the woman who would become his wife and soon introduce him to key figures whose fates are now intertwined with his in court.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, charged with taking bribes in exchange for exerting political influence, predicted that he would be exonerated.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey returned Monday to the familiar territory of Hudson County, N.J., a Democratic bastion where he rose to political prominence, to publicly address the corruption charges that now threaten his career and his freedom.
Standing alone at a lectern, accused of bribery for the second time in a decade, he indicated that he had no intention of bowing to the chorus of voices calling for his resignation.
The allegations, he said, were framed by prosecutors to "be as salacious as possible."
"I recognize that this will be the biggest fight yet," Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, said as heavy rain beat against the windows of a community college not far from where he grew up in Union City, the child of Cuban immigrants.
But he said he expected that once the judicial process concluded, "not only will I be exonerated, I will still be New Jersey's senior senator."
Speaking first in English and then in Spanish, Mr. Menendez, 69, reiterated much of the message he offered immediately after the three-count indictment was announced on Friday. He urged patience "to allow all the facts to be presented."
He was not joined by family members or any of his most stalwart political allies as he faced a bank of television cameras and a standing-room-only crowd of reporters. Behind him, against a wall, were roughly two dozen people he called "everyday people and constituents who know me."
Mr. Menendez left without answering questions shouted by reporters about the gifts, including gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, that prosecutors say he received as bribe payments.
He did, however, attempt to offer a justification for the $ 550,000 in cash investigators found during June 2022 searches of a safe deposit box and his home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., much of it stashed in clothing and closets or stuffed into envelopes. Some of the envelopes containing the cash had the fingerprints of a businessman charged in the scheme; one envelope also had Mr. Menendez's fingerprints, according to the indictment.
Mr. Menendez said that it had been his habit to withdraw cash from his savings accounts to keep at home, a tendency he said was rooted in his parents' experience in Cuba.
"This may seem old-fashioned," he said, adding, "I look forward to addressing other issues at trial."
It was the first time he had appeared publicly since federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed a 39-page indictment that accused him and his wife, Nadine Menendez, of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for wielding his political influence to benefit the government of Egypt and business associates in New Jersey.
The indictment depicted a far-reaching web of political corruption involving aid and weapons sales to Egypt and efforts by Mr. Menendez to persuade state and federal prosecutors to go easy on his associates in three criminal cases.
Mr. Menendez and the others accused in the bribery conspiracy -- his wife and three New Jersey businessmen -- are expected to appear Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan to respond to the charges.
He stepped down Friday as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, as required by rules the Senate Democrats adopted to govern themselves.
Ms. Menendez, 56, who has been married to the senator for three years, did not attend the news conference.
One longtime friend, Joseph Panepinto, a New Jersey developer, said Mr. Menendez's office called to ask him to attend the event. He said he wanted to be there to support his friend of 40 years.
"I see he has a problem," Mr. Panepinto said. "I hope he's innocent. If he's proven guilty, he'll pay the price."
"What happened? I don't know," he added. "I have no idea. I'm wondering why he has so much cash in his house, but that's his business."
New Jersey's governor, Philip D. Murphy, a close ally of Mr. Menendez, called for the senator's resignation hours after the charges were announced, unleashing a torrent of similar messages from Democratic leaders across the state.
In Washington, however, the reaction among Democrats has been more muted; by late Monday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a close friend of Mr. Menendez's, still had taken no public position on the charges outlined in the indictment.
At the White House, President Biden's press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said that the decision about whether Mr. Menendez should step down was "going to be up to him and the Senate leadership."
Representative Andy Kim, a third-term Democrat from South Jersey, said Saturday that he would challenge Mr. Menendez in next year's primary, and he wasted no time in establishing a campaign committee.
"New Jersey deserves better," Mr. Kim said Monday on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. "Menendez just had a press conference doubling down on his refusal to resign. Then we have to beat him in the primary election."
The response from New Jersey Democrats was a marked departure from 2017, when most Democratic leaders stood solidly at Mr. Menendez's side while he stood trial in federal court on charges that he had taken bribes from a wealthy doctor in exchange for political favors.
The jury could not reach a unanimous decision, and the Justice Department declined to retry Mr. Menendez after a judge dismissed the most serious charges.
At Monday's news conference, Mr. Menendez alluded to his previous case. "Remember, prosecutors get it wrong sometimes," he said. "Sadly, I know that."
Still, Republicans said that Mr. Menendez's legal problems would only bolster their effort to win over voters in November, when lawmakers are running for re-election in the State Assembly and Senate.
"It's a real problem for Democrats that he's not going away quietly," said Alexandra Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the state Republican Party.
"If you're the Democrats, this is not what you want to have be the top story on every single news station, every single night."

Four Key Things to Note In Menendez Indictment: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The New Jersey senator, his wife and three businessmen have been accused of conducting a range of corrupt schemes in the United States and abroad.
In a 39-page indictment, federal prosecutors on Friday accused Robert Menendez, the powerful New Jersey senator and Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of accepting bribes that included a luxury car, expensive exercise machines, mortgage payments, bars of gold bullion and more than $ 500,000 in cash.
In exchange for the bribes, Mr. Menendez wielded his power to increase U.S. assistance to Egypt and do favors for New Jersey businessmen, prosecutors said.
The indictment also names Mr. Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, and three businessmen: Fred Daibes, a prominent New Jersey builder; Wael Hana, the founder of a halal meat certification company with headquarters in New Jersey; and Jose Uribe, a former insurance agent from Union City, N.J., who worked in the trucking industry.
All five defendants have been charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. The senator and his wife were also charged with conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official right, meaning that they leveraged Mr. Menendez's role as a U.S. senator to force someone to give them something of value.
Mr. Menendez has maintained his innocence, accusing the Manhattan federal prosecutors who brought the case of misrepresenting routine congressional work. Lawyers for Ms. Menendez, Mr. Hana and Mr. Daibes have also denied the charges. A representative for Mr. Uribe could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
Here are four takeaways from the indictment:
Mr. Menendez is accused of using his official position to influence arms sales and U.S. aid to Egypt.
Mr. Menendez met Mr. Hana, an American-Egyptian businessman who had relationships with top intelligence and military officials in Egypt, in early 2018, according to the indictment. Ms. Menendez, then Nadine Arslanian, was longtime friends with Mr. Hana and was eager to introduce him to Mr. Menendez, whom she had recently begun dating.
In the months and years that followed, prosecutors said, Ms. Menendez and Mr. Hana arranged a series of meetings for Mr. Menendez with Egyptian officials, who made various requests of the senator. In one text to an Egyptian general, Mr. Hana referred to Mr. Menendez as "our man."
The group carried out an agreement in which Mr. Menendez would use his position to facilitate military equipment sales and financing to Egypt and, in exchange, Mr. Hana would put Ms. Menendez on his company's payroll for a low- or no-show job, the indictment says.
At one point in 2018, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez texted "highly sensitive" information from the State Department about employees at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to Ms. Menendez. She forwarded it to Mr. Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official.
Mr. Menendez also ghostwrote a lobbying letter from an Egyptian official in 2018 asking U.S. senators to release a hold on $ 300 million in aid, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors noted that, at the time, the United States had been withholding additional aid money until Egypt was able to prove it had made improvements on human rights issues.
The indictment quotes text messages from Ms. Menendez bragging about the senator's influence. In March 2020, Ms. Menendez texted an Egyptian official, "anytime you need anything you have my number and we will make everything happen."
The indictment says Mr. Menendez took action to help the company that was paying his girlfriend.
In 2018, Mr. Hana's company, IS EG Halal Certified Inc., had little to no revenue, prosecutors said, and Ms. Menendez began to complain to her husband and others that she was not being paid. She caused at least one of Mr. Hana's associates to believe that Mr. Menendez would stop working to help Mr. Hana and the Egyptian government unless Mr. Hana paid her, the indictment says.
In the spring of 2019, the Egyptian government granted Mr. Hana's business a monopoly on certifying U.S. food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards, even though the company had no experience with such certification, the indictment says. The next day, Ms. Menendez texted Mr. Hana: "Seems like halal went through. It might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around."
The monopoly resulted in increased costs for U.S. meat suppliers, which prompted the United States Department of Agriculture to ask Egyptian officials to reconsider their decision. Two days after a meeting in which Mr. Hana asked for Mr. Menendez's help in countering the U.S.D.A.'s objections, Mr. Menendez personally called a "high-level" U.S.D.A. official and insisted that the agency stop opposing the monopoly, the indictment says. The official did not reverse his stance, but Mr. Hana's company kept its monopoly.
About two months later, Mr. Hana's company paid Ms. Menendez $ 23,000 to bring her mortgage payments up to date. When it was suggested to Ms. Menendez that Mr. Hana might be taken aback by the amount needed for the mortgage, she boasted that her actions would eventually make Mr. Hana "more powerful than the president of Egypt."
Still, Ms. Menendez believed she had not been paid all of the money she was owed for helping Mr. Hana's company, the indictment says. She texted Mr. Menendez, "I am soooooo upset," and asked whether she should text Mr. Hana's associate, Mr. Daibes, to complain, but the senator replied, "No, you should not text or email." Ms. Menendez then called Mr. Daibes, and Mr. Hana's company sent $ 10,000 to a consulting firm Ms. Menendez had founded and often used to receive bribes, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said Mr. Menendez accepted money and valuable items in exchange for meddling in a prosecution and a criminal investigation.
In exchange for cash, furniture and gold bars, Mr. Menendez interfered with criminal proceedings on behalf of two New Jersey businessmen, one of whom was a longtime fund-raiser for the senator, the indictment says.
Prosecutors said that in 2019, Mr. Uribe, who had previously been convicted of fraud, and Mr. Hana asked Mr. Menendez to intervene in the criminal prosecution of one of Mr. Uribe's business associates. They offered to buy a new Mercedes-Benz convertible worth more than $ 60,000 for Ms. Menendez, who had recently been in a car accident that had left her without a car.
Mr. Menendez pressured a senior prosecutor at the New Jersey attorney general's office, who was supervising the case, to resolve it in the defendant's favor. The official thought the request was inappropriate and did not agree to intervene, according to the indictment; Mr. Uribe's associate ultimately received a plea deal with no jail time.
A few days after Mr. Menendez called the prosecutor, Ms. Menendez texted Mr. Hana: "All is GREAT! I'm so excited to get a car next week." She met Mr. Uribe in a parking lot of a restaurant, where he gave her about $ 15,000 in cash, the indictment says. She made the down payment on the new Mercedes the next day. After the purchase, Mr. Uribe texted her, "are you happy?," to which she responded, "I will never forget this."
The indictment says that Mr. Menendez also agreed to try to influence the federal prosecution of Mr. Daibes, who had raised money for him, including by recommending that President Biden nominate a particular lawyer, Philip R. Sellinger, to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey because the senator believed he could influence Mr. Sellinger's handling of the prosecution.
At one point during the period from late 2020 to early 2022 in which Mr. Menendez was seeking to interfere in Mr. Daibes's case, Mr. Menendez and Ms. Menendez were picked up at the airport after a trip to Egypt by Mr. Daibes's driver. The next day, the senator typed in an internet search, "how much is one kilo of gold worth." An F.B.I. search of the couple's home last year found multiple gold bars that prosecutors said were given to them by Mr. Daibes, along with cash and furniture.
The New Jersey U.S. attorney's office did not bend to the pressure campaign, the indictment said. Mr. Daibes pleaded guilty in April 2022.
The senator now faces calls to resign and at least one new primary challenger.
This is not the first time Mr. Menendez has been accused of corruption. In 2015, federal prosecutors in New Jersey charged the senator with bribery and accused him of performing political favors for a wealthy eye doctor in exchange for lavish gifts worth close to $ 1 million, including vacations to the Caribbean and campaign contributions. The trial ended in a hung jury in November 2017, and the judge later acquitted Mr. Menendez of several charges. The Justice Department dismissed the others.
During that case, Democrats largely rallied around Mr. Menendez, whose replacement would have been chosen by Chris Christie, who was then the Republican governor. In contrast, by Saturday afternoon, nearly every major Democratic figure in New Jersey had called on Mr. Menendez to resign, including Gov. Philip D. Murphy, senior members of Congress and influential state and county party chairmen.
When the indictment was unsealed, Mr. Menendez already had a Democratic primary opponent, Kyle Jasey, a real estate lender and first-time candidate who called the indictment an "embarrassment for our state." Another New Jersey congressman, Andy Kim, declared his candidacy on social media Saturday afternoon.
Mr. Menendez's colleagues in the Senate accepted his temporary resignation as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, but they did not ask him to leave office.

Does Menendez Have Enough Teflon to Survive the New Charges?: [National Desk]

Full text: Senator Menendez, who has defeated prosecutors and political challengers, faces his sternest test yet in his federal indictment in Manhattan.
In a state long attuned to the drumbeat of political corruption -- salacious charges, furious denials, explosive trials -- Senator Robert Menendez has often registered as the quintessential New Jersey politician.
He successfully avoided charges in one case, and after federal prosecutors indicted him in another, he got off after a mistrial in 2017. "To those who were digging my political grave," Mr. Menendez warned then with characteristic bravado, "I know who you are and I won't forget you."
Six years later, he is once again on the brink, battling for his political life after federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed a jarring new indictment on Friday charging the powerful Democratic senator and his wife in a garish bribery scheme involving a foreign power, piles of cash and gold bars.
A defiant Mr. Menendez, 69, immediately vowed to clear his name from what he cast as just more smears by vengeful prosecutors. A top adviser said that he would also continue running for re-election in 2024, when he is trying to secure a fourth full term.
But as details of the case quickly spread through Trenton and Washington -- including images of an allegedly ill-begotten Mercedes-Benz convertible and cash bribes hidden in closets -- it was clear Mr. Menendez may be confronting the gravest political challenge in a career that started 49 years ago in the shadow of New York City.
By Saturday afternoon, nearly every major Democratic figure in the state had called on him to resign, including the governor, senior members of Congress and influential state and county party chairmen. It was a dramatic contrast to 2015, when Democrats largely rallied around Mr. Menendez in the face of his first indictment.
Party strategists and elected officials were already openly speculating that one or more of a group of ambitious, young Democrats representing the state in Congress could mount a primary campaign against him. One of them, Representative Andy Kim, declared his candidacy on social media Saturday afternoon, setting up a highly unusual showdown.
"Not something I expected to do, but NJ deserves better," he wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. "We cannot jeopardize the Senate or compromise our integrity."
For now, Mr. Menendez appeared to be on firmer footing among his colleagues in the Senate, notably including Senator Cory Booker, his fellow New Jersey Democrat, who had not commented publicly. They accepted his temporary resignation as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, but did not ask him to leave office.
In a statement, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, called Mr. Menendez "a dedicated public servant" and said that his colleague had "a right to due process and a fair trial."
Calls for his ouster seemed to only embolden Mr. Menendez, who spent part of Friday afternoon trying to rally allies by phone. "It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat," he wrote in a fiery retort to Democrats who broke with him. "I am not going anywhere."
His campaign did not immediately comment on Mr. Kim's announcement.
The electoral stakes were high, and not just for Mr. Menendez.
Though he had yet to formally answer the charges in court, some party strategists were gauging the possibility that Mr. Menendez could be scheduled to stand trial in the middle of the campaign -- an unwelcome distraction for Democratic candidates across the nation.
Republicans were already using the indictment to attack the party. "Democrats covered for Menendez the first time he got indicted for corruption," said Philip Letsou, a spokesman for the Senate Republican campaign committee. "It would be a shame if they did so again."
Democrats have not lost a Senate race in New Jersey since the 1970s. But allowing Mr. Menendez to stay in office could at the least force the party to spend heavily there at a time when it faces daunting odds of retaining a razor-thin majority. Some party officials worried it could also dampen Democrats' performance in competitive New Jersey legislative races this fall.
"I understand personal loyalty, and I understand the depths of friendships, but somebody needs to take a stand here," said Robert Torricelli, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey. "This is not about him -- it's about holding the majority."
Mr. Torricelli speaks from experience. He retired rather than seek re-election in 2002 after his own ethics scandal ended without charges. He was also widely believed to be a target of Mr. Menendez's ire after the former senator put his hand up to succeed Mr. Menendez had he been convicted in 2017.
"In the history of the United States Congress, it is doubtful there has ever been a corruption allegation of this depth and seriousness," Mr. Torricelli added. "The degree of the evidence. The gold bars and the hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash. It's incomprehensible."
The details laid out in the 39-page indictment were nothing short of tawdry. Prosecutors said that Mr. Menendez had used his position to provide sensitive government information to Egypt, browbeat the Department of Agriculture and tamper with a criminal investigation. In exchange, associates rewarded him with the gold bullion, car and cash, along with home mortgage payments and other benefits, they said.
Prosecutors referred to a text between an Egyptian general and an Egyptian American businessman in which Mr. Menendez was referred to as "our man." At one point, prosecutors said, the senator searched in a web browser "how much is one kilo of gold worth."
Mr. Menendez is far from the first elected official in New Jersey to face serious criminal allegations. With a long tradition of one-party rule, a bare-knuckle political culture and an unusual patchwork of governmental fiefs, the state has been a hotbed for corruption that has felled city councilors, mayors, state legislators and members of Congress.
The Washington Post tried to quantify the criminality in 2015 and found that New Jersey's rate of crime per politician easily led any other state.
Mr. Menendez already has a Democratic primary opponent, Kyle Jasey, a real estate lender and first-time candidate who called the indictment an "embarrassment for our state." But political strategists and elected Democrats said Mr. Jasey may not have the lane to himself for long.
New Jersey has a glut of Democratic members of Congress with outsize national profiles; it took barely minutes on Friday for the state's political class to begin speculating about who might step forward.
In addition to Mr. Kim, 41, the most prominent possible contenders were Representatives Mikie Sherrill, 51, and Josh Gottheimer, 48, moderates who were already said to be looking at statewide campaigns for governor in 2025, when Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, cannot run because of term limits. Other names included Tom Malinowski, a two-term congressman who lost his seat last year.
National Republicans put their focus on Christine Serrano Glassner, the two-term mayor of a small community roughly 25 miles west of Newark, who quickly branded her opponent "Gold Bar Bob."
Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, was elected to his first local office at age 20. At 28, he donned a bulletproof vest as he testified in a corruption trial against his former mentor. He won the mayoralty of Union City, before moving onto the State Assembly, the Senate, the House of Representatives and, in 2006, an appointment to the Senate.
It was only a matter of months before he was in the sights of the U.S. attorney's office of New Jersey. The senator was never charged, but the investigation became campaign fodder after the U.S. attorney, then Chris Christie, issued a subpoena to a community agency that paid rent to Mr. Menendez while getting lucrative federal grants.
Almost a decade later, federal prosecutors went further, making Mr. Menendez the first sitting senator in a generation to face federal bribery charges in 2015. They accused him of exchanging political favors with a wealthy Florida eye surgeon for luxury vacations, expensive flights and campaign donations.
A jury heard the case two years later and could not reach a verdict; the Justice Department later dropped the prosecution, but the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee "severely admonished" him for accepting gifts while promoting the surgeon's interests.
Even so, Mr. Menendez handily won his party's nomination and re-election in 2018.
To longtime analysts of the state politics, though, Friday's case crossed a new threshold.
"Even by New Jersey standards, this one stands out -- how graphic it is, how raw it is," said Micah Rasmussen, a seasoned Democratic political hand who now leads Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.
"There is a world of difference between not reporting a plane ride and having half a million in hundreds stashed around your house," Mr. Rasmussen added. "By all rights, this should be the end of the line."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Federal prosecutors have accused Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and his wife, Nadine, of accepting bribes in exchange for official actions by Mr. Menendez.
It was January 2018, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey had just won a huge legal victory. His trial on federal bribery charges had ended in a hung jury, and the U.S. Justice Department had announced that it would not seek a new trial. He was free to walk with no criminal conviction, ready to take on another campaign for re-election.
Weeks later, he started dating Nadine Arslanian.
Ms. Arslanian, who would eventually marry Mr. Menendez, quickly introduced him to one of her longtime friends: Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman in New Jersey. The future Ms. Menendez was eager to connect her influential new boyfriend with Mr. Hana's high-level connections in the Egyptian government.
What unfolded in the next four years is what prosecutors described on Friday as a sprawling corruption scheme that would ensnare the halal meat industry, American military aid to Egypt and the appointment of a top New Jersey law enforcement official. Prosecutors accused Mr. Menendez, 69, of abusing his power to influence arms sales to Egypt and to attempt to interfere with criminal investigations into Mr. Hana's web of business associates.
An F.B.I. search last year of the couple's New Jersey home revealed some of the fruits of their scheme, prosecutors said. Federal agents found more than $ 480,000 in cash stuffed throughout the house in envelopes and in the pockets of jackets that were embroidered with the senator's name. Inside the home were more than $ 100,000 worth of gold bars, some of which had unique serial numbers that traced back to Mr. Hana. A shiny Mercedes-Benz convertible sat in the garage.
The 39-page indictment -- which laid out in painstaking detail a series of deleted text messages, encrypted phone calls and shell company payments -- painted a portrait of a couple motivated by relentless greed.
Ms. Menendez, 56, often pestered her associates for more bribe payments, prosecutors said, and did not hesitate to peacock her husband's influence, once sending a news article to Mr. Hana about $ 2.5 billion of military sales to Egypt and writing, "Bob had to sign off on this." The business associates around Mr. Hana seemed to find more and more ways to extract what they needed from Mr. Menendez, as long as they could deliver the cash.
The bribes even included two exercise machines and an air purifier that were delivered to the Menendez home, prosecutors said.
Mr. Menendez maintained his innocence on Friday, accusing the Manhattan federal prosecutors who brought the case of misrepresenting routine congressional work. Lawyers for Ms. Menendez and Mr. Hana, 40, also denied the charges.
When Ms. Menendez started dating Mr. Menendez in early 2018, she was unemployed. But her new relationship offered a solution.
Mr. Hana would agree to put Ms. Menendez on the payroll of his halal meat company if Mr. Menendez could promise to help facilitate more sales of military equipment to Egypt, prosecutors said.
At the time, the issue was a high priority for the Egyptian government because the U.S. State Department had been withholding some military aid until the country could show improvements on human rights. As the ranking member -- and soon-to-be chairman -- of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Menendez exerted significant influence over how much military aid the United States supplied to Egypt and other countries.
Mr. Menendez shared with his girlfriend sensitive information from the State Department about the number and nationalities of people working at the U.S. embassy in Cairo; she passed it to Mr. Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official, prosecutors said. Mr. Menendez also agreed to ghostwrite a letter from an Egyptian official who wished to urge the U.S. Senate for more military aid to Egypt.
In July 2018, after meetings between Mr. Menendez and Egyptian officials, he texted Ms. Menendez to tell Mr. Hana that he was going to sign off on a multimillion-dollar weapons sale to Egypt. Ms. Menendez forwarded the text to Mr. Hana, who sent it to two Egyptian officials, one of whom replied with a thumbs up emoji.
Mr. Hana and his business associate, Jose Uribe, then saw another opening to use Mr. Menendez, prosecutors said. They knew that Ms. Menendez had recently gotten into a car accident and needed a car, so they offered to buy the couple a new Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible, worth more than $ 60,000.
In exchange, they asked Mr. Menendez to interfere in an ongoing prosecution and criminal investigation involving Mr. Uribe's business associates. Mr. Uribe, 56, who worked in the trucking and insurance industries, had been previously convicted of fraud.
In early 2019, Mr. Menendez contacted a senior prosecutor at the New Jersey attorney general's office who was supervising the cases and pressured him to resolve them favorably for the defendants, the indictment said. The prosecutor did not agree to intervene, but one of the cases ultimately resulted in a plea deal with no jail time. In the other, no charges were ever brought.
A few days after Mr. Menendez called the prosecutor, Ms. Menendez texted Mr. Hana: "All is GREAT! I'm so excited to get a car next week."
She met Mr. Uribe in a parking lot of a restaurant, where he gave her about $ 15,000 in cash. She made the down payment on her new Mercedes the next day. "You are a miracle worker who makes dreams come true I will always remember that," she texted Mr. Uribe.
But around this time, a problem arose. Mr. Hana's halal meat company, IS EG Halal Certified Inc., had little to no revenue. Ms. Menendez, who prosecutors said had been given a "low-or-no-show job" there, started to complain to Mr. Hana's business associates that she wasn't getting paid. She texted Mr. Menendez about how upset she was about Mr. Hana's broken promises.
A major break came in the spring of 2019. The Egyptian government gave Mr. Hana's company a monopoly over certifying American food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards, in adherence with Islamic law. Mr. Hana's company, despite its name, had no experience with halal certification.
A huge financial windfall was coming.
The day after an Egyptian official informed Mr. Hana that his company was most likely going to become the sole halal certifier for U.S. imports, Ms. Menendez texted the senator: "Seems like halal went through. It might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around." The indictment did not say if Mr. Menendez used his position to influence Egypt's decision.
Soon afterward, Ms. Menendez created a consulting company, Strategic International Business Consultants LLC, which prosecutors said was used to receive tens of thousands of dollars in bribe payments.
Mr. Hana's monopoly, however, increased costs for some U.S. meat suppliers, which did not escape the notice of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In the spring of 2019, U.S.D.A. officials asked Egypt to reconsider the monopoly rights for halal certification, which had previously been granted to a handful of companies.
At Mr. Hana's request, Mr. Menendez called a high-level U.S.D.A. official and asked them to stop opposing the monopoly, prosecutors said. The official did not acquiesce to Mr. Menendez's demands, but Mr. Hana still kept sole control over the Egyptian certification.
Two months later, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana used his halal company to pay about $ 23,000 to Ms. Menendez to help her stay current on her mortgage while she was in foreclosure proceedings.
Still, prosecutors suggested, Ms. Menendez felt she deserved more money for all the help that her boyfriend was giving Mr. Hana, especially after the senator had agreed to meet with some senior Egyptian officials. She texted Mr. Menendez: "I am soooooo upset."
She wanted to complain to one of Mr. Hana's business associates, but Mr. Menendez warned her: "No, you should not text or email." She placed a call instead. The next day, Mr. Hana's halal company wired $ 10,000 to her consulting firm.
As their scheme expanded, prosecutors said, they deleted more and more texts and emails.
A few months after the couple married in October 2020, Mr. Menendez met with Philip Sellinger, a potential candidate to be nominated for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, the top federal prosecutor in the state.
This time, the indictment said, Mr. Menendez was carrying out his end of another corrupt bargain. In the meeting, Mr. Menendez criticized the ongoing case against Fred Daibes, who was indicted in 2018 by federal prosecutors in New Jersey. He also happened to be a business associate of Mr. Hana and a longtime fund-raiser for Mr. Menendez.
When Mr. Sellinger said that he might have to recuse himself from the investigation anyway because of a prior conflict of interest, Mr. Menendez said he would not be recommending him for U.S. attorney, according to the indictment.
Ultimately, Mr. Menendez did recommend Mr. Sellinger for the nomination, believing that he could influence the investigation if Mr. Sellinger held that post, prosecutors said. The indictment did not say why Mr. Menendez believed that.
In early 2022, Mr. Menendez placed two phone calls to the federal prosecutor overseeing Mr. Daibes's case. Minutes after the second call, Mr. Menendez called Mr. Daibes directly.
Two months later, Ms. Menendez ate lunch with Mr. Daibes and texted him afterward: "THANK YOU Fred," with a slew of emojis. The next day, Ms. Menendez met with a jeweler who was friends with Mr. Daibes and sold the jeweler two gold bars that prosecutors believe were previously owned by Mr. Daibes, worth about $ 120,000 at the time.
The New Jersey U.S. attorney's office did not bend to the pressure campaign, the indictment said. Mr. Daibes pleaded guilty in April 2022.
But the unraveling for the Menendez couple would soon begin.
In June 2022, federal agents raided their home. Some of the envelopes containing the wads of cash had the fingerprints and D.N.A. of Mr. Daibes and his driver -- marked with Mr. Daibes's return address, prosecutors said.
After the search, Mr. Uribe stopped making the monthly payments on the Mercedes convertible. Mr. Menendez wrote his wife a check for $ 23,000, part of which she gave to Mr. Uribe with the memo line: "personal loan." The indictment did not make clear what the purpose of the payment was.
It was too late. On Friday, Mr. Menendez was indicted on three federal charges and temporarily stepped down from his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The indictment also charged his wife, Mr. Hana, Mr. Uribe and Mr. Daibes.
A lawyer for Mr. Daibes said he was confident his client would be exonerated of the charges. A lawyer for Mr. Uribe could not immediately be identified.
In response to growing calls for his resignation, Mr. Menendez issued a new statement late Friday.
"It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat," he said. "I am not going anywhere."

Does Bob Menendez Have Enough Teflon to Survive Again?

In a state long attuned to the drumbeat of political corruption — salacious charges, furious denials, explosive trials — Sen. Bob Menendez has often registered as the quintessential New Jersey politician.
He successfully avoided charges in one case, and after federal prosecutors indicted him in another, he got off after a mistrial in 2017. “To those who were digging my political grave,” Menendez warned then with characteristic bravado, “I know who you are and I won’t forget you.”
Six years later, he is once again on the brink, battling for his political life after federal prosecutors in New York unsealed a jarring new indictment Friday charging the powerful Democratic senator and his wife in a garish bribery scheme involving a foreign power, piles of cash and gold bars.
A defiant Menendez, 69, immediately vowed to clear his name from what he cast as just more smears by vengeful prosecutors. A top adviser said that he would also continue running for reelection in 2024, when he is trying to secure a fourth full term.
But as details of the case quickly spread through Trenton, New Jersey, and Washington — including images of an allegedly ill-begotten Mercedes-Benz convertible and cash bribes hidden in closets — it was clear Menendez may be confronting the gravest political challenge in a career that started 49 years ago in the shadow of New York City.
By Saturday afternoon, nearly every major Democratic figure in the state had called on him to resign, including the governor, senior members of Congress and influential state and county party chairs. It was a dramatic contrast to 2015, when Democrats largely rallied around Menendez in the face of his first indictment.
Party strategists and elected officials were already openly speculating that one or more of a group of ambitious, young Democrats representing the state in Congress could mount a primary campaign against him. One of them, Rep. Andy Kim, declared his candidacy on social media Saturday afternoon, setting up a highly unusual showdown.
“Not something I expected to do, but NJ deserves better,” he wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “We cannot jeopardize the Senate or compromise our integrity.”
For now, Menendez appeared to be on firmer footing among his colleagues in the Senate, notably including Sen. Cory Booker, his fellow New Jersey Democrat, who had not commented publicly. They accepted his temporary resignation as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee but did not ask him to leave office.
In a statement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, called Menendez “a dedicated public servant” and said that his colleague had “a right to due process and a fair trial.”
Calls for his ouster seemed to only embolden Menendez, who spent part of Friday afternoon trying to rally allies by phone. “It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat,” he wrote in a fiery retort to Democrats who broke with him. “I am not going anywhere.”
His campaign did not immediately comment on Kim’s announcement.
The electoral stakes were high, and not just for Menendez.
Although he had yet to formally answer the charges in court, some party strategists were gauging the possibility that Menendez could be scheduled to stand trial in the middle of the campaign — an unwelcome distraction for Democratic candidates across the nation.
Republicans were already using the indictment to attack the party. “Democrats covered for Menendez the first time he got indicted for corruption,” said Philip Letsou, a spokesperson for the Senate Republican campaign committee. “It would be a shame if they did so again.”
Democrats have not lost a Senate race in New Jersey since the 1970s. But allowing Menendez to stay in office could at the least force the party to spend heavily there at a time when it faces daunting odds of retaining a razor-thin majority. Some party officials worried it could also dampen Democrats’ performance in competitive New Jersey legislative races this fall.
“I understand personal loyalty, and I understand the depths of friendships, but somebody needs to take a stand here,” said Robert Torricelli, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey. “This is not about him — it’s about holding the majority.”
Torricelli speaks from experience. He retired rather than seek reelection in 2002 after his own ethics scandal ended without charges. He was also widely believed to be a target of Menendez’s ire after the former senator put his hand up to succeed Menendez had he been convicted in 2017.
“In the history of the United States Congress, it is doubtful there has ever been a corruption allegation of this depth and seriousness,” Torricelli added. “The degree of the evidence. The gold bars and the hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash. It’s incomprehensible.”
The details laid out in the 39-page indictment were nothing short of tawdry. Prosecutors said that Menendez had used his position to provide sensitive government information to Egypt, browbeat the Department of Agriculture and tamper with a criminal investigation. In exchange, associates rewarded him with the gold bullion, a car and cash, along with home mortgage payments and other benefits, they said.
Prosecutors referred to a text between an Egyptian general and an Egyptian American businessperson in which Menendez was referred to as “our man.” At one point, prosecutors said, the senator searched in a web browser “how much is one kilo of gold worth.”
Menendez is far from the first elected official in New Jersey to face serious criminal allegations. With a long tradition of one-party rule, a bare-knuckle political culture and an unusual patchwork of governmental fiefs, the state has been a hotbed for corruption that has felled city councilors, mayors, state legislators and members of Congress.
The Washington Post tried to quantify the criminality in 2015 and found that New Jersey’s rate of crime per politician easily led any other state.
Menendez already has a Democratic primary opponent, Kyle Jasey, a real estate lender and first-time candidate who called the indictment an “embarrassment for our state.” But political strategists and elected Democrats said Jasey may not have the lane to himself for long.
New Jersey has a glut of Democratic members of Congress with outsize national profiles; it took barely minutes Friday for the state’s political class to begin speculating about who might step forward.

Mikie Sherrill, 51, and Josh Gottheimer, 48, moderates who were already said to be looking at statewide campaigns for governor in 2025, when Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, cannot run because of term limits. Other names included Tom Malinowski, a two-term congressman who lost his seat last year.
National Republicans put their focus on Christine Serrano Glassner, the two-term mayor of a small community roughly 25 miles west of Newark, who quickly branded her opponent “Gold Bar Bob.”

Hana would agree to put her on the payroll of his halal meat company if Bob Menendez could promise to help facilitate more sales of military equipment to Egypt, prosecutors said.
At the time, the issue was a high priority for the Egyptian government because the U.S. State Department had been withholding some military aid until the country could show improvements on human rights. As the ranking member — and soon-to-be chair — of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez exerted significant influence over how much military aid the United States supplied to Egypt and other countries.
Menendez shared with his girlfriend sensitive information from the State Department about the number and nationalities of people working at the U.S. embassy in Cairo; she passed it to Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official, prosecutors said. Bob Menendez also agreed to ghostwrite a letter from an Egyptian official who wished to urge the U.S. Senate for more military aid to Egypt.
In July 2018, after meetings between Menendez and Egyptian officials, he texted Nadine Menendez to tell Hana that he was going to sign off on a multimillion-dollar weapons sale to Egypt. She forwarded the text to Hana, who sent it to two Egyptian officials, one of whom replied with a thumbs-up emoji.
Hana and his business associate, Jose Uribe, then saw another opening to use Bob Menendez, prosecutors said. They knew that Nadine Menendez had recently gotten into a car accident and needed a car, so they offered to buy the couple a new Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible, worth more than $60,000.
In exchange, they asked Bob Menendez to interfere in an ongoing prosecution and criminal investigation involving Uribe’s business associates. Uribe, 56, who worked in the trucking and insurance industries, had been previously convicted of fraud.
In early 2019, Menendez contacted a senior prosecutor at the New Jersey attorney general’s office who was supervising the cases and pressured him to resolve them favorably for the defendants, the indictment said. The prosecutor did not agree to intervene, but one of the cases ultimately resulted in a plea deal with no jail time. In the other, no charges were ever brought.
A few days after Menendez called the prosecutor, Nadine Menendez texted Hana: “All is GREAT! I’m so excited to get a car next week.”
She met Uribe in a parking lot of a restaurant, where he gave her about $15,000 in cash. She made the down payment on her new Mercedes the next day. “You are a miracle worker who makes dreams come true I will always remember that,” she texted Uribe.
But about this time, a problem arose. Hana’s halal meat company, IS EG Halal Certified, had little to no revenue. Nadine Menendez, who prosecutors said had been given a “low- or no-show job” there, started to complain to Hana’s business associates that she wasn’t getting paid. She texted Menendez about how upset she was about Hana’s broken promises.
A major break came in the spring of 2019. The Egyptian government gave Hana’s company a monopoly over certifying American food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards, in adherence with Islamic law. Hana’s company, despite its name, had no experience with halal certification.
A huge financial windfall was coming.
The day after an Egyptian official informed Hana that his company was most likely going to become the sole halal certifier for U.S. imports, Nadine Menendez texted the senator: “Seems like halal went through. It might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around.” The indictment did not say if Bob Menendez used his position to influence Egypt’s decision.
Soon afterward, Nadine Menendez created a consulting company, Strategic International Business Consultants, which prosecutors said was used to receive tens of thousands of dollars in bribe payments.
Hana’s monopoly, however, increased costs for some U.S. meat suppliers, which did not escape the notice of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In the spring of 2019, USDA officials asked Egypt to reconsider the monopoly rights for halal certification, which had previously been granted to a handful of companies.
At Hana’s request, Bob Menendez called a high-level USDA official and asked them to stop opposing the monopoly, prosecutors said. The official did not acquiesce to Menendez’s demands, but Hana still kept sole control over the Egyptian certification.
Two months later, prosecutors said, Hana used his halal company to pay about $23,000 to Nadine Menendez to help her stay current on her mortgage while she was in foreclosure proceedings.
Still, prosecutors suggested, she felt she deserved more money for all the help that her boyfriend was giving Hana, especially after the senator had agreed to meet with some senior Egyptian officials. She texted Menendez: “I am soooooo upset.”
She wanted to complain to one of Hana’s business associates, but Menendez warned her: “No, you should not text or email.” She placed a call instead. The next day, Hana’s halal company wired $10,000 to her consulting firm.
As their scheme expanded, prosecutors said, they deleted more and more texts and emails.
A few months after the couple married in October 2020, Bob Menendez met with Philip Sellinger, a potential candidate to be nominated for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, the top federal prosecutor in the state.
This time, the indictment said, Menendez was carrying out his end of another corrupt bargain. In the meeting, he criticized the ongoing case against Fred Daibes, who was indicted in 2018 by federal prosecutors in New Jersey. He also happened to be a business associate of Hana’s and a longtime fundraiser for Menendez.
When Sellinger said he might have to recuse himself from the investigation anyway because of a prior conflict of interest, Menendez said he would not be recommending him for U.S. attorney, according to the indictment.
Ultimately, Menendez did recommend Sellinger for the nomination, believing that he could influence the investigation if Sellinger held that post, prosecutors said. The indictment did not say why Menendez believed that.
In early 2022, Menendez placed two phone calls to the federal prosecutor overseeing Daibes’ case. Minutes after the second call, Menendez called Daibes directly.
Two months later, Nadine Menendez ate lunch with Daibes and texted him afterward: “THANK YOU Fred,” with a slew of emoji. The next day, she met with a jeweler who was friends with Daibes and sold the jeweler two gold bars that prosecutors believe were previously owned by Daibes, worth about $120,000 at the time.
The New Jersey U.S. attorney’s office did not bend to the pressure campaign, the indictment said. Daibes pleaded guilty in April 2022.
But the unraveling for the Menendezes would soon begin.
In June 2022, federal agents raided the Menendezes’ home. Some of the envelopes containing the wads of cash had the fingerprints and DNA of Daibes and his driver — marked with Daibes’ return address, prosecutors said.
After the search, Uribe stopped making the monthly payments on the Mercedes convertible. Bob Menendez wrote his wife a check for $23,000, part of which she gave to Uribe with the memo line: “personal loan.” The indictment did not make clear what the purpose of the payment was.
It was too late.
On Friday, Bob Menendez was indicted on three federal charges and temporarily stepped down from his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The indictment also charged his wife, Hana, Uribe and Daibes.
A lawyer for Daibes said he was confident his client would be exonerated of the charges. A lawyer for Uribe could not immediately be identified.
In response to growing calls for his resignation, Menendez issued a new statement late Friday.
“It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat,” he said. “I am not going anywhere.”

Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was charged Friday with taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including bars of gold bullion, to wield his power abroad and at home.
The three-count federal indictment depicts a brazen plan hatched during furtive dinners, in text messages and on encrypted calls — much of it aimed at increasing U.S. assistance to Egypt and aiding businessmen in New Jersey.
Menendez’s wife, Nadine, is accused of acting as a go-between, passing messages to an American Egyptian businessman, Wael Hana, who maintained close connections with Egyptian military and intelligence officials, the indictment said. In one text, to an Egyptian general, Hana referred to the senator, who held sway over military sales, financing and other aid, as “our man.”
Menendez, in a strongly worded rebuke to prosecutors, said he was confident the matter would be “successfully resolved once all of the facts are presented.”
Friday’s charges depict an intermingling of the bare-knuckle, backroom dealings of Menendez’s home state of New Jersey and delicate matters of security in the Middle East. They represent the latest episode in a decadeslong political career that took Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, from the Union City, New Jersey, school board to the halls of the Senate, a career marked by accusations of corruption and an earlier federal indictment that ended in a hung jury.
The new charges threaten Menendez’s vast political power, as well as his freedom.
New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy, a close Democratic ally, called on Menendez to resign, an admonition that unleashed a torrent of similar messages from political leaders throughout the state. Menendez insisted that he would not heed them. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said in a statement Friday evening.
Menendez did send a letter to Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Senate majority leader, informing him that he was stepping down as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, as required by rules the Senate Democrats adopted to govern themselves.
The corruption scheme, according to the indictment, extended beyond foreign aid. Menendez is accused of using his position to influence criminal investigations of two other New Jersey businessmen, one of whom was a longtime fundraiser for Menendez.
Toward that end, the senator recommended that President Joe Biden nominate a lawyer, Philip Sellinger, to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey because Menendez believed he could influence Sellinger’s prosecution of the fundraiser, the indictment said. Sellinger, who was ultimately confirmed for the post, did not bend, prosecutors said.
Menendez is also accused of meddling in an investigation by the New Jersey attorney general’s office, using “advice and pressure” in an attempt to persuade a senior prosecutor to go easy in the case of two associates of a man who gave Nadine Menendez a Mercedes-Benz convertible. The prosecutor considered Bob Menendez’s actions “inappropriate and did not agree to intervene,” according to the indictment.
In exchange for all those actions, the indictment said, the senator and his wife accepted cash, gold, payments toward a home mortgage, the luxury car and other valuable things. The day after a trip to Egypt in 2021, the indictment said, Menendez asked in an internet query “how much is 1 kilo of gold worth.”
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference announcing the charges that Menendez’s actions were meant to serve a favored few.
The prosecutor said Menendez’s Senate website explicitly detailed the kinds of services he would not provide because they would be improper, among them influencing private business matters and intervening in judicial issues and criminal trials.
“Constituent service is part of any legislator’s job — Sen. Menendez is no different,” Williams said. But, he added, “Behind the scenes, Sen. Menendez was doing those things for certain people — the people who were bribing him and his wife.”
Soon after the news conference, Menendez issued an angry page-long denunciation of the charges, blaming them on unnamed “forces behind the scenes” that have “repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave.”
“The excesses of these prosecutors is apparent,” he added. “They have misrepresented the normal work of a congressional office. On top of that, not content with making false claims against me, they have attacked my wife for the long-standing friendships she had before she and I even met.”
Nadine Menendez’s lawyer, David Schertler, said his client had broken no laws.
“Mrs. Menendez denies any criminal conduct and will vigorously contest these charges in court,” Schertler said.
The charges against Bob Menendez, 69, and the others follow a lengthy investigation by the FBI and federal prosecutors in the New York City borough of Manhattan, and they come nearly six years after his trial on unrelated claims of corruption ended with a hung jury.
James Smith, who heads the New York FBI office, said Friday that the conduct detailed in the indictment “damages the public’s faith in our system of government and brings undue scorn to the honest and dedicated public servants who carry out their duties on a daily basis.”
The businessmen named in the indictment, which was unsealed in Manhattan federal court, are Hana, a longtime friend of Nadine Menendez’s and who founded a halal meat certification business; Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer and fundraiser for Bob Menendez; and Jose Uribe, who works in trucking and insurance.
The 39-page indictment charged the senator, his wife and the businessmen with conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. It also charges the Menendezes with conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official right, meaning that they used his official position to force someone to give them something of value.
According to the indictment, Nadine Menendez at one point bragged that her actions would make Hana “more powerful than the president of Egypt.”
In 2018, Nadine Menendez, 56, and Hana arranged meetings and dinners with Egyptian officials and Bob Menendez, whom she had just begun dating. There, the Egyptian officials made requests related to foreign military sales and financing, among other things. In return for Menendez’s promise that he would facilitate such sales, the indictment said, Hana promised to put Nadine Menendez on his payroll in a job where she would perform little or no work.
After one meeting with Egyptian officials, Bob Menendez obtained from the State Department nonpublic information about the number and nationality of people serving at the U.S. Embassy in Egypt, the indictment said. It notes that such information is highly sensitive and its disclosure could threaten security.
Bob Menendez texted the information to Nadine Menendez, who forwarded the message to Hana. He then sent it to an Egyptian official, the indictment said.
At a dinner about the same time, Menendez disclosed to Hana other nonpublic information about U.S. military aid, the indictment said. Shortly after, Hana texted another Egyptian official: “The ban on small arms and ammunition to Egypt has been lifted. That means sales can begin. That will include sniper rifles among other articles.”
The indictment also showed the cozy relationship that Nadine Menendez and Hana fostered between her husband and Egyptian officials. Once, the indictment said, Bob Menendez met in his Senate office with her, Hana and an Egyptian intelligence official to discuss a human rights matter that had been affecting aid to the country.
Later that evening, the group headed to a steakhouse in Washington for dinner.
Hana started operating his company, IS EG Halal, in 2019, and within a year the Egyptian government had made it the sole entity authorized to certify that halal meat imported to Egypt from anywhere in the world had been prepared according to Islamic law.
When a “high-level” official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture argued that the monopoly harmed U.S. interests, Bob Menendez called the official and insisted “that the USDA stop opposing IS EG Halal’s status as sole halal certifier,” the indictment said.
The halal company provided revenue from which Hana “could make good on the bribe payments he had promised,” the indictment said.
Hana also received assistance from Daibes and Uribe, the other businessmen charged in the case, in providing payments to Nadine Menendez.
At one point in 2019, Nadine Menendez complained to her husband that she had not received a check she expected.
“I am soooooo upset,” she texted Menendez, adding that Hana had not left her an envelope. She asked whether she should text Daibes, but the senator responded, “No, you should not text or email.”
Shortly thereafter, she called Daibes, and Hana’s company issued a $10,000 check to a consulting firm run by her.
During a search of the couple’s home in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, and a safe deposit box in Nadine Menendez’s name, investigators found $550,000 in cash, much of it hidden in clothing, closets and a safe. Some cash was stuffed in envelopes that contained the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes or his driver, who was not named.
Investigators also found more than $100,000 worth of gold bars, some of which were featured in photographs in the indictment.
Hana’s spokesperson said that, based on an initial review of the charges, “they have absolutely no merit.”
Daibes’ lawyer, Tim Donohue, said he was confident that Daibes would be “completely exonerated of all charges.”
A representative for Uribe could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Menendezes and their three co-defendants are expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the Southern District.
The charges are not the senator’s first encounter with the law. In 2015, he was indicted in New Jersey on bribery charges in what federal prosecutors called a scheme between the senator and a wealthy eye doctor to trade political favors for gifts worth close to $1 million, including luxury vacations in the Caribbean and campaign contributions. Menendez’s corruption trial ended in a mistrial in November 2017, after the jury said it was unable to reach a verdict.
The judge later acquitted Menendez of several charges and the Justice Department dismissed the others.
Friday’s indictment resounded anew in Washington and in New Jersey, as members of the party and Congress called for Menendez to step down. However, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a close ally of Menendez’s, remained silent about the accusations and the calls for resignation.
Menendez is already facing at least one Democratic challenger in his planned run for reelection to a fourth Senate term, and the Republican mayor of Mendham Borough, New Jersey, has also announced that she will compete for the seat.
If Menendez were to quit, as Murphy has suggested, the governor would name a successor.
“These are serious charges that implicate national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system,” Murphy said in a statement.
“The alleged facts are so serious,” he added, “that they compromise the ability of Sen. Menendez to effectively represent the people of our state.”

Mr. Hana also received assistance from Mr. Daibes and Mr. Uribe, the other businessmen charged in the case, in providing payments to Ms. Menendez.
At one point in 2019, Ms. Menendez complained to her husband that she had not received a check she expected.
"I am soooooo upset," she texted Mr. Menendez, adding that Mr. Hana had not left her an envelope. She asked whether she should text Mr. Daibes, but the senator responded, "No, you should not text or email."
Shortly thereafter, Ms. Menendez called Mr. Daibes, and Mr. Hana's company issued a $ 10,000 check to a consulting firm run by Ms. Menendez.
During a search of the couple's home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and a safe deposit box in Ms. Menendez's name, investigators found $ 550,000 in cash, much of it hidden in clothing, closets and a safe. Some cash was stuffed in envelopes that contained the fingerprints or DNA of Mr. Daibes or his driver, who was not named.
Investigators also found more than $ 100,000 worth of gold bars, some of which were featured in photographs in the indictment.
Mr. Hana's spokeswoman said that, based on an initial review of the charges, "they have absolutely no merit."
Mr. Daibes's lawyer, Tim Donohue, said that he was confident that Mr. Daibes would be "completely exonerated of all charges."
A representative for Mr. Uribe could not immediately be reached for comment.
Mr. Menendez, his wife and their three co-defendants are expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the Southern District.
The charges are not the senator's first encounter with the law. In 2015, Mr. Menendez was indicted in New Jersey on bribery charges in what federal prosecutors called a scheme between the senator and a wealthy eye doctor to trade political favors for gifts worth close to $ 1 million, including luxury vacations in the Caribbean and campaign contributions. Mr. Menendez's corruption trial ended in a mistrial in November 2017, after the jury said it was unable to reach a verdict.
The judge later acquitted Mr. Menendez of several charges and the Justice Department dismissed the others.
Friday's indictment resounded anew in Washington and in New Jersey, as members of the party and Congress called for Mr. Menendez to step down. However, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a close ally of Mr. Menendez's, remained silent about the accusations and the calls for resignation.
Mr. Menendez is already facing at least one Democratic challenger in his planned run for re-election to a fourth Senate term, and the Republican mayor of Mendham Borough, N.J., has also announced that she will compete for the seat.
If Mr. Menendez were to quit, as Mr. Murphy has suggested, the governor would name a successor.
"These are serious charges that implicate national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system," Mr. Murphy said in a statement.
"The alleged facts are so serious," he added, "that they compromise the ability of Senator Menendez to effectively represent the people of our state."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Robert Menendez and four others were charged after a lengthy investigation led by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey faces new federal corruption charges, almost six years after a trial on unrelated claims of bribery ended with a hung jury.
A 39-page indictment unsealed Friday accused Mr. Menendez of accepting thousands of dollars worth of bribes in exchange for using his power to influence a wide range of corrupt schemes at home and abroad.
The three-count indictment charged Mr. Menendez, a Democrat who leads the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, with sharing "highly sensitive" information about people assigned to the United States Embassy in Egypt and taking other steps that "secretly aided the Government of Egypt."
In a strongly worded, page-long statement, Mr. Menendez said he was confident that the matter would be "successfully resolved once all of the facts are presented and my fellow New Jerseyans will see this for what it is."
He said forces "behind the scenes" had "attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave."
"Those behind this campaign simply cannot accept that a first-generation Latino-American from humble beginnings could rise to be a U.S. senator and serve with honor and distinction," he added. "Even worse, they see me as an obstacle in the way of their broader political goals."
He said later on Friday he would step down as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee.
The indictment also names Nadine Menendez, Mr. Menendez's wife; Fred Daibes, a prominent builder who helped rehabilitate New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront; Wael Hana, the founder of a halal meat certification company with headquarters in New Jersey; and Jose Uribe, a former insurance agent from Union City, N.J.
Ms. Menendez's lawyer, David Schertler, said his client "denies any criminal conduct and will vigorously contest these charges in court."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Hana said the charges had "absolutely no merit."
Mr. Daibes's lawyer, Tim Donohue, said he was confident that Mr. Daibes would be "completely exonerated of all charges."
A lawyer for Mr. Uribe could not immediately be identified.
Here is a closer look at the people at the center of the case.
Robert Menendez
Mr. Menendez, 69, is a political survivor. The son of Cuban immigrants, he rose to prominence in Union City, a small, densely populated community in Hudson County, N.J., a region known for its bare-knuckle politics.
He now lives in Bergen County with Ms. Menendez, his wife of three years.
They met at one of his favorite haunts, an IHOP in Union City, a city he represented as mayor, in the State Legislature and in the House of Representatives before being elected to the Senate.
Mr. Menendez has been preparing to run for a fourth Senate term, and there are no indications that the indictment will change that plan.
He operates best under pressure, former aides have said.
He has had plenty of practice.
As a young man, he wore a bulletproof vest into federal court to testify against a onetime mentor, William V. Musto, then the mayor of Union City. Mr. Musto was convicted of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from a contractor hired to build schools.
Soon after being sworn in to the Senate, he faced a federal inquiry led by Chris Christie, then the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, over payments by a nonprofit group that rented a house he owned. It went nowhere, but shadowed him for nearly six years.
In 2015, he stepped down as the lead Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee after being charged with trading political favors for luxury vacations, golf outings, campaign donations and expensive flights.
A nine-week trial in 2017 ended with a hung jury, and the Justice Department declined to retry him after a judge dismissed the most serious corruption charges.
Still, he was formally admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee, and had a closer-than-expected primary race against a largely unknown Democratic challenger. But he went on to beat his Republican opponent handily in November 2018.
Nadine Menendez
Ms. Menendez, 56, got engaged to the senator in October 2019 after a whirlwind courtship; they married a year later in a small ceremony in Queens.
Ms. Menendez, who speaks several languages and has a master's degree in French from New York University, started an international consulting company in June 2019.
A law firm run by a longtime friend of Mr. Menendez filed the incorporation papers for the company, Strategic International Business Consultants, on the same day that a lender began foreclosure proceedings on the split-level home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where she and Mr. Menendez now live, according to state records and court filings.
By the next year, her finances had rebounded.
Mr. Menendez reported on Senate disclosure forms that in 2020 his wife owned bars of gold bullion worth as much as $ 250,000.
Federal records show that the couple recently sold the bullion for as much as $ 400,000, a sum that would be the equivalent of roughly 14 pounds of gold.
Fred Daibes
Mr. Daibes, 66, a prominent real estate developer based in Edgewater, N.J., lived in a Palestinian refugee camp for 10 years before emigrating to the United States as a child.
He worked his way up from washing dishes in a New Jersey restaurant to acquiring wealth so vast that in 2013 several people were charged with beating him and stealing millions of dollars worth of gold and jewelry from his penthouse apartment, court records show.
Five years later, Mr. Daibes was charged with a bank fraud scheme in a 14-count federal indictment. Last year, he pleaded guilty to a single count of making false entries in connection with a loan document.
Prosecutors said it was part of a scheme by which he obtained the proceeds of an insider loan from Mariner's Bank, which he founded and where he had served as chairman. The $ 1.8 million loan was paid back, and the plea agreement, approved by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, did not call for prison time.
Mr. Daibes's sentencing has been delayed four times, most recently in July.
While awaiting sentencing, the judge granted Mr. Daibes permission to travel to London and Qatar to meet with potential lenders for a real estate project at 115 River Road in Edgewater, which had lost its financing after getting bogged down in a delayed environmental cleanup, court records show.
The trips paid off.
In January, he finalized a $ 45 million shared-ownership agreement for the Edgewater project with a company founded by a member of Qatar's royal family, Bergen County deed records show.
Wael Hana
Mr. Hana, 40, has known Ms. Menendez since before she began dating the senator. They socialized together at restaurants in Bergen County, N.J., with a small circle of friends, according to members of the group.
In the spring of 2019, Mr. Hana, a United States citizen born in Egypt, began operating a halal meat certification company in New Jersey, even though he said in court documents that he had no experience in the industry.
By January 2020, the company, IS EG Halal, was the sole entity authorized by the Egyptian government to certify that any halal food product imported into Egypt from anywhere in the world had been prepared according to Islamic law.
The arrangement did not require the approval of the United States, according to the Department of Agriculture. But it meant that four U.S.-based halal meat certification companies that for years had shared the work lost the business overnight.
In November 2019, federal agents searched Mr. Hana's home and office, seizing computers, cellphones, paperwork and jewelry, according to legal papers his lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, filed to retrieve the items.
IS EG Halal operates from a small building overlooking the Hudson River in Edgewater, in a building owned by a company run by Mr. Daibes. Mr. Daibes also has an office in the building.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Hana has said that he won the halal certification contract without any help from Mr. Menendez or any other U.S. official.
Jose Uribe
Mr. Uribe, a friend of Mr. Hana's, lost his insurance broker's license after being convicted of fraud in New Jersey, where he was accused of taking $ 77,000 in premiums from seven clients but failing to purchase the insurance.
He then entered the trucking industry, according to the indictment.
He is charged with providing Ms. Menendez with a luxury car, a Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible, in exchange for Mr. Menendez intervening with the state attorney general's office on behalf of Mr. Uribe's associate, who also faced criminal prosecution in New Jersey.
Mr. Menendez contacted a senior state prosecutor, according to the indictment, "in an attempt, through advice and pressure," to "resolve these matters favorably."

The Rising Costs of Owning a Car: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Everything is going up -- buying, financing, insurance and maintenance. The average annual cost of ownership, by one estimate, is $ 12,000.
It's getting more expensive to own and operate a new car.
The average annual cost of ownership is up more than 13 percent from last year to more than $ 12,000, or just over $ 1,000 a month, according to the latest research from the automobile owners group AAA. Higher car prices and the surging costs of financing, insuring and maintaining a new car all contributed to the increase. The analysis also considered depreciation a cost even though it's not paid out of pocket.
Where does that leave consumers who are already squeezed by rising gas prices, the higher costs for food and other goods, as well as increasing interest rates on their credit cards?
Drivers should consider their true needs and driving habits when choosing a vehicle, said Greg Brannon, director of automotive research for AAA. "It's really up to your specific situation."
The average cost per mile for a vehicle driven 15,000 miles a year is about 81 cents, AAA says. But it's $ 1.06 for a popular half-ton pickup truck like a Chevrolet Silverado. If you need a truck only occasionally to haul mulch from the garden center, it might make sense to buy a smaller car -- say, a compact sport utility vehicle like a Nissan Rogue -- at about 67 cents per mile and rent a truck when you really need one.
"It's very expensive to own a pickup that you only use as a pickup once or twice a year," Mr. Brannon said.
The cheapest option is a small sedan, at about 60 cents a mile, AAA found. For shoppers, however, it may be challenging to find lower-priced sedans on dealer lots, said Benjamin Preston, an automotive reporter at Consumer Reports. That's because automakers have been emphasizing production of more profitable models, like big S.U.V.s and trucks with lots of extra features, he said.
While new car inventories are improving, Mr. Preston said, "if you're looking for an affordable car, it's a tough time." If you can wait a few months for delivery, you can order the specific model you want -- without extra bells and whistles -- through a dealer, he said.
While used car prices have moderated, Mr. Preston said, higher interest rates, particularly for older, lower-priced models, may make them more expensive to buy. According to Experian Automotive, which tracks automobile financing, the average interest rate for a used car loan rose to 11.38 percent from 8.84 percent last year, while the average payment rose to $ 528 from $ 519.
According to an analysis from iSeeCars.com, an online car search site, buyers with a $ 23,000 budget could buy a three-year-old car in 2019, but the same amount is not enough for the average six-year-old car today.
If you do choose an older used car, Mr. Preston said -- five years old or more -- keep in mind that it is unlikely to be covered by a manufacturer's warranty. So choose a model with a history of reliability and have a mechanic check it out before buying.
The average price of the new cars included in AAA's 2023 study, based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price, is about $ 35,000, up 4.7 percent from last year, while the average annual finance charge almost doubled, to $ 1,253, AAA found. The report projects new cars will depreciate by an average of $ 4,538 per year over five years of ownership, up 24 percent over 2022.
(The higher depreciation reflects the slipping used car prices and high new car prices. "You pay more, but it's worth less," Mr. Brannon of AAA said.)
The report, based on information from the automotive data researcher Vincentric and other sources, used the five most popular 2023 models in nine categories, excluding luxury cars. It estimates the cost of using a new car over five years and 75,000 miles, considering costs for fuel and maintenance, insurance, license and registration fees, taxes, and depreciation. It doesn't include the cost of parking, which can add hundreds or thousands of dollars to the cost of car ownership if you live in a big city.
Other analyses show new-car prices to be even higher. Kelley Blue Book, a unit of Cox Automotive, said the average transaction price for a new car -- what buyers actually pay -- was about $ 48,500 in August, roughly flat with a year earlier, held in check by growing inventories and incentives like cash-back rebates. (Kelley's figure includes luxury cars, like those from Audi and Mercedes-Benz, which have raised prices.)
One unknown is the possible effect on car prices of the United Automobile Workers strike. The strike isn't expected to affect consumer prices in the near term, according to Cox Automotive, but prices could rise if the strike lasts long enough to affect the supply of new vehicles.
Here are some questions and answers about managing car costs:
What are current interest rates on new car loans?
The average interest rate for a new-car loan rose to 6.63 percent in the second quarter this year from 4.6 percent a year earlier, according to Experian Automotive. More borrowers are choosing shorter-term loans, said Melinda Zabritski, head of automotive finance insights at Experian, because shoppers can usually get lower rates on shorter-term loans, and because carmakers are offering extra incentives on those loans. A shorter loan reduces the overall expense but increases the size of monthly payments.
The average monthly new-car payment rose to $ 729 from $ 672 in the second quarter. Maintaining a good credit score can help you get a better rate on your car loan.
My auto insurance premium is increasing. What can I do?
Car insurance costs are rising as insurers face higher losses for accidents, repairs and natural disasters. In some cases, according to the consumer research firm J.D. Power, drivers are skipping coverage, even though most states require minimum coverage, because they can't afford premiums. The number of households with at least one car that said they didn't have auto insurance rose to 5.7 percent in the first half of 2023, from 5.3 percent in the second half of 2022. (J.D. Power said it did not have data for first half of 2022.)
Drivers should get quotes from several insurers and ask what steps they can take to lower their costs, the company said, such as raising their deductibles -- the amount of a claim they must pay out of pocket.
What about going carless?
As car ownership becomes more costly, you may want to consider if you can get by without one, especially if you live in an urban area with good public transportation or wide availability of ride-sharing services. Zipcar, a unit of Avis Budget Group, says members can save thousands of dollars annually by using its self-service car rentals.

Menendez Accused of Brazen Bribery Plot, Taking Cash and Gold

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was charged Friday with taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including bars of gold bullion, to wield his power abroad and at home.
The three-count federal indictment depicts a brazen plan hatched during furtive dinners, in text messages and on encrypted calls — much of it aimed at increasing U.S. assistance to Egypt and aiding businessmen in New Jersey.
Menendez’s wife, Nadine, is accused of acting as a go-between, passing messages to an American Egyptian businessman, Wael Hana, who maintained close connections with Egyptian military and intelligence officials, the indictment said. In one text, to an Egyptian general, Hana referred to the senator, who held sway over military sales, financing and other aid, as “our man.”
Menendez, in a strongly worded rebuke to prosecutors, said he was confident the matter would be “successfully resolved once all of the facts are presented.”
Friday’s charges depict an intermingling of the bare-knuckle, backroom dealings of Menendez’s home state of New Jersey and delicate matters of security in the Middle East. They represent the latest episode in a decadeslong political career that took Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, from the Union City, New Jersey, school board to the halls of the Senate, a career marked by accusations of corruption and an earlier federal indictment that ended in a hung jury.
The new charges threaten Menendez’s vast political power, as well as his freedom.
Early Friday evening, New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy, a close Democratic ally, called on Menendez to resign, an admonition that unleashed a torrent of similar messages from political leaders throughout the state.
Not long beforehand, Menendez sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., informing him that he was stepping down as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, as required by rules the Senate Democrats adopted to govern themselves.
“Bob Menendez has been a dedicated public servant and is always fighting hard for the people of New Jersey,” Schumer said in a statement. “He has a right to due process and a fair trial.”
The corruption scheme, according to the indictment, extended beyond foreign aid. Menendez is accused of using his official position to influence criminal investigations of two other New Jersey businessmen, one of whom was a longtime fundraiser for Menendez.
Toward that end, the senator recommended that President Joe Biden nominate a lawyer, Philip Sellinger, to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey because Menendez believed he could influence Sellinger’s prosecution of the fundraiser, the indictment said. Sellinger, who was ultimately confirmed for the post, did not bend, prosecutors said.
Menendez is also accused of meddling in an investigation by the New Jersey attorney general’s office, using “advice and pressure” in an attempt to persuade a senior prosecutor to go easy in the case of two associates of a man who later gave Nadine Menendez a Mercedes-Benz convertible. The prosecutor considered Bob Menendez’s actions “inappropriate and did not agree to intervene,” according to the indictment.
In exchange for all those actions, the indictment said, the Menendezes accepted cash, gold, payments toward a home mortgage, the luxury car and other valuable things. The day after a trip to Egypt in 2021, the indictment said, Bob Menendez asked in an internet query “how much is one kilo of gold worth.”
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference announcing the charges that Menendez’s actions were meant to serve a favored few.
The prosecutor said Menendez’s Senate website explicitly detailed the kinds of services he would not provide because they would be improper, among them influencing private business matters and intervening in judicial issues and criminal trials.
“Constituent service is part of any legislator’s job — Sen. Menendez is no different,” Williams said. But, he added, “Behind the scenes, Sen. Menendez was doing those things for certain people — the people who were bribing him and his wife.”
Soon after the news conference, Menendez issued an angry page-long denunciation of the charges, blaming them on unnamed “forces behind the scenes” that have “repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave.”
“The excesses of these prosecutors is apparent,” he added. “They have misrepresented the normal work of a Congressional office. On top of that, not content with making false claims against me, they have attacked my wife for the long-standing friendships she had before she and I even met.”
Nadine Menendez’s lawyer, David Schertler, said his client broken no laws.
“Mrs. Menendez denies any criminal conduct and will vigorously contest these charges in court,” Schertler said.
The charges against Bob Menendez, 69, and the others follow a lengthy investigation by the FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, and they come nearly six years after his trial on unrelated claims of corruption ended with a hung jury.
James Smith, who heads the New York FBI office, said Friday that the conduct that was detailed in the indictment “damages the public’s faith in our system of government and brings undue scorn to the honest and dedicated public servants who carry out their duties on a daily basis.”
The businessmen named in the indictment, which was unsealed in Manhattan federal court, are Hana, a longtime friend of Nadine Menendez’s who founded a halal meat certification business; Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer and fundraiser for Bob Menendez; and Jose Uribe, who works in trucking and insurance.
Daibes, 66, who pleaded guilty last year to making false entries in connection with a $1.8 million loan document, is among a small group of New Jersey builders responsible for converting parts of the polluted Hudson River waterfront into a bustling hive of residential and commercial activity.
The 39-page indictment charges the Menendezes and the businessmen with conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. It also charges the Menendezes with conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official right, meaning that they used his official position to force someone to give them something of value.
According to the indictment, Nadine Menendez at one point bragged that her actions would make Hana “more powerful than the president of Egypt.”
In 2018, Nadine Menendez, 56, and Hana arranged meetings and dinners with Egyptian officials and Bob Menendez, whom she had just begun dating. During the meetings, the Egyptian officials raised requests related to foreign military sales and financing, among other things. In return for Bob Menendez’s promise that he would use his authority to facilitate such sales, the indictment says, Hana promised to put Nadine Menendez on the payroll of his company in a job for which she would perform little or no work.
After one meeting with Egyptian officials, Bob Menendez asked for and obtained from the State Department nonpublic information regarding the number and nationality of people serving at the U.S. Embassy in Egypt, the indictment says. It notes that such information is considered highly sensitive and could pose significant security concerns if disclosed.
Without telling his staff or the State Department, Bob Menendez texted the information to Nadine Menendez, who forwarded the message to Hana. He then sent it to an Egyptian government official, the indictment says.
At a dinner about the same time, Bob Menendez disclosed to Hana other nonpublic information about the United States’ military aid to Egypt, the indictment says. Shortly after the dinner, Hana texted another Egyptian official: “The ban on small arms and ammunition to Egypt has been lifted. That means sales can begin. That will include sniper rifles among other articles.”
The indictment also shows the cozy relationship Nadine Menendez and Hana fostered between her husband and Egyptian officials. Once, the indictment says, Bob Menendez met in his Senate office with Nadine Menendez, Hana and an Egyptian intelligence official to discuss a human rights matter that had been affecting aid to the country.
Later that evening, the group headed to a steakhouse in Washington for dinner.
Hana started operating his company, IS EG Halal, in 2019, and within a year, the Egyptian government had made it the sole entity authorized to certify that halal meat imported to Egypt from anywhere in the world had been prepared according to Islamic law. Before that, at least four companies in the United States were authorized to make that certification.
The indictment says the company was used to advance the corrupt scheme by “providing a revenue stream” from which Hana “could make good on the bribe payments he had promised” the senator through Nadine Menendez.
The indictment says Hana at times also received assistance from Daibes and Uribe, the other businessmen charged in the case, in providing payments to Nadine Menendez.
At one point in 2019, she complained to her husband that she had not received a check she was owed.
“I am soooooo upset,” she texted the senator, adding that Hana had not left her an envelope. She asked whether she should text Daibes, but the senator responded, “No, you should not text or email.”
Shortly thereafter, she called Daibes, and Hana’s company issued a $10,000 check to a consulting firm run by her.
During a search of the couple’s home in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, and a safe deposit box in Nadine Menendez’s name, investigators found $550,000 in cash, much of it hidden in clothing, closets and a safe. Some of the cash was stuffed in envelopes that contained the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes or his driver, who was not named.
Investigators also found more than $100,000 worth of gold bars, some of which were featured in photographs in the indictment.
Hana’s spokesperson said that based on an initial review of the charges, “they have absolutely no merit.”
Representatives for Daibes and Uribe could not immediately be reached for comment on the charges.
The indictment will quickly resound in Washington and in New Jersey.
Bob Menendez is already facing at least one Democratic challenger in his planned run for reelection to a fourth Senate term, and the Republican mayor of Mendham Borough, New Jersey, has also announced that she will compete for the seat.
If Menendez were to step down before the end of his term, as Murphy has suggested, the governor would be responsible for appointing a successor.
“These are serious charges that implicate national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system,” Murphy said in a statement.
“The alleged facts are so serious,” he added, “that they compromise the ability of Senator Menendez to effectively represent the people of our state.”
The Menendezes and their three co-defendants are expected to appear in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the Southern District.
The charges are not the senator’s first encounter with the law. In 2015, Menendez was indicted in New Jersey on bribery charges in what federal prosecutors called a scheme between the senator and a wealthy eye doctor to trade political favors for gifts worth close to $1 million, including luxury vacations in the Caribbean and campaign contributions. Menendez’s corruption trial ended in a mistrial in November 2017, after the jury said it was unable to reach a verdict.
The judge later acquitted Menendez of several charges and the Justice Department dismissed the others.

A Team Effort to Reduce Waste: [Climate]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Leagues, teams and stadiums are working to embrace sustainable practices, fight the effects of climate change and inspire fans to do the same.
This article is part of our special section on the Climate Forward event that will include policy and climate leaders from around the world.
The Resource Recovery Room beneath Mercedes-Benz Stadium was humming with activity one afternoon last month. Workers fed food into a compactor for compostable material, aluminum cans into another compactor and tossed other items into a variety of recycling bins.
It was messy work but a critical part of the stadium's ambitious effort to steer more than 90 percent of its waste away from landfills. Critical because recycling and composting help reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and ambitious because the two-million-square-foot stadium each year welcomes an average of three million visitors and produces more than four million pounds of waste.
"We're making sure that we're not only diverting at the highest level possible," said Andrew Bohenko, who oversees the sustainable initiatives at the stadium, which hosts the N.F.L.'s Atlanta Falcons, M.L.S.'s Atlanta United and hundreds of events, but also insuring "that we're getting multiple reuses out of the materials that we have in the stadium."
Diverting tons of waste from landfills is next-level stuff for one of the country's greenest stadiums. The $ 1.6 billion building was an environmental trendsetter when it opened in 2017 as the first stadium in the United States to win Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum certification from the United States Green Building Council, which grades sustainable design and energy efficiency.
To win that designation, the stadium was located near ample public transportation, was built with locally sourced and recycled materials and included a 20-foot-high cistern that holds up to 680,000 gallons of rainwater that is used to irrigate the vegetation around the building and reduce flooding nearby.
But Arthur Blank, a co-founder of Home Depot, whose company owns the teams and operates the stadium, wanted the building to run as sustainably as possible, too, which meant reducing as much waste as possible. The 6,000-square-foot Resource Recovery Room was created so dozens of workers could sort compost and recyclables like cardboard and metals into compactors and balers.
Mr. Bohenko and his team partnered with recyclers, garbage haulers and environmental groups, which remove 14 types of recyclable and compostable waste. They pushed vendors to eliminate nonrecyclable material in their packaging and placed clearly marked bins -- one for compost, another for recyclables -- throughout the building.
In January, the 75,000-seat stadium was deemed a zero waste facility by Green Business Certification Inc., a first for a venue of its size. This year, the stadium expects to spend a net $ 400,000, or about 13 cents per visitor, to compost and recycle 2,000 tons of waste. But as the staff (and fans) become more efficient at collecting, sorting and recycling, the price should fall.
Waste and emissions at sports venues is a fraction of those produced by the mining, transportation or construction industries, to name a few. But teams and stadiums are the country's social commons where people of all ages and backgrounds meet. That gives venue operators a platform to push their priorities, including the need for sustainable practices.
"We bring people together and give them a good time, and then talk about topics in a nonpolitical way," said Dietmar Exler, the stadium's chief operating officer. "We have a tremendous opportunity, much bigger than we think."
To their surprise, Mr. Exler and Mr. Bohenko found that their message has easily dovetailed with the priorities of fans and customers who visit Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Suite holders have been asking for green amenities like compost bins. Young fans are educating their elders on how to separate their waste and taking tours of the stadium that highlight the venue's sustainability practices.
"Sports organizations are attentive to their social licenses to operate and that includes climate action," said Allen Hershkowitz, a founding director of Sport and Sustainability International, which advises leagues, teams and venue operators throughout the world. "Fans expect their teams to be environmentally responsible."
More than 200 teams, leagues and organizations globally have signed on to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action framework, which includes commitments to halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Reducing emissions is one of the topics that will be discussed by leaders in business, science, and public policy at The New York Times Climate Forward event on Thursday.
Meeting these goals is complex because of the difficulty of finding clean sources of energy, adequate recyclers and eco-friendly suppliers. For Hattie Park, the sustainability manager at the All England Club, which hosts Wimbledon, reducing the amount of plastics is a big challenge.
Single-use plastic bottles have been largely scrapped and more than 100 water- refilling stations were added for fans who brought their own bottles. Players at Centre Court must use refillable bottles, too.
Drinks are served in reusable cups, which can withstand at least a dozen or more washings, eliminating 500,000 disposable cups and lids each tournament. Customers pay a 1 pound ( $ 1.25) deposit for a cup, and if they return it, they can get the money back or donate the funds to the Wimbledon charitable foundation, which has received more than £130,000 so far.
The racket strings discarded by the players are recycled and made into countertops for tables used at the tournament.
"Doing the small things, it all adds up," Ms. Park said. "It's about finding a use for all these complicated waste streams."
Older building like those at Wimbledon present unique challenges. In Seattle, Climate Pledge Arena, which opened in 2021 after an extensive renovation, is constrained by its modest footprint. The arena's name comes from the commitment created by Amazon and Global Optimism for companies to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.
The arena diverts more than 90 percent of its waste from landfills in part by eliminating single-use plastics and buying compostable trays and other items. During events staff separate recyclables and compost in a small sorting room, and when events end items are separated by staff during cleanup before they reach the room.
"It's procurement on the front end and process on the back end," said Rob Johnson, the head of sustainability for the N.H.L.'s Seattle Kraken, the building's main tenant, along with the W.N.B.A.'s Seattle Storm. "Once you set a course and vision, you have to get a little creative."
Venue operators are now sharing best practices to reduce energy use and waste. Jason McLennan, who helped Climate Pledge Arena reach LEED status, helped set up Green Operations & Advanced Leadership, or GOAL, so arena and stadiums can share data and learn to reduce their energy and water bills.
The team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium created its own zero waste playbook, as well, to provide a road map for diverting waste from landfills by increasing composting and recycling.
"We want to show that we can operate this and make a business case for anybody," Mr. Bohenko said. "It's all attainable wherever you are. You just have to take what you have at your disposal and use that."
The United States Tennis Association, which runs the U.S. Open, followed that approach when a company in Delaware that accepted compostable forks, knives and other utensils used at the tournament closed. The materials, which are separated from other compostables like food scraps, are now sent to a waste-to-energy facility in Westbury, N.Y.
Since 2008, nearly 900 tons of food waste has been sent to compost farms and another 215 tons of unspoiled food has been donated to local communities.
Sponsors at the Open have also gotten involved. Wilson, which provides tennis balls, now ships them in cans with four balls instead of three, with no label and a special cap to reduce the amount of plastic.
"Partners and sponsors care what they are investing in," said Lauren Tracy, the senior director for strategic and business operations at the U.S.T.A. "It needs to be a priority for everyone on this round earth, whether you play tennis or not."

Ford Averts Strike in Canada As Talks in U.S. Inch Along: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Auto Workers union is threatening to expand strikes on Friday if it does not make significant progress in talks with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.
Negotiations between each of the three large U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union remain far from being resolved, but one of the companies -- Ford Motor -- has averted a second strike in Canada.
Late on Tuesday, the company reached a tentative labor agreement with Unifor, Canada's main auto union. The deal was announced minutes before an 11:59 p.m. deadline set by the union for a strike by its 5,600 members at Ford.
Neither side disclosed the terms of the agreement, but Unifor said the company had made a "substantive offer."
"We believe that this agreement will solidify the foundations on which we will continue to bargain gains for generations of autoworkers in Canada," Unifor's national president, Lana Payne, said in a statement.
Unifor's talks with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, started on Aug. 10 but have been overshadowed by the U.A.W. contract talks in the United States.
Ford has an assembly plant and two engine plants in Canada. Unifor selected Ford as the "target" of its talks, meaning it focused on securing the best deal it could from the company before turning to the other two automakers. Now, it will seek to strike similar agreements with G.M. and Stellantis.
Ford's deal in Canada appears to have little bearing on the U.A.W. strikes in the United States.
Last Thursday, the U.A.W. told nearly 13,000 workers to leave their jobs at three U.S. plants: a G.M. pickup truck factory in Wentzville, Mo.; a Ford truck and sport utility vehicle plant in Wayne, Mich.; and a Stellantis S.U.V. plant in Toledo, Ohio.
The talks appear to have progressed only a little since the strikes began on Friday. On Wednesday, the U.A.W. said it was reviewing a new offer from Stellantis but declined to provide details.
The union is seeking a 40 percent increase in wages over four years, saying the pay of the automakers' chief executives rose by roughly that much over the previous four years. The companies have offered raises of just over 20 percent.
The U.S. union also wants more workers to qualify for pension plans, company-paid health care for retirees, shorter working hours and other improvements. And the U.A.W. is seeking an end to a practice under which new hires are paid about $ 17 an hour -- a bit more than half the top union wage of $ 32 an hour.
At $ 32 an hour, a U.A.W. member working 40 hours a week is paid about $ 67,000 a year. In recent years, the companies have paid workers profit-sharing bonuses of $ 9,000 to $ 15,000.
Outside Stellantis's North American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., on Wednesday, workers who are not on strike picketed in support of the work stoppage, chanting, "No justice, no Jeeps."
Josh Boyd, 36, an auto mechanic who works at the headquarters' technical center, said he was ready to walk out if asked by the union. "There's always uncertainty, but there's also excitement," he said. "I think we're going to get a good contract."
Mr. Boyd, who carried his young daughter on his shoulder, said that he earned $ 32 an hour, but that his family of three was stretched. "Day care is $ 250 a week," he said. "I've got a mortgage. My wife is in school, so we are on one income."
LaShawn English, who was elected this year as the director of the U.A.W.'s Region 1, which includes parts of Michigan and Canada, said the wage increases offered by the automakers would apply to most but not all workers. Among those who would not get the same raises are temporary workers who make up about 12 percent of Stellantis's unionized work force of 43,000.
"It's not just about the higher-wage workers," she said. "We have to move everybody forward. We can't leave people behind."
Earlier on Wednesday, Stellantis presented a new offer to the union but did not disclose details other than to say it primarily addressed issues other than wages. The company also said it had to lay off 68 workers at a machining plant in Ohio, and might have to lay off 300 more in Indiana because of the U.A.W.'s strike at its Toledo plant, which makes Jeeps.
On Tuesday, the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said the union might expand the strike to additional plants this week if it did not make significant progress toward an agreement. Mr. Fain is expected to announce additional strike locations Friday morning with workers leaving their jobs at noon.
In the past, the U.A.W. typically struck at all locations of one automaker at a time. Mr. Fain was elected president of the union this year on promises to take a more combative approach. His unusual strike strategy, frequent media appearances and strident criticisms of management appear to have caught the automakers off guard.
On Friday, Mr. Fain appeared at a rally of several hundred workers in Detroit along with Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent.
On Wednesday, G.M.'s second-highest-ranking executive, its president, Mark Reuss, sought to rebut Mr. Fain's criticisms in an opinion essay in The Detroit Free Press.
He said G.M. had offered to increase wages 20 percent over the next four years, which would lift the top wage to more than $ 39 an hour, or about $ 82,000 a year, based on a 40-hour workweek. Entry-level workers now earning $ 17 an hour would reach $ 39 an hour after four years.
"U.A.W. leadership claims G.M. pays its team members 'poverty' wages,"' Mr. Reuss wrote. "This is simply not true."
While G.M. is making near-record profits -- it made almost $ 10 billion in 2022 -- Mr. Reuss said the company was investing heavily to make the transition to electric vehicles, including $ 11 billion this year. He added that the company could not afford to pay what the U.A.W. was seeking if it wanted to remain competitive and healthy.
"The fundamental reality is that the U.A.W.'s demands can be described in one word -- untenable," he wrote, adding, "As the past has clearly shown, nobody wins in a strike."
Separately, the U.A.W. said on Wednesday that 190 union members went on strike at a Tuscaloosa, Ala., plant owned by ZF, a company that supplies axles to Mercedes-Benz.

Key to Walkout: Industry's Shift To Electric Cars: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Carmakers are anxious to keep costs down as they ramp up electric vehicle manufacturing, while striking workers want to preserve jobs as the industry shifts to batteries.
A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated on Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry's future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford's moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 U.A.W. workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40 percent pay increase over four years but the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the U.A.W. would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
"The transition to E.V.s is dominating every bit of this discussion," said John Casesa, senior managing director at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
"It's unspoken," Mr. Casesa added. "But really, it's all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry."
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $ 4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers' total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla's employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, said in an interview on Friday. "We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future," he said, "not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers."
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don't need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the U.A.W. has more clout. One of the union's demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers' national labor contracts -- a demand that the automakers have said they can't meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
"We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution and the way we're going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution -- a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the U.A.W. and other unions.
"The U.A.W. is really taking a stand for communities across the country to make sure this transition benefits everybody," Ms. Janis added.
Automakers have been racking up record profits during the last decade, but they cannot afford to lose time from work stoppages in their race to compete with Tesla and foreign automakers.
The three companies are already struggling to get their electric vehicle business going. A new G.M. battery factory in Ohio has been slow to produce batteries, delaying electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and other vehicles. Ford this year had to suspend production of its electric F-150 Lightning in February after a battery caught fire in one of the pickups that was parked near the factory for a quality check. And Stellantis won't even begin selling any fully electric vehicles in the United States until next year.
Those problems and Tesla's growing sales could put the union in a strong position to extract a good deal.
On Thursday, in a sign that automakers are willing to go much further than they had previously, G.M. offered a 20 percent pay raise over four years. That is half of what the union is seeking but far more than workers received in recent contracts. President Biden on Friday strongly supported the union in remarks at the White House. The administration has been pouring billions into programs to promote electric vehicles and does not want a strike to delay a centerpiece of its climate policy.
Despite all the money that automakers have made in recent years, their executives express a profound unease about the growth of electric vehicles, which account for 7 percent of the U.S. new car market so far this year and are on track to surpass sales of one million this year. Managers are acutely aware that traditional companies like theirs have a poor track record of retaining dominance after a big change in technology. Witness the way that Apple sidelined Nokia and Motorola as cellphones became smartphones.
Auto company executives and most industry analysts underestimated how quickly electric vehicles would catch on and cannot confidently forecast how sales, which have been bumpy lately, will grow in the future. "I don't think anyone can perfectly predict what the adoption will be," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Speaking to "CBS Mornings" on Friday, Ms. Barra said an excessive pay raise would undermine G.M.'s ability to continue producing vehicles with internal combustion engines while also developing electric vehicles. "This is a critical juncture where investing is very important," she said.
Still, unions and their supporters are unlikely to express much sympathy for auto executives. Ms. Barra, Mr. Farley of Ford and the chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, have gotten tens of millions of dollars in compensation packages in recent years. The companies' shareholders have been rewarded with dividends and share buybacks.
Unions "are not going to have a lot of patience for sob stories," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online marketplace.
Adjusted for inflation, wages for autoworkers in the United States have fallen 19 percent since 2008, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
At the same time, union officials are aware of the changes in the industry and have said they do not want to handicap G.M., Ford and Stellantis as the companies try to recover ground they have lost to Tesla, which has aggressively resisted attempts to unionize its factories. The Detroit carmakers also face challengers like Rivian, a start-up that makes electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Illinois, as well as foreign-owned rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, whose U.S. factories, mostly in the South, are not unionized.
"That's the biggest challenge here," Mr. Brauer added, "trying to commit to a long-term contract in an industry that is very uncertain and unpredictable over the next five years."
Union supporters say it would be wrong to blame workers if the traditional carmakers cannot compete with Tesla and other rivals.
"If you look at the breakdown at what it costs to build an E.V., labor is a very small part of the equation. Batteries are the most," Ms. Janis of Jobs to Move America said. "This idea that the U.A.W. is going to price Ford, G.M. and Stellantis out of the market is not true."
But other analysts said that a long work stoppage could help Tesla and foreign automakers gain ground on G.M., Ford and Stellantis.
"If something happens to disrupt their business, does that give a leg up to the emerging electric vehicle makers?" said Steve Patton, who overseas the consulting firm EY's work with auto companies. "Who stands to benefit if there is a protracted strike?"

A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry’s future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford’s moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40% pay increase over four years; the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the UAW would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
“The transition to EVs is dominating every bit of this discussion,” said John Casesa, senior managing director at investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
“It's unspoken,” Casesa added. “But really, it’s all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry.”
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, GM and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers’ total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla’s employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company’s CEO, said in an interview Friday. “We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future,” he said, “not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers.”
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don’t need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South, where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the UAW has more clout. One of the union’s demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers’ national labor contracts — a demand that the automakers have said they can’t meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
“We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution, and the way we’re going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution — a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many,” said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the UAW and other unions.
“The UAW is really taking a stand for communities across the country to make sure this transition benefits everybody,” Janis added.
Automakers have been racking up record profits during the last decade, but they cannot afford to lose time from work stoppages in their race to compete with Tesla and foreign automakers.
The three companies are already struggling to get their electric vehicle business going. A new GM battery factory in Ohio has been slow to produce batteries, delaying electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and other vehicles. Ford had to suspend production of its electric F-150 Lightning in February after a battery caught fire in one of the pickups that was parked near the factory for a quality check. And Stellantis won’t even begin selling fully electric vehicles in the United States until next year.
Those problems and Tesla’s growing sales could put the union in a strong position to extract a good deal.
On Thursday, in a sign that automakers are willing to go much further than they had previously, GM offered a 20% pay raise over four years. That is half of what the union is seeking but far more than workers received in recent contracts. President Joe Biden on Friday strongly supported the union in remarks at the White House. The administration has been pouring billions into programs to promote electric vehicles and does not want a strike to delay a centerpiece of its climate policy.
Despite all the money that automakers have made in recent years, their executives express a profound unease about the growth of electric vehicles, which account for 7% of the U.S. new car market so far this year and are on track to surpass sales of 1 million this year. Managers are acutely aware that traditional companies like theirs have a poor track record of retaining dominance after a big change in technology. Witness the way that Apple sidelined Nokia and Motorola as cellphones became smartphones.

UAW Strike Looms Over Detroit Auto Show

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to find their way to showrooms. Despite those efforts, the union called a strike at three factories starting Friday.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike would almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer.

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to make their way to showrooms.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
“We’re seeing movement from the companies, but they’re still not willing to agree to the kinds of raises that will make up for inflation on top of decades of falling wages,” Fain said Wednesday evening in a video on Facebook.
He added that workers at all three companies were prepared to strike and stay away from their factory stations as long as it took to win big gains. The UAW has never struck the three companies simultaneously before.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike will almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer, and hoped to have a deal that would avert a strike.

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

Mohamed al-Fayed, 94, Tycoon Whose Son Died With Diana, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An Egyptian businessman, he built an empire of trophy properties in London, Paris and elsewhere, but it was all overshadowed by a fatal car crash that stunned the world.
Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian business tycoon whose empire of trophy properties and influence in Europe and the Middle East was overshadowed by the 1997 Paris car crash that killed his eldest son, Dodi, and Diana, the Princess of Wales, died on Wednesday. He was 94.
His death was confirmed on Friday in a statement by the Fulham Football Club in Britain, of which Mr. Fayed was a former owner. It did not say where he died.
The patriarch of a family that rose from humble origins to fabled riches, Mr. Fayed controlled far-flung enterprises in oil, shipping, banking and real estate, including the palatial Ritz Hotel in Paris and, for 25 years, the storied London retail emporium Harrods. Forbes estimated his net worth at $ 2 billion this year, ranking his wealth as 1,516th in the world.
In a sense, Mr. Fayed was a citizen of the world. He had homes in London, Paris, New York, Geneva, St. Tropez and other locales; a fleet of 40 ships based in Genoa, Italy, and in Cairo; and businesses that reached from the Persian Gulf to North Africa, Europe and the Americas. He held Egyptian citizenship but rarely if ever returned to his native land.
Mr. Fayed lived and worked mostly in Britain, where for a half-century he was a quintessential outsider, scorned by the establishment in a society still embedded with old-boy networks. He clashed repeatedly with the government and business rivals over his property acquisitions and attempts to influence members of Parliament. He campaigned noisily for British citizenship, but his applications were repeatedly denied.
"It's the colonial, imperial fantasy," Mr. Fayed told The New York Times in 1995. "Anyone who comes from a colony, as Egypt was before, they think he's nothing. So you prove you're better than they are. You do things that are the talk of the town. And they think, 'How can he? He's only an Egyptian."'
He reveled in the trappings of a British aristocrat. He bought a castle in Scotland and sometimes wore a kilt; snapped up a popular British football club; cultivated Conservative prime ministers and members of Parliament; sponsored the Royal Horse Show at Windsor; and tried unsuccessfully to salvage Punch, the moribund satirical magazine that had lampooned the British establishment for 150 years.
His takeover of the venerable Harrods in 1985 struck many Britons as shameless brass, something akin to buying Big Ben. A year later, as if securing a jewel in the crown of British heritage, Mr. Fayed signed a 50-year lease on the 19th-century villa in Paris that had been the home of the former King Edward VIII of Britain and Wallis Warfield Simpson, the divorced American woman for whom he abdicated his throne in 1936.
But Mr. Fayed's triumph as an Anglophile was the made-for-tabloids romance between his eldest son, Emad, known as Dodi, and the Princess of Wales, who had recently been divorced from Prince Charles (now King Charles III) and alienated from the royal family. It began in the summer of 1997, when Mr. Fayed invited Diana and her sons to spend some time at his home on the French Riviera and on one of his yachts. Dodi was there too.
The Egyptian-born nephew of the Saudi billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, Dodi was a notorious playboy who gave lavish parties, financed films, dated beautiful women and was once briefly married. He and Diana had been acquainted, but by many accounts they fell in love on the Mediterranean sojourn. As their romance bloomed, the British press pounced. Paparazzi hounded the couple everywhere they went.
In the early hours of Aug. 31, 1997, a Mercedes-Benz carrying Diana and Dodi and driven by Henri Paul, a Fayed security agent who was drunk and traveling at a high speed trying to elude carloads of pursuing paparazzi, slammed head-on into a concrete pillar in a tunnel in Paris. All three were killed.
Controversy exploded over the cause of the crash and the implications of the affair. Some tabloids suggested that an immigrant had been an unfit suitor for a princess. But friends said that the couple had planned to marry, and that the Fayed family had offered Diana and her sons a warmth that contrasted with the way Britain's royal family had shunned her after the divorce.
As rumors and conspiracy theories swirled, Mr. Fayed declared that the two had been murdered by "people who did not want Diana and Dodi to be together." He said they had been engaged to marry and maintained that they had called him an hour before the crash to tell him that she was pregnant. Buckingham Palace and the princess's family denounced his remarks as malicious fantasy.
The deaths inspired waves of books, articles and investigations of conspiracy theories, as well as a period of soul-searching among Britons, who resented the royal family's standoffish behavior and were caught up in displays of mass grief. In 2006, the British police ruled the crash an accident.
And in 2008, a British coroner's jury rejected all conspiracy theories involving the royal family, British intelligence services and others. It attributed the deaths to "gross negligence" by the driver and the pursuing paparazzi. It also said a French pathologist had found that Diana was not pregnant.
Mr. Fayed called the verdict biased, but he and his lawyers did not pursue the matter further. "I've had enough," he told Britain's ITV News. "I'm leaving this to God to get my revenge."
Mohamed al-Fayed was born Mohamed Abdel Moneim Fayed in Alexandria, Egypt, on Jan. 27, 1929, one of five children of a primary-school teacher, Aly Aly Fayed. Details about his early life are murky.
His accounts of growing up in a prosperous merchant family were discounted by British investigators. He sold sewing machines and joined his two younger brothers, Ali and Salah, in a shipping business. In the early 1950s, Adnan Khashoggi set the brothers up in a venture that exported Egyptian furniture to Saudi Arabia. It flourished.
In 1954, Mr. Fayed married Mr. Khashoggi's sister, Samira. Dodi was their only child. They were divorced in 1956. In 1985, he married Heini Wathén, a Finn. They had four children, all born in Britain: Jasmine, Karim, Camilla and Omar.
Information on survivors was not immediately available.
The Fayed shipping interests profited handsomely from an oil boom in the Persian Gulf in the 1960s. Acting as middlemen for British construction companies and gulf rulers, they helped develop the port of Dubai, the Dubai Trade Center and other properties in what is now the United Arab Emirates.
Mr. Fayed, who made all his family's major investment and financial decisions, moved to London in the mid-1960s. He added "al-" to his surname, implying aristocratic origins. After buying the Scottish castle, he expanded its estate to 65,000 acres; after acquiring the Fulham Football Club, he built it into a top team in a nation infatuated with the sport. (He sold the team in 2013 to a Pakistani American businessman.) A heavy contributor to the Conservative Party, he nurtured relationships with members of Parliament and Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major.
In 1979, the Fayed brothers bought the fading Ritz Hotel in Paris for under $ 30 million and, with a 10-year, $ 250 million renovation, turned it into one of the world's most luxurious hotels. Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed dined in the Imperial Suite before their fatal crash.
In 1984-85, in their greatest commercial coup in Britain, the Fayeds paid $ 840 million for the House of Fraser, the parent company of Harrods and scores of other stores, and invested $ 300 million more to refurbish the chain's flagship, in London's exclusive Knightsbridge section.
Prodded by a business rival, the government investigated the Harrods deal and in 1990 concluded that the Fayed brothers had "dishonestly misrepresented" themselves as descendants of an old landowning and shipbuilding family. The government report said the money for Harrods had probably come from the Sultan of Brunei. The sultan denied it, and Mr. Fayed, who was not accused of wrongdoing, called the report a smear.
In investigative reports by the press and the police, Mr. Fayed was accused by many women of unwanted sexual advances, job-related sexual harassment of female employees at Harrods, and even sexual assault involving teenage girls. He denied the allegations and, although he was questioned by the authorities in Britain, he was never prosecuted on such charges.
Mr. Fayed was bitter about being stymied in his quest for British citizenship, although all his children by his second wife held that status. As he noted, he had lived in Britain for decades, paid millions in taxes, employed thousands of people and, through his enterprises, contributed mightily to the economy.
"They could not accept that an Egyptian could own Harrods, so they threw mud at me," he told reporters. He sold Harrods in 2010 to Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund of the Emirate of Qatar, for more than $ 2 billion, and announced his retirement.

Why Plugging In Your E.V. May Soon Generate Confusion: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many carmakers and charging companies are switching to the Tesla plug for electric vehicles. Why are they doing that, and what will it mean?
With a push from Congress, automakers and charging companies are planning to install tens of thousands of fast chargers on American highways capable of refueling electric cars in half an hour or less.
That's good news for anyone who owns an electric car or is thinking about buying one. But it's also confusing because of a debate about what kind of plugs those new chargers and cars will use now and in the future.
Ford Motor, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and other automakers plan to abandon the plugs their electric cars use today for those designed by Tesla. But they won't begin selling cars with the Tesla plugs until 2025.
Until then, cars like the Ford Mustang Mach-E or Chevrolet Bolt will come with technology that may eventually become obsolete, the equivalent of Betamax videocassette recorders.
What plugs do electric cars use today?
There are two main kinds of plugs. The most widely used was developed by Tesla, which dominates the electric car business, and, so far, works only with the company's cars. It's known as the North American Charging Standard.
Cars made by most other manufacturers use a plug known as the Combined Charging System. Any electric car charger that is funded in part by the federal government under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has to be able to charge cars that use the CCS plug.
Many established automakers are switching from CCS to the North American plug, which will allow their owners to use a portion of Tesla's network of fast chargers -- 12,000 -- and feel more confident about finding a place to refuel. Tesla has roughly 20,000 fast chargers in the United States, or about two-thirds of such chargers.
The established manufacturers will offer adapters that allow Tesla chargers to deliver power to cars with CCS receptacles in early 2024. Then, in 2025, new cars sold by the automakers will use Tesla plugs without adapters.
With so many big automakers switching to the Tesla standard, CCS's days might be numbered in the United States. Of course, cars built for CCS plugs will stay on the road for years, which means that charging stations will need adapters or offer both kinds of plugs for the foreseeable future.
Why are automakers switching to the Tesla plug?
Established carmakers are switching to Tesla's system mainly because it is more widespread than what they are using today and appears to work better.
Tesla's charging network is often found in locations that don't have CCS chargers. Many auto experts and drivers also say Tesla chargers are more reliable, and the company's plug is smaller, lighter and easier to handle than the CCS plug.
In addition, Tesla has designed its system so that drivers can plug into one of its chargers and walk away. The chargers recognize each Tesla car and bill its owner's credit card automatically.
The performance of the charging networks operated by other companies is notoriously uneven. Charging procedures vary. Some chargers require drivers to plug in and then open an app on their phones. Others want customers to open an app first. Some chargers accept credit cards, but others don't.
Drivers of electric cars that are not Teslas often complain about broken or finnicky chargers -- complaints validated by independent studies.
How much does charger location matter?
It matters a lot.
Perhaps Tesla's biggest advantage is that it has been at this for a long time. It has secured choice locations at popular shopping centers and along busy highways.
As a result, newer charging companies are often at a disadvantage. Many of them have had to place some chargers in areas that lack restrooms or restaurants. Stopping at some chargers, in empty parking lots, can feel unsafe.
In July, BMW, G.M., Honda and four other automakers announced that they would jointly install 30,000 chargers in the United States and Canada. These chargers will have both plugs.
Does the CCS plug have any advantages?
Yes, these plugs can charge any electric car, including Teslas if drivers are carrying adapters, which often come with their cars.
But the reverse is not true -- the vast majority of Tesla chargers can charge only Teslas. Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, said in February that he intended to open his company's charging network to cars made by other automakers. As of late August, only about a dozen of the company's U.S. charging stations, all in California, New York or Texas, were available to other cars.
CCS technology is not dominated by one company. While Tesla has promised to hand oversight of its plug to an independent body, the company and Mr. Musk have often been confrontational when dealing with other businesses and government agencies. That's why some auto experts believe that established automakers could regret relying on Tesla.
While charging companies that offer CCS plugs have struggled to offer reliable and easy-to-use services, there are many of them. Several, including EVgo and Electrify America, operate nationwide and compete with one another on price and service. Tesla is more insulated from competition, though that will change as more companies offer chargers with the plugs its cars use.

With a push from Congress, automakers and charging companies are planning to install tens of thousands of fast chargers on American highways capable of refueling electric cars in a half-hour or less.
That’s good news for anyone who owns an electric car or is thinking about buying one. But it’s also confusing because of a debate about what kind of plugs those new chargers and cars will use now and in the future.
Ford Motor, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and other automakers plan to abandon the plugs their electric cars use today for those designed by Tesla. But they won’t begin selling cars with the Tesla plugs until 2025.
Until then, cars like the Ford Mustang Mach-E or Chevrolet Bolt will come with technology that may eventually become obsolete, the equivalent of Betamax videocassette recorders.
What plugs do electric cars use today?
There are two main kinds of plugs. The most widely used was developed by Tesla, which dominates the electric car business, and, so far, works only with the company’s cars. It’s known as the North American Charging Standard.
Cars made by most other manufacturers use a plug known as the Combined Charging System. Any electric car charger that is funded in part by the federal government under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has to be able to charge cars that use the CCS plug.
Many established automakers are switching from CCS to the North American plug, which will allow their owners to use a portion of Tesla’s network of fast chargers — 12,000 — and feel more confident about finding a place to refuel. Tesla has roughly 20,000 fast chargers in the United States, or about two-thirds of such chargers.
The established manufacturers will offer adapters that allow Tesla chargers to deliver power to cars with CCS receptacles in early 2024. Then, in 2025, new cars sold by the automakers will use Tesla plugs without adapters.
With so many big automakers switching to the Tesla standard, CCS’ days might be numbered in the United States. Of course, cars built for CCS plugs will stay on the road for years, which means that charging stations will need adapters or offer both kinds of plugs for the foreseeable future.
Why are automakers switching to the Tesla plug?
Established carmakers are switching to Tesla’s system mainly because it is more widespread than what they are using today and appears to work better.
Tesla’s charging network is often found in locations that don’t have CCS chargers. Many auto experts and drivers also say that Tesla chargers are more reliable and the company’s plug is smaller, lighter and easier to handle than the CCS plug.
In addition, Tesla has designed its system so that drivers can plug in to one of its chargers and walk away. The chargers recognize each Tesla car and bill its owner’s credit card automatically.
The performance of the charging networks operated by other companies is notoriously uneven. Charging procedures vary. Some chargers require drivers to plug in and then open an app on their phones. Others want customers to open an app first. Some chargers accept credit cards, but others don’t.
Drivers of electric cars that are not Teslas often complain about broken or finnicky chargers — complaints validated by independent studies.
How much does charger location matter?
It matters a lot.
Perhaps Tesla’s biggest advantage is that it has been at this for a long time. It has secured choice locations at popular shopping centers and along busy highways.
As a result, newer charging companies are often at a disadvantage. Many of them have had to place some chargers in areas that lack restrooms or restaurants. Stopping at some chargers, in empty parking lots, can feel unsafe.
In July, BMW, GM, Honda and four other automakers announced they would jointly install 30,000 chargers in the United States and Canada. These chargers will have both plugs.
Does the CCS plug have any advantages?
Yes, these plugs can charge any electric car, including Teslas if drivers are carrying adapters, which often come with their cars.
But the reverse is not true — the vast majority of Tesla chargers can charge only Teslas. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, said in February that he intended to open his company’s charging network to cars made by other automakers. As of late August, only about a dozen of the company’s U.S. charging stations, all in California, New York or Texas, were available to other cars.

How Do We Manage China's Decline?: [Op-Ed]

Author: Stephens, Bret

Publication info: Stephens, Bret.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Several years ago, the Harvard political scientist Graham Allison coined the term "Thucydides' trap." It was based on the ancient historian's observation that the real cause of the Peloponnesian War "was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta." Allison saw the pattern of tensions -- and frequent wars -- between rising and ruling powers repeating itself throughout history, most recently, he believes, with the challenge that a rising China poses to American hegemony.
It's an intriguing thesis, but in China's case it has a glaring flaw: The main challenge we will face from the People's Republic in the coming decade stems not from its rise but from its decline -- something that has been obvious for years and has become undeniable in the past year with the country's real estate market crash.
Western policymakers need to reorient their thinking around this fact. How? With five don'ts and two dos.
First, don't think of China's misfortunes as our good fortune.
A China that can buy less from the world -- whether in the form of handbags from Italy, copper from Zambia or grain from the United States -- will inevitably constrain global growth. For the U.S. chip maker Qualcomm, 64 percent of its sales last year came from China; for the German automaker Mercedes-Benz, 37 percent of its retail car sales were made there. In 2021, Boeing forecast that China will account for about one in five of its wide-body plane deliveries over the next two decades. A truism that bears repeating is that there is only one economy: the global economy.
Second, don't assume the crisis will be short-lived.
Optimists think the crisis won't affect Western countries too badly because their exports to China account for a small share of their output. But the potential scale of the crisis is staggering. Real estate and its related sectors account for nearly 30 percent of China's gross domestic product, according to a 2020 paper by the economists Ken Rogoff and Yuanchen Yang. It is heavily financed by the country's notoriously opaque $ 2.9 trillion trust industry, which also appears to be tottering. And even if China averts a full-scale crisis, long-term growth will be sharply constrained by a working-age population that will fall by nearly a quarter by 2050.
Third, don't assume competent economic management.
Last month Donald Trump described the rule of China's president, Xi Jinping, as "smart, brilliant, everything perfect." The truth is closer to the opposite. As a young man, according to a peer from his youth, Xi was "considered of only average intelligence," earned a three-year degree in "applied Marxism" and rode out the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath by becoming "redder than red." His tenure as supreme leader has been marked by a shift to greater state control of the economy, the intensified harassment of foreign businesses and a campaign of terror against independent-minded business leaders. One result has been ever-increasing capital flight, despite heavy-handed capital controls. China's richest people have also left the country in increasing numbers during Xi's tenure -- a good indication of where they think their opportunities do and do not lie.
Fourth, don't take domestic tranquillity as a given.
Xi's government's recent decision to suppress data on youth unemployment -- just north of 21 percent in June, double what it was four years ago -- is part of a pattern of crude obfuscation that mainly diminishes investor confidence. But the struggles of the young are almost always a potent source of upheaval, as they were in 1989 on the eve of the Tiananmen Square protests. Never mind Thucydides' trap; the real China story may lie in a version of what's sometimes called Tocqueville's paradox: the idea that revolutions happen when rising expectations are frustrated by abruptly worsening social and economic conditions.
Fifth, don't suppose that a declining power is a less dangerous one.
In many ways, it's more dangerous. Rising powers can afford to bide their time, but declining ones will be tempted to take their chances. President Biden was off the cuff but on the mark this month when he said of China's leaders that "when bad folks have problems, they do bad things." In other words, as China's economic fortunes sink, the risks to Taiwan grow.
Sixth, do stick to four red lines.
American policymakers need to be unbending and uncowed when it comes to our core interests in our relationship: freedom of navigation, particularly in the South China Sea; the security of Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies; the protection of U.S. intellectual property and national security; and the safety of U.S. citizens (both in China and in the United States) and residents of Chinese ancestry. Helping Ukraine defeat Russia is also a part of an overall China strategy, in that it sends a signal of Western political resolve and military capability that will make Beijing think twice about a military adventure across the Taiwan Strait.
Seventh, do pursue a policy of détente.
We should not seek a new cold war with China. We cannot afford a hot one. The best response to China's economic woes is American economic magnanimity. That could start with the removal of the Trump administration tariffs that have done as much to hurt American companies and consumers as they have the Chinese.
Whether that will change the fundamental pattern of Beijing's bad behavior is far from certain. But as China slides toward crisis, it behooves us to try.

Union's Actions in Georgia Aim to Raise the Heat On Biden and Automakers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A coalition of unions and civic groups is pushing one of the world's largest automakers to protect and train workers in return for federal money under President Biden's signature laws.
A coalition of labor unions and civic groups in Georgia and Alabama will launch a pressure campaign on Monday targeting Hyundai's electric vehicle plants and its clean energy suppliers, an effort that could also push the Biden administration to make good on its oft-repeated pledge to create not just jobs but "good union jobs."
By focusing on the shift to electric vehicles at Hyundai, a nonunion carmaker expected to reap huge benefits from Mr. Biden's prized initiatives, the coalition hopes to make inroads at other automakers, such as B.M.W. in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama, which similarly chose union-hostile territory for their American manufacturing bases.
The campaign could also raise the heat on domestic automakers in the middle of contract negotiations with the newly aggressive United Automobile Workers union, which is focused on raising wages at electric vehicle suppliers like battery makers.
For Mr. Biden, the Hyundai campaign has political ramifications, in setting specific demands on one of the largest automakers in the world in one of the most important swing states in the 2024 presidential election, Georgia.
"The people in the community should be able to come to work in these plants, with a livable wage and good jobs," said Yvonne T. Brooks, president of the Georgia State A.F.L.-C.I.O., adding that "to bring jobs here but not provide a livable wage kind of defeats the purpose."
Mr. Biden has campaigned on the sheer number of jobs created by his three signature laws, a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change. A $ 25 million advertising blitz announced by his campaign last week kicked off with a one-minute spot that proclaims, "Manufacturing jobs are coming home," and "America is leading the world in clean energy."
But despite low unemployment, tempering inflation and steady job creation, Mr. Biden's overall approval ratings have been dragged down by voters' refusal to give him credit for the good economic news. Clifford Young, who oversees U.S. public opinion research at Ipsos, a polling company, said that last year's 8.5 percent inflation and the ensuing interest rate hikes and slower economic growth might have sealed Mr. Biden's fate with the voting public.
"The dirty secret is a bad economy hurts a president more than a good economy helps," he said.
White House officials, who were notified of the Hyundai effort ahead of time, said Thursday that Mr. Biden fully backs the aims of the coalition in Georgia. And labor leaders have generally supported Mr. Biden as the most pro-union president ever.
But in a notable shift, those leaders also say the volume of jobs created on his watch may not be enough to win worker loyalties if those jobs are low-paid, dangerous and insecure. That is especially true if substandard jobs are underwritten by the taxpayer.
"I know the president can't make stipulations that all new jobs have to go to union workers, but there have to be fair labor standards for jobs that are supported by tax dollars," said David Green, the United Automobile Workers' regional director for Ohio and Indiana. "Members are a little frustrated with it. It's our tax dollars, too."
Such concerns have led the U.A.W. to withhold its endorsement of Mr. Biden as the union's new leadership threatens to strike over wages and benefits at electric vehicle suppliers. Mr. Biden has responded with support, tapping a senior adviser and Democratic veteran, Gene B. Sperling, as liaison between the union and the automakers and backing the U.A.W. this month in contract negotiations.
But union leaders are worried about the transition that Mr. Biden has set in motion with his push to address climate change with federal money funding the shift from fossil fuels. They are pressing automakers shifting to electric vehicles to "honor the right to organize," take necessary steps to avoid plant closings, and provide training programs to help workers transition into new jobs at comparable wages.
A letter to the chief executive of Hyundai's American subsidiary, José Muñoz, signed by coalition members including the U.A.W., the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (which is particularly close to Mr. Biden), and religious, community and environmental groups, maps key labor demands.
Such letters, demanding "community benefits agreements" enforced with binding arbitration systems, have been trotted out in the past to little effect. But union leaders said the Hyundai effort is more focused and forward-looking, hinting at the strategy of organizers in the South as unions across the country have become much more aggressive.
The letter pushes for Hyundai and its subsidiaries to hire locally, train workers from the communities around the plants, bolster safety standards, and protect the environment around the plants, which are expected to employ more than 30,000 Georgians and Alabamians. Of those, 12,750 are expected to work at or around Hyundai's new electric vehicle "megasite" in Bryan County near Savannah, the largest economic development project in Georgia's history.
The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45 percent of new hires and 20 percent of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
"These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best," the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make "highroad commitments to workers and their communities."
A spokesman for Hyundai U.S.A., Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company's "top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America's auto industry forward."
Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.
At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Mr. Flippo said, he told them, "Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don't follow up, it shouldn't be up to the union organizers to do it for you."
Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Mr. Biden's three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Ga., plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.
Mr. Flippo credited a rule in the electric school bus grants that said no federal money could be used to oppose union organizing, such as in hiring union-busting law firms during an organizing drive.
"They did use some of those tactics," he said, "but all we had to say was we were going to notify the government and request an audit of where their money was going, and it went away."
The Biden administration has had some successes with clean energy companies, securing commitments by a Danish wind energy giant to use union labor on its offshore wind projects and by a North Dakota metals company to stay neutral in any union drive at its new battery plant.
But union leaders have only so much influence over the rank and file -- and against the pull of Donald J. Trump, who has made working-class appeals central to his political movement. Mr. Green pointed to the former president's promise to revive a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, by enticing an untested start-up to buy the facility. That start-up, Lordstown Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June.
"I will not, could not support any endorsement of Donald Trump," he said. "But we've got a lot of members. Do I think that Trump's rhetoric is contagious among our members? Absolutely."

The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45% of new hires and 20% of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
“These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best,” the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make “highroad commitments to workers and their communities.”
A spokesperson for Hyundai USA, Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company’s “top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America’s auto industry forward.”
Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.
At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Flippo said, he told them, “Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don’t follow up, it shouldn’t be up to the union organizers to do it for you.”
Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Biden’s three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Georgia, plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.
Flippo credited a rule in the electric school bus grants that said no federal money could be used to oppose union organizing, such as in hiring union-busting law firms during an organizing drive.
“They did use some of those tactics,” he said, “but all we had to say was we were going to notify the government and request an audit of where their money was going, and it went away.”
The Biden administration has had some successes with clean energy companies, securing commitments by a Danish wind energy giant to use union labor on its offshore wind projects and by a North Dakota metals company to stay neutral in any union drive at its new battery plant.
But union leaders have only so much influence over the rank and file — and against the pull of Donald Trump, who has made working-class appeals central to his political movement. Green pointed to the former president’s promise to revive a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, by enticing an untested startup to buy the facility. That startup, Lordstown Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June.
“I will not, could not support any endorsement of Donald Trump,” he said. “But we’ve got a lot of members. Do I think that Trump’s rhetoric is contagious among our members? Absolutely.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Online Retailers Are Taking Advantage of a Public Resource: City Streets: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Between 1961, when the social critic Jane Jacobs published "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," and the Covid lockdowns of 2020, it seemed the residential neighborhoods of Washington, like those of certain other, mostly Eastern cities in the United States, had discovered the secret of happiness and safety in the automobile age: narrow streets.
By law, two-way residential streets in Washington are supposed to be 34 feet from curb to curb, but many are a few feet narrower. The average car is about six feet wide, so parked cars on either side constrict a roadway quickly. Once you account for mirrors, swinging doors and the occasional mis-parked minivan or S.U.V., the two lanes of moving traffic might have only 13 or 14 feet of road space to work with. Drivers can move freely but cautiously, braking to pass. For Jacobs and other urban theorists, that's perfect -- these are not neighborhoods that shortcut-seeking motorists consider worthwhile to barrel through, or where playing children need to fear sudden surprises.
This delicate balance of functionality and inconvenience has been upset. In recent years, and especially since the onset of the pandemic, something has changed on city streets -- not the streets themselves but the implicit social agreement that determines how they are used.
The internet is largely to blame. Waze and other navigation apps have channeled impatient motorists into unpromising-looking byways. But even more consequential has been the quantum leap in e-commerce, which has brought hundreds of thousands of vans onto the streets. They're big. FedEx's Freightliner MT45s and Amazon's Ford Transits, Mercedes-Benz Sprinters and Ram ProMasters are all about eight feet wide. Streets that were tight but passable have often wound up blocked off.
This is more than a quality-of-life issue. As with disputes over bicycling rights and privileged parking access for users of certain alternative fuels, it raises a political question about the use of our roadways. We find ourselves in a de facto negotiation over how Amazon and other delivery networks will compensate the country for their partial takeover of the publicly funded road system that makes up a large part of their work space. Concessions can and should be extracted from Amazon. But the public's leverage is weak, the political dynamics are complex and the alternatives are fewer than they used to be.
One can lament the shortsightedness that brought this state of affairs about. The 1992 Supreme Court decision Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, since overturned, absolved companies from collecting sales tax in states where they did not have a physical "nexus." The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998, which blocked new taxes on internet access, also contained language banning "multiple" and "discriminatory" taxes on e-commerce, further tying states' hands. The upshot was an enduring advantage for internet retailers over bricks-and-mortar stores.
That outcome, though deplorable, is not easy to undo. With half a trillion dollars in annual sales and billions in profits most quarters, Amazon is among the largest employers in many states, and the very largest employer in the richest state: New Jersey. Internet commerce has hollowed out the storefronts of old commercial zones and rendered them useless for anything but face-to-face services such as pouring espresso and painting nails. Those bricks-and-mortar businesses that Amazon and others eliminated were not just market competitors at an individual level -- collectively, they provided an alternative retail infrastructure that might have allowed regulators to drive a harder bargain with Amazon.
Adding insult to injury, the big internet retailers have taken great advantage of a communal resource. The real estate that Amazon and other vendors require to make their deliveries is not private but public. We faced a smaller version of this problem with the surge of urban lunch trucks a decade ago. In many cities restaurant owners complained that the trucks were being allowed to undercut them by commandeering public property, while carrying a far lighter burden in rent, regulations and taxes.
The problem with big deliverers is not only larger, it's also more acute, for they can often use public property at a discount. Since the turn of the century, New York City has reportedly given about $ 750 million in parking ticket discounts to UPS, FedEx and other companies that run up huge double-parking bills. Philadelphia has long shown leniency to double parkers, too (although that is reportedly changing).
In theory, the solution to the problem is simple: charge more for double parking and police the abuse more effectively, perhaps with the help of high-tech apps and road sensors that closely track the movement and location of delivery trucks. That is not so different from the way E-ZPass assesses tolls for the use of highways, bridges and tunnels.
However it works, policing e-commerce on the road will require trade-offs. Consider an example from Philadelphia. Many residents have complained about trucks parked along a new waterfront trail in the city as they load in front of a Dave & Buster's. In an interview on the website of the public radio station WHYY, the city's deputy streets department commissioner, Richard Montanez, pleaded for understanding. He noted that the outlet had brought a new purpose to what had been an abandoned warehouse. "Dave & Buster's was there prior to the city building this trail, and now trail users want the Dave & Buster's gone," he told WHYY. "We understand what the community wants, but the community also wants jobs. It's a very delicate balance."
Fair-mindedness in cases like these means paying heed to gentrifying lifestyle nags and speculative developers -- but without reflexively favoring them over established residents and entrenched interests. The politics of repurposing roads looks like the politics of anything else over the last decade or so: a tense battle between a bunch of elite planners doubting the public's wisdom and a seething public doubting the elite's legitimacy.
Bikes are another example. Based on fleeting declines in car traffic during the Covid lockdowns, many zealous city councils made a big bet on bike lanes. To put it less delicately, they cynically transferred the benefit of lots of public property from car commuters and small retail businesses to bike-riding elites and corporate e-businesses. American drivers are bound to take any new road regime poorly. If recent history is anything to go by, they will understand it as a class-based politics aimed against those who can't afford real estate within biking distance of the city center.
"Why don't we ask the 'no cars!' people how they get their groceries and general supplies?" asked one correspondent in the Inside-Booster, a Chicago community newspaper. "I would venture to guess they are Amazon Prime members, and we can thank their delivery trucks for clogging up our community by double parking while making their deliveries."
We can expect more of this.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A broad, and sometimes quixotic, retail effort to win the fight against global warming is playing out one person at a time, with nary a mention of climate change.
Like many people driving an electric car for the first time, Mikey Marohn had questions: Could he drive hundreds of miles to visit his father without stopping? Where would the chargers be? How did you turn it on?
"I'm anxious," said Mr. Marohn, a 34-year-old carpenter, as he settled behind the wheel of a Chevrolet Bolt near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
But after a test drive with Alicia Cox, executive director of Yellowstone-Teton Clean Cities, a nonprofit group that promotes green transportation, Mr. Marohn had gone from skeptical to curious.
"I would consider it," he said after Ms. Cox explained that he could save $ 3,000 a year in fuel costs if he replaced his Chevy Impala with a Bolt. "I'd like to save money and help the planet."
Green energy and transportation have advanced faster than many experts thought possible a few years ago. But many hurdles remain, including efforts by conservative politicians to prolong the use of coal, oil and gas and campaigns by environmentalists and local residents to block new wind turbines, transmission lines and mines.
Just as important will be persuading people like Mr. Marohn that electric cars, renewable energy and electric heaters and stoves are practical, economical and exciting.
Ms. Cox, who travels Wyoming offering free rides in the Chevy Bolt, is part of a broad, and sometimes quixotic, retail effort to win hearts and minds in the fight against climate change, one person at a time. Biden administration officials are trying to highlight to voters the economic benefits of his energy and industrial policies. Corporations like General Motors, which makes the Bolt, are spending billions of dollars to build electric vehicles they hope to sell everywhere, even in conservative states like Wyoming.
In conversations with activists, policymakers and corporate executives, it becomes clear that a save-the-planet argument doesn't go very far. Most people won't buy green technology unless it will clearly save them money and wows them with stunning designs or jaw-dropping performance.
Many, conservatives in particular, chafe at the prospect of the government forcing them to buy electric cars or ditch their natural gas appliances, polls show. That's perhaps why those pitching the technology often avoid mentioning climate change. They emulate evangelists who don't lead with Jesus when trying to win over nonbelievers.
A clean energy future will require painstaking and individually tailored persuasion campaigns. About half of Americans say they are not interested in buying electric cars, and a little more than half say they have not seriously considered solar panels, heat pumps or electric water heaters, a recent Pew Research Center survey found.
"I never expect anyone to adopt an E.V. on the first go of it," Ms. Cox said. "They need someone walking along beside them as they are making the decision."
Selling Green Energy
Jae Landreth operates a solar installation business in Baldwin City, Kan., a rural town southwest of Kansas City. Though he believes in climate change, he said, he "learned the hard way" not to mention it when marketing solar panels to his neighbors.
"That's not how you sell it," he said over coffee at his home. "Nobody's ever going to make a decision unless it benefits them in a money sense."
Mr. Landreth, an ebullient man who plays percussion in a Phil Collins tribute band, owns a Tesla, an electric off-road vehicle and an electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup he uses for his business, Solar Planet.
His enthusiasm for electric vehicles is hardly the norm in this patch of corn-and-cattle country. It's not unusual for drivers of Teslas and Toyota Prius hybrids to get "coal-rolled" by diesel trucks rigged to produce clouds of black exhaust on demand.
One of Mr. Landreth's customers is Rob Leach, a dairy farmer. Mr. Leach hired Mr. Landreth to install solar panels on his barn when it was rebuilt after a 2019 tornado. The panels power the large fans that were keeping Mr. Leach's cows cool on a July day when the temperature was in the high 90s.
Cost was crucial, according to Mr. Leach. "I said, 'I just want to know at the end of the month, am I going to be paying less even with my investment in solar?' And that has been the case."
Mr. Leach has since encouraged other farmers to install solar panels. "I've had several friends of mine that were, you know, not necessarily trying to save the planet," he said. "They just wanted to save money."
The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats last year allocated hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for wind and solar manufacturing, electric vehicles and other clean energy.
Although no Republicans voted for the bill, much of the money has gone to G.O.P.-led states in the South where many automakers, battery manufacturers and solar companies are building factories in part to take advantage of the law's tax breaks.
Getting credit for the new jobs is a political imperative for President Biden, who will be seeking re-election next year. That helps explains why his energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, spent part of July traversing the Southeast in a caravan of electric vehicles.
Ms. Granholm stopped at universities and elementary schools, a hardware store and a Baptist church. She made the case that federal investment in clean energy is creating thousands of jobs, saving consumers money and even protecting the nation against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has used fossil fuel exports to exert pressure.
Not on Ms. Granholm's list of reasons to go green: climate change.
Sipping black coffee at a Starbucks outside Memphis. Ms. Granholm said she liked to focus on how Biden administration policies were turning the region into a vibrant manufacturing hub. "It's important to lean on the message that makes sense for people where they are."
Jobs and Savings
In North and South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee -- states on Ms. Granholm's itinerary -- solid majorities accept that global warming is real, according to detailed polling by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. But there is widespread skepticism that humans are responsible.
"The climate has always been changing," said Sue Burns, 59, at a gathering of Pontiac car enthusiasts in Murfreesboro, Tenn. "The left is out of control" in insisting that burning fossil fuels is causing a planetary crisis, Ms. Burns said.
Yet Ms. Burns drives a Prius -- a far cry from a Pontiac muscle car -- that runs on an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. She said she had bought the car to save money on gas.
Among residents benefiting from the economic boost, attitudes may be softening. Outside Dalton, Ga., Qcells, a maker of solar panels, is planning to expand a manufacturing plant. The factory is in the congressional district represented by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican who has called fossil fuels "amazing" and climate change a "scam."
William Turner, 49, one of Ms. Greene's constituents, said he didn't "really buy into that stuff" about global warming. But he added, "I don't have anything against solar, especially if it's creating jobs."
The true test of public opinion will come when the promised factories are up and running, said Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of unions and environmental groups.
"Political messaging and press announcements" will not convince anyone, Mr. Walsh said. "But a paycheck might."
In Democratic strongholds, Ms. Granholm's clean energy message went down more smoothly. Yet even there, many people said they needed to think with their pocketbooks, not their principles.
"I care about climate change," said Tia Williams, 29, eating lunch with a friend at the Georgia Institute of Technology before an appearance by Ms. Granholm. But she said she wasn't planning to buy an electric car because they were too expensive.
"I know the corporations love them, but I don't see much use for them myself," Ms. Williams said of federal incentives designed to make electric vehicles more affordable.
Slightly less than half of Democrats say they support phasing out fossil fuels, according to Pew. And just 12 percent of Republicans support doing so. That's perhaps why Mr. Biden tends to emphasize the economic upside of his policies.
In July, Mr. Biden went to South Carolina, where he taunted Republicans who had voted against climate change and infrastructure bills yet were reaping their benefits. Mr. Biden toured Flex, which makes fast chargers for electric cars and is in the district represented by Joe Wilson, a Republican who said the Inflation Reduction Act was "to the detriment of American families."
"Didn't get much help from the other team, but that didn't stop us from getting it done," Mr. Biden told the crowd, speaking of the legislation.
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, said in an interview that Republicans were trying to block or roll back efforts to promote electric trucks and buses, energy efficiency and offshore wind development. But Mr. Cooper predicted that economics would prevail.
"Even if some of them deny the science of climate change, they can't deny good-paying jobs," he said.
Not 'Mission: Impossible'
In Wyoming, where coal, oil, natural gas and souped-up pickups are cherished, Patrick Lawson is fighting a lonely campaign.
A member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, he tries to get local businesses to install charging stations. He takes out his Tesla Model Y and Ford F-150 Lightning as an Uber driver at night, less to make money than to drum up interest in electric vehicles.
Once a year he participates in the Rocky Mountain Rebels Car Show in Riverton, which adjoins his reservation. "I just want to change the perception that electric cars are not as good as big, noisy muscle cars," Mr. Lawson said.
It's a tough sell. During a Friday night "cruise parade" that opened the show, Mr. Lawson's mother, Susan Lawson, drove a red Tesla Model X, its distinctive wing doors open. As she waited in a lumber store parking lot for the parade to start, a middle-age woman approached.
"Wow, it's a Tesla, beautiful car," said the woman, who identified herself only as Cheryl, "a patriot and small business owner."
But then her tone shifted. "I don't believe in electric cars," she said. "The government could turn them off. The government controls our electricity."
A few bystanders on the parade route commented favorably about the Tesla's looks. But there were brickbats, too. "They're on their way to Jackson," someone said, referring to the liberal resort town. "Good luck getting over the pass in that thing," shouted another.
After the Lawsons parked in front of the local Elks lodge, a man pretending to hold a machine gun fired a spray of imaginary bullets at the electric vehicles.
That kind of reaction doesn't deter Mr. Lawson, 42, who manages the tribe's internet company along with his small charging business, Wild West EV.
When Mr. Lawson arranged $ 174,000 to match a federal grant to install charging stations at the city hall and airport, the Riverton City Council declined the money. The one public charging station in town, outside a sandwich shop, is often blocked by trucks, sometimes deliberately parked horizontally to make charging impossible.
During an obstacle race that was part of the car show, another Tesla driver beat all 40 cars. Onlookers were impressed but still skeptical. "It doesn't fit everybody's needs," said Kent Wheeler, a technician at an auto body and paint shop.
Mr. Lawson remains optimistic. "I'm in it for the long haul," he said. "It's not 'Mission: Impossible."'
Ford Motor, G.M. and dozens of other companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to refit factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles. They don't want to make cars that only Democrats buy.
One company confronting the marketing problem is Polaris, a Minnesota company that builds four-wheel off-road vehicles used by hunters and farmers.
In April, Polaris began selling a $ 25,000 electric vehicle called the Ranger XP Kinetic. Advertising barely mentions the environment, instead stressing its performance. The strategy seems to have worked. The initial production run sold out two hours after Polaris began taking orders.
"We knew the target customer," said Josh Hermes, vice president for electric off-road vehicles at Polaris. "We really focused in on the benefits of the product"
One of the first buyers was Paul Rosenzweig, a Georgia resident who is in the wholesale feed business and is skeptical that climate change is caused by mankind. Rather, Mr. Rosenzweig, who hunts deer, rabbit and squirrels in Louisiana, likes how quiet the Polaris is.
"You see more wildlife with electric than you do with the motor burning," he said.
When G.M. begins selling a battery-powered version of its Chevy Silverado pickup this year, it will emphasize the truck's 450-mile range and towing capacity.
The company's chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the cars were winning people over. Customers are "figuring out they're really fun to drive, and it's really nice to not have to go to the gas station," she said in an interview.
There are tentative signs that conservative opposition is wavering.
The Republican-controlled Legislature in Alabama, where Mercedes-Benz makes electric cars and Polaris builds the Kinetic, has allocated $ 1 million a year for a campaign to encourage residents to buy electric vehicles.
"We want to make sure we embrace the jobs and economic opportunities that accompany this new generation of vehicles," Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, said in a statement.
Republican lawmakers in Missouri have sought to block Quinton Lucas, Kansas City's Democratic mayor, from raising the minimum wage, making buildings more energy-efficient and restricting gun ownership. But they have not tried to block Kansas City from buying electric cars and trucks, Mr. Lucas said.
Building inspectors and supervisors in the Fire Department drive electric cars. At the city-owned airport, electric tractors deliver baggage, and electric buses shuttle passengers. The technology saves the city thousands of dollars per vehicle in maintenance and fuel costs.
"They usually notice everything new that we do and often try to pre-empt it," Mr. Lucas said of the Legislature. "And so what that tells me is, actually, I don't see this being a flashpoint."

Medical Mystery Shrouds Drugs for Weight Loss: [National Desk]

Full text: Every so often a drug comes along that has the potential to change the world. Medical specialists say the latest to offer that possibility are the new drugs that treat obesity -- Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and more that may soon be coming onto the market.
It's early, but nothing like these drugs has existed before.
"Game changers," said Jonathan Engel, a historian of medicine and health care policy at Baruch College in New York.
Obesity affects nearly 42 percent of American adults, and yet, Dr. Engel said, "we have been powerless." Research into potential medical treatments for the condition led to failures. Drug companies lost interest, with many executives thinking -- like most doctors and members of the public -- that obesity was a moral failing and not a chronic disease.
While other drugs discovered in recent decades for diseases like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's were found through a logical process that led to clear targets for drug designers, the path that led to the obesity drugs was not like that. In fact, much about the drugs remains shrouded in mystery. Researchers discovered by accident that exposing the brain to a natural hormone at levels never seen in nature elicited weight loss. They really don't know why, or if the drugs may have any long-term side effects.
"Everyone would like to say there must be some logical explanation or order in this that would allow predictions about what will work," said Dr. David D'Alessio, chief of endocrinology at Duke, who consults for Eli Lilly among others. "So far there is not."
Although the drugs seem safe, obesity medicine specialists call for caution because -- like drugs for high cholesterol levels or high blood pressure -- the obesity drugs must be taken indefinitely or patients will regain the weight they lost.
Dr. Susan Yanovski, a co-director of the office of obesity research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, warned that patients would have to be monitored for rare but serious side effects, especially as scientists still don't know why the drugs work.
But, she added, obesity itself is associated with a long list of grave medical problems, including diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, cancers, sleep apnea and joint pain.
"You have to keep in mind the serious diseases and increased mortality that people with obesity suffer from," she said.
The drugs can cause transient nausea and diarrhea in some. But their main effect is what matters. Patients say they lose constant cravings for food. They find themselves satisfied with much smaller portions. They lose weight because they naturally eat less -- not because they burn more calories.
And results from a clinical trial reported last week indicate that Wegovy can do more than help people lose weight -- it also can protect against cardiac complications, like heart attacks and strokes.
But why that happens remains poorly understood.
"Companies don't like the term trial and error," said Dr. Daniel Drucker, who studies diabetes and obesity at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto and who consults for Novo Nordisk and other companies. "They like to say, 'We were extremely clever in the way we designed the molecule," Dr. Drucker said.
But, he said, "They did get lucky."
A Lonely Origin Story
In the 1970s, obesity treatments were the last thing on Dr. Joel Habener's mind. He was an academic endocrinologist starting his own lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and looking for a challenging, but doable, research project.
He chose diabetes. The disease is caused by high blood sugar levels and is typically treated with injections of insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that helps cells store sugar. But an insulin injection makes blood sugar plummet, even if levels are already low. Patients have to carefully plan injections because very low blood sugar levels can result in confusion, shakiness and even a loss of consciousness.
Two other hormones also play a role in regulating blood sugar -- somatostatin and glucagon -- and little was known then about how they are produced. Dr. Habener decided to study the genes that direct cells to make glucagon.
That led him to a real surprise. In the early 1980s, he discovered a hormone, GLP-1, that exquisitely regulates blood sugar. It acts only on insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, and only when blood sugar rises too high.
It was perfect, in theory, as a targeted treatment to replace sledgehammer-like insulin injections.
Another researcher, Dr. Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen, independently stumbled on the same discovery.
But there was a problem: When GLP-1 was injected, it vanished before reaching the pancreas. It needed to last longer.
Dr. Drucker, who led the GLP-1 discovery efforts on Dr. Habener's team, labored for years on the challenge. It was, he said, "a pretty lonely field."
When he applied to the Endocrine Society to give talks, he found himself scheduled at the very end of the last day of the annual meetings.
"Everyone had left for the airport -- people were taking down the exhibits," he said.
From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, he spoke to nearly empty auditoriums.
Dr. Eng's Monster
Success came from a chance discovery that was not appreciated at the time.
In 1990, John Eng, a researcher at the Veterans Affairs medical center in the Bronx, was looking for interesting new hormones in nature that might be useful for medications in people.
He was drawn to the venomous Gila monster when he learned that it somehow kept its blood sugar levels stable when it did not have much to eat, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health, which funded his work. So Dr. Eng decided to search for chemicals in the lizards' saliva. He found a variant of GLP-1 that lasted longer.
Dr. Eng told The New York Times in 2002 that the V.A. had declined to patent the hormone. So Dr. Eng patented it himself and licensed it to Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which began testing it as a diabetes drug. The drug, exenatide or Byetta, went on sale in the United States in 2005.
But Byetta had to be injected twice a day, a real disincentive to its use. Drug company chemists sought even longer-lasting versions of GLP-1.
At Novo Nordisk, chemists began by using a well-known trick. They loosely attached GLP-1 to a blood protein that kept it stable enough to remain in circulation for at least 24 hours. But when GLP-1 slips off the protein, enzymes in the blood quickly degrade it. So chemists had to alter the hormone's building blocks -- a chain of amino acids -- to find a more durable variant.
After tedious trial and error, Novo Nordisk produced liraglutide, a GLP-1 drug that lasted long enough for daily injections. They named it Victoza, and the F.D.A. approved it as a treatment for diabetes in 2010.
It had an unexpected side effect: slight weight loss.
A Dismal History
Obesity had become a dead end in the pharmaceutical industry. No drug that was tried worked very well, and every one that led to even modest weight loss had serious side effects.
For a flickering moment in the late 1990s, there was hope when Dr. Jeffrey Friedman at Rockefeller University in New York found a hormone that told the brain how much fat was on the body. Lab mice genetically modified to have none of the hormone ate voraciously and grew enormously fat. Researchers could fine-tune an animal's weight by altering how much of the hormone it got.
Dr. Friedman named the hormone leptin. Amgen bought the rights to leptin and, in 1996, began testing it in people. They did not lose weight.
Dr. Matthias Tschöp at Helmholtz Munich in Germany tells of the frustration. He left academia three decades ago to work at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, excited by leptin and determined to use science to find a drug for weight loss.
"I was so inspired," Dr. Tschöp said.
When leptin failed, he tried a different gut hormone, ghrelin, whose effects were the opposite of leptin's. The more ghrelin an animal had, the more it would eat. Perhaps a drug that blocked ghrelin would make people lose weight.
"Again, it wasn't that simple," said Dr. Tschöp, who left Lilly in 2002.
The body has so many redundant circuits of interacting nerve impulses and hormones to control weight that tweaking one simply did not make a difference.
And there was another obstacle, noted Dr. Tschöp's former colleague at Lilly, Dr. Richard Di Marchi, who also was an executive at Novo Nordisk.
"There was very little interest in the industry in doing this," said Dr. Di Marchi, now at Indiana University. "Obesity was not thought to be a disease. It was looked at as a behavioral problem."
Starving Rats
Novo Nordisk, which today has 45.7 percent of the global insulin market, thought of itself as a diabetes company. Period.
But one company scientist, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, could not stop thinking about tantalizing results from studies with liraglutide, the GLP-1 drug that lasted long enough to be injected just once a day.
In the early 1990s, Novo researchers, studying rats implanted with tumors of pancreas cells that produced copious amounts of glucagon and GLP-1, noticed that the animals had nearly stopped eating.
"These rats, they starved themselves," Dr. Knudsen said in a video series released by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. "So we kind of knew there was something in some of these peptides that was really important for appetite regulation."
Other studies by academic researchers found that rats lost their appetites if GLP-1 was injected into their brains. Human subjects who got an intravenous drip of GLP-1 ate 12 percent less at a lunch buffet than those who got a placebo.
So why not study liraglutide as both a diabetes drug and an obesity drug, Dr. Knudsen asked.
She faced resistance in part because some company executives were convinced that obesity resulted from a lack of willpower. One of the champions of investigating GLP-1 for weight loss, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, the current chief executive of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and former chief scientific officer of the company, said in the video posted by the foundation that he "had to spend half a year convincing my C.E.O. that obesity is not just a lifestyle condition."
Dr. Knudsen also noted that the company's business division had struggled with the idea of promoting liraglutide for two distinct purposes.
"It's either diabetes, or it's a weight loss," she recalled in the foundation video series.
Finally, after liraglutide was approved in 2010 for diabetes, Dr. Knudsen's proposal to study the drug for weight loss moved forward. After clinical trials, the F.D.A. approved it as Saxenda for obesity in 2014. The dose was about twice the diabetes dose. Patients lost about 5 percent of their weight, a modest amount.
But Dr. Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development at Novo Nordisk, said in a telephone interview that it was at least as good as other weight-loss drugs, and without side effects like heart attacks, strokes and death.
"We were super excited," he said.
Beyond Diabetes
Despite the progress on weight loss, Novo Nordisk continued to focus on diabetes, trying to find ways to make a longer-lasting GLP-1 so patients would not have to inject themselves every day.
The result was a different GLP-1 drug, semaglutide, that lasted long enough that patients had to inject themselves only once a week. It was approved in 2017 and is now marketed as Ozempic.
It also caused weight loss -- 15 percent, which is three times the loss with Saxenda, the once-a-day drug, although there was no obvious reason for that. Suddenly, the company had what looked like a revolutionary treatment for obesity.
But Novo Nordisk could not market Ozempic for weight loss without F.D.A. approval for that specific use.
In 2018, a year after Ozempic's approval for diabetes, the company started a clinical trial. In 2021, Novo Nordisk got approval from the F.D.A. to market the same drug for obesity with a weekly injection at a higher maximum dose. It named the drug Wegovy.
But even before Wegovy was approved, people had begun taking Ozempic for obesity. Novo Nordisk, in its Ozempic commercials, mentioned that many taking it lost weight.
Hinting turned out to be more than enough. Soon, said Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, patients latched onto Ozempic. Doctors prescribed it off label for those who did not have diabetes.
"There was a little bit of gaming going on," Dr. Mechanick said, with some doctors coding patients as having pre-diabetes to help them get insurance coverage.
By 2021, fed by social media, a general frenzy for weight loss and aggressive marketing by Novo Nordisk, the news that Ozempic made people lose weight had reached a tipping point, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, a co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a consultant for Novo Nordisk and other companies. Ozempic was on everyone's lips, even though Wegovy was the drug approved that year for obesity.
But Wegovy caught up.
In July, doctors in the U.S. wrote about 94,000 prescriptions a week for Wegovy compared with about 62,000 a week for Ozempic. Wegovy is in such demand, though, that the company is unable to make enough, its spokeswoman Ambre James-Brown said. So for now, while it ramps up production, the company sells the drug only in Norway, Denmark, Germany and the United States. And at pharmacies in those countries, shortages are frequent.
And Dr. Apovian, like many other obesity medicine specialists, is now booked with patients a year in advance.
More Medicines, More Mysteries
The reason Ozempic and Wegovy are so much more effective than Saxenda remains a mystery. Why should a once-a-week injection produce much more weight loss than a once-a-day injection?
The drugs, said Randy Seeley, an obesity researcher at the University of Michigan, are not correcting for a lack of GLP-1 in the body -- people with obesity make plenty of GLP-1. Instead, the drugs are exposing the brain to hormone levels never seen in nature. Patients taking Wegovy are getting five times the amount of GLP-1 that they would produce in response to a Thanksgiving dinner, Dr. Seeley said.
And, he added, in the brain, "the drugs go to unusual places." They are not just going to areas thought to control overeating.
"If you were designing a drug, you would say that's a bad idea," said Dr. Seeley, who has consulted for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, among others. Drug designers try for precision -- a drug should go only to the cells where it is needed.
GLP-1, because of its chemical structure, should not even get into some areas of the brain where it slips in.
"Nobody understands that," Dr. Seeley said.
Wegovy, though, is just the start.
Lilly's diabetes drug, tirzepatide or Mounjaro, is expected to get F.D.A. approval for obesity this year. It hooks GLP-1 to another gut hormone, GIP.
GIP, on its own, produces, at best, a modest weight loss. But the two-hormone combination can allow people to lose a median of about 20 percent of their weight.
"No one fully understands why," Dr. Drucker said.
Lilly has another drug, retatrutide, that, while still in early stages of testing, seems to elicit a median 24 percent weight loss.
Amgen's experimental drug, AMG 133, could be even better, but is even more of a puzzle. It hooks GLP-1 to a molecule that blocks GIP.
There is no logical explanation for why seemingly opposite approaches would work.
Researchers continue to marvel at these biochemical mysteries. But doctors and patients have their own takeaway: The drugs work. People lose weight. The constant chatter in their brains about food and eating is gone.
And, while the stigma of obesity and the cultural stereotype that obese people aren't trying hard enough to lose weight endures, some experts are optimistic. Now, they say, patients no longer have to blame themselves or feel like failures when they can't lose weight.
"The era of 'just go out and diet and exercise' is now gone,"' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, a professor of diabetes research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. "Now clinicians have tools to address obesity."

Every so often a drug comes along that has the potential to change the world. Medical specialists say the latest to offer that possibility are the new drugs that treat obesity — Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and more that may soon be coming onto the market.
It’s early, but nothing like these drugs has existed before.
“Game changers,” said Jonathan Engel, a historian of medicine and health care policy at Baruch College in New York.
Obesity affects nearly 42% of American adults, and yet, Engel said, “we have been powerless.” Research into potential medical treatments for the condition led to failures. Drug companies lost interest, with many executives thinking — like most doctors and members of the public — that obesity was a moral failing and not a chronic disease.
While other drugs discovered in recent decades for diseases like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer’s were found through a logical process that led to clear targets for drug designers, the path that led to the obesity drugs was not like that. In fact, much about the drugs remains shrouded in mystery. Researchers discovered by accident that exposing the brain to a natural hormone at levels never seen in nature elicited weight loss. They really don’t know why, or if the drugs may have any long-term side effects.
“Everyone would like to say there must be some logical explanation or order in this that would allow predictions about what will work,” said Dr. David D’Alessio, chief of endocrinology at Duke, who consults for Eli Lilly among others. “So far there is not.”
Although the drugs seem safe, obesity medicine specialists call for caution because — like drugs for high cholesterol levels or high blood pressure — the obesity drugs must be taken indefinitely or patients will regain the weight they lost.
Dr. Susan Yanovski, a co-director of the office of obesity research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, warned that patients would have to be monitored for rare but serious side effects, especially as scientists still don’t know why the drugs work.
But, she added, obesity itself is associated with a long list of grave medical problems, including diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, cancers, sleep apnea and joint pain.
“You have to keep in mind the serious diseases and increased mortality that people with obesity suffer from,” she said.
The drugs can cause transient nausea and diarrhea in some. But their main effect is what matters. Patients say they lose constant cravings for food. They find themselves satisfied with much smaller portions. They lose weight because they naturally eat less — not because they burn more calories.
And results from a clinical trial reported last week indicate that Wegovy can do more than help people lose weight — it also can protect against cardiac complications, like heart attacks and strokes.
But why that happens remains poorly understood.
“Companies don’t like the term trial and error,” said Dr. Daniel Drucker, who studies diabetes and obesity at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto and who consults for Novo Nordisk and other companies. “They like to say, ‘We were extremely clever in the way we designed the molecule,” Drucker said.
But, he said, “They did get lucky.”
A Lonely Origin Story
In the 1970s, obesity treatments were the last thing on Dr. Joel Habener’s mind. He was an academic endocrinologist starting his own lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and looking for a challenging, but doable, research project.
He chose diabetes. The disease is caused by high blood sugar levels and is typically treated with injections of insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that helps cells store sugar. But an insulin injection makes blood sugar plummet, even if levels are already low. Patients have to carefully plan injections because very low blood sugar levels can result in confusion, shakiness and even a loss of consciousness.
Two other hormones also play a role in regulating blood sugar — somatostatin and glucagon — and little was known then about how they are produced. Habener decided to study the genes that direct cells to make glucagon.
That led him to a real surprise. In the early 1980s, he discovered a hormone, GLP-1, that exquisitely regulates blood sugar. It acts only on insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, and only when blood sugar rises too high.
It was perfect, in theory, as a targeted treatment to replace sledgehammer-like insulin injections.
Another researcher, Dr. Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen, independently stumbled on the same discovery.
But there was a problem: When GLP-1 was injected, it vanished before reaching the pancreas. It needed to last longer.
Drucker, who led the GLP-1 discovery efforts on Habener’s team, labored for years on the challenge. It was, he said, “a pretty lonely field.”
When he applied to the Endocrine Society to give talks, he found himself scheduled at the very end of the last day of the annual meetings.
“Everyone had left for the airport — people were taking down the exhibits,” he said.
From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, he spoke to nearly empty auditoriums.
Eng’s Monster
Success came from a chance discovery that was not appreciated at the time.
In 1990, John Eng, a researcher at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx in New York City, was looking for interesting new hormones in nature that might be useful for medications in people.
He was drawn to the venomous Gila monster when he learned that it somehow kept its blood sugar levels stable when it did not have much to eat, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health, which funded his work. So Eng decided to search for chemicals in the lizards’ saliva. He found a variant of GLP-1 that lasted longer.
Eng told The New York Times in 2002 that the VA had declined to patent the hormone. So Eng patented it himself and licensed it to Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which began testing it as a diabetes drug. The drug, exenatide or Byetta, went on sale in the United States in 2005.
But Byetta had to be injected twice a day, a real disincentive to its use. Drug company chemists sought even longer-lasting versions of GLP-1.
At Novo Nordisk, chemists began by using a well-known trick. They loosely attached GLP-1 to a blood protein that kept it stable enough to remain in circulation for at least 24 hours. But when GLP-1 slips off the protein, enzymes in the blood quickly degrade it. So chemists had to alter the hormone’s building blocks — a chain of amino acids — to find a more durable variant.
After tedious trial and error, Novo Nordisk produced liraglutide, a GLP-1 drug that lasted long enough for daily injections. They named it Victoza, and the Food and Drug Administration approved it as a treatment for diabetes in 2010.
It had an unexpected side effect: slight weight loss.
A Dismal History
Obesity had become a dead end in the pharmaceutical industry. No drug that was tried worked very well, and every one that led to even modest weight loss had serious side effects.
For a flickering moment in the late 1990s, there was hope when Dr. Jeffrey Friedman at Rockefeller University in New York found a hormone that told the brain how much fat was on the body. Lab mice genetically modified to have none of the hormone ate voraciously and grew enormously fat. Researchers could fine-tune an animal’s weight by altering how much of the hormone it got.
Friedman named the hormone leptin. Amgen bought the rights to leptin and, in 1996, began testing it in people. They did not lose weight.
Dr. Matthias Tschöp at Helmholtz Munich in Germany tells of the frustration. He left academia three decades ago to work at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, excited by leptin and determined to use science to find a drug for weight loss.
“I was so inspired,” Tschöp said.
When leptin failed, he tried a different gut hormone, ghrelin, whose effects were the opposite of leptin’s. The more ghrelin an animal had, the more it would eat. Perhaps a drug that blocked ghrelin would make people lose weight.
“Again, it wasn’t that simple,” said Tschöp, who left Lilly in 2002.
The body has so many redundant circuits of interacting nerve impulses and hormones to control weight that tweaking one simply did not make a difference.
And there was another obstacle, noted Tschöp’s former colleague at Lilly, Richard Di Marchi, who also was an executive at Novo Nordisk.
“There was very little interest in the industry in doing this,” said Di Marchi, now at Indiana University. “Obesity was not thought to be a disease. It was looked at as a behavioral problem.”
Starving Rats
Novo Nordisk, which today has 45.7% of the global insulin market, thought of itself as a diabetes company. Period.
But one company scientist, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, could not stop thinking about tantalizing results from studies with liraglutide, the GLP-1 drug that lasted long enough to be injected just once a day.
In the early 1990s, Novo researchers, studying rats implanted with tumors of pancreas cells that produced copious amounts of glucagon and GLP-1, noticed that the animals had nearly stopped eating.
“These rats, they starved themselves,” Knudsen said in a video series released by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. “So we kind of knew there was something in some of these peptides that was really important for appetite regulation.”
Other studies by academic researchers found that rats lost their appetites if GLP-1 was injected into their brains. Human subjects who got an intravenous drip of GLP-1 ate 12% less at a lunch buffet than those who got a placebo.
So why not study liraglutide as both a diabetes drug and an obesity drug, Knudsen asked.
She faced resistance in part because some company executives were convinced that obesity resulted from a lack of willpower. One of the champions of investigating GLP-1 for weight loss, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, the current CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and former chief scientific officer of the company, said in the video posted by the foundation that he “had to spend half a year convincing my CEO that obesity is not just a lifestyle condition.”
Knudsen also noted that the company’s business division had struggled with the idea of promoting liraglutide for two distinct purposes.
“It’s either diabetes, or it’s a weight loss,” she recalled in the foundation video series.
Finally, after liraglutide was approved in 2010 for diabetes, Knudsen’s proposal to study the drug for weight loss moved forward. After clinical trials, the FDA approved it as Saxenda for obesity in 2014. The dose was about twice the diabetes dose. Patients lost about 5% of their weight, a modest amount.
But Dr. Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development at Novo Nordisk, said in a telephone interview that it was at least as good as other weight-loss drugs, and without side effects like heart attacks, strokes and death.
“We were super excited,” he said.
Beyond Diabetes
Despite the progress on weight loss, Novo Nordisk continued to focus on diabetes, trying to find ways to make a longer-lasting GLP-1 so patients would not have to inject themselves every day.
The result was a different GLP-1 drug, semaglutide, that lasted long enough that patients had to inject themselves only once a week. It was approved in 2017 and is now marketed as Ozempic.
It also caused weight loss — 15%, which is three times the loss with Saxenda, the once-a-day drug, although there was no obvious reason for that. Suddenly, the company had what looked like a revolutionary treatment for obesity.
But Novo Nordisk could not market Ozempic for weight loss without FDA approval for that specific use.
In 2018, a year after Ozempic’s approval for diabetes, the company started a clinical trial. In 2021, Novo Nordisk got approval from the FDA to market the same drug for obesity with a weekly injection at a higher maximum dose. It named the drug Wegovy.
But even before Wegovy was approved, people had begun taking Ozempic for obesity. Novo Nordisk, in its Ozempic commercials, mentioned that many taking it lost weight.
Hinting turned out to be more than enough. Soon, said Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, patients latched onto Ozempic. Doctors prescribed it off label for those who did not have diabetes.
“There was a little bit of gaming going on,” Mechanick said, with some doctors coding patients as having pre-diabetes to help them get insurance coverage.
By 2021, fed by social media, a general frenzy for weight loss and aggressive marketing by Novo Nordisk, the news that Ozempic made people lose weight had reached a tipping point, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, a co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a consultant for Novo Nordisk and other companies. Ozempic was on everyone’s lips, even though Wegovy was the drug approved that year for obesity.
But Wegovy caught up.
In July, doctors in the U.S. wrote about 94,000 prescriptions a week for Wegovy compared with about 62,000 a week for Ozempic. Wegovy is in such demand, though, that the company is unable to make enough, its spokesperson, Ambre James-Brown said. So for now, while it ramps up production, the company sells the drug only in Norway, Denmark, Germany and the United States. And at pharmacies in those countries, shortages are frequent.
And Apovian, like many other obesity medicine specialists, is now booked with patients a year in advance.
More Medicines, More Mysteries
The reason Ozempic and Wegovy are so much more effective than Saxenda remains a mystery. Why should a once-a-week injection produce much more weight loss than a once-a-day injection?
The drugs, said Randy Seeley, an obesity researcher at the University of Michigan, are not correcting for a lack of GLP-1 in the body — people with obesity make plenty of GLP-1. Instead, the drugs are exposing the brain to hormone levels never seen in nature. Patients taking Wegovy are getting five times the amount of GLP-1 that they would produce in response to a Thanksgiving dinner, Seeley said.
And, he added, in the brain, “the drugs go to unusual places.” They are not just going to areas thought to control overeating.
“If you were designing a drug, you would say that’s a bad idea,” said Seeley, who has consulted for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, among others. Drug designers try for precision — a drug should go only to the cells where it is needed.
GLP-1, because of its chemical structure, should not even get into some areas of the brain where it slips in.
“Nobody understands that,” Seeley said.
Wegovy, though, is just the start.
Lilly’s diabetes drug, tirzepatide or Mounjaro, is expected to get FDA approval for obesity this year. It hooks GLP-1 to another gut hormone, GIP.
GIP, on its own, produces, at best, a modest weight loss. But the two-hormone combination can allow people to lose a median of about 20% of their weight.
“No one fully understands why,” Drucker said.
Lilly has another drug, retatrutide, that, while still in early stages of testing, seems to elicit a median 24% weight loss.
Amgen’s experimental drug, AMG 133, could be even better, but is even more of a puzzle. It hooks GLP-1 to a molecule that blocks GIP.
There is no logical explanation for why seemingly opposite approaches would work.
Researchers continue to marvel at these biochemical mysteries. But doctors and patients have their own takeaway: The drugs work. People lose weight. The constant chatter in their brains about food and eating is gone.
And, while the stigma of obesity and the cultural stereotype that obese people aren’t trying hard enough to lose weight endures, some experts are optimistic. Now, they say, patients no longer have to blame themselves or feel like failures when they can’t lose weight.
“The era of ‘just go out and diet and exercise’ is now gone,’” said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, a professor of diabetes research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “Now clinicians have tools to address obesity.”

Full text: Out on the road with nowhere to plug in -- that's the greatest fear of many would-be electric vehicle buyers and why they're staying on the sidelines. And that's why a group of automakers is planning to build 30,000 fast charging points in North America.
The joint venture by seven carmakers -- BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis -- would nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States. Those chargers can replenish a drained battery in 10 to 30 minutes.
While most E.V. owners typically charge their vehicles at home overnight, they need fast charging stations for longer trips. But the chargers can be far-flung in sparsely populated areas.
At the moment, Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States. Last month, Ford Motor and G.M. struck a deal that would allow them to adopt Tesla's charging technology, and separately Tesla has pledged to make more of its chargers available to other car brands. The collaboration announced on Wednesday would give the automakers an option other than Tesla for charging.
Installing so many charging stations will be costly -- $ 1 billion -- and will take until the end of the decade to complete, though some chargers will be in place around the middle of next year.
But major carmakers have already invested billions to produce electric vehicles and want to ensure that the vehicles catch on. Shoring up charging infrastructure may be a necessary to getting car buyers over a major psychological hurdle.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," said Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M.
"We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold."

Fire Dept. Community Service Is Likely for Pete Davidson: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The former "Saturday Night Live" cast member faced a reckless driving charge in California. His father, a New York City firefighter, was killed responding to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Pete Davidson, the comedian, actor and former "Saturday Night Live" cast member, has reached an agreement that allows him to resolve a reckless driving charge in California by doing community service with the New York Fire Department, officials said on Monday.
Mr. Davidson, 29, is a Staten Island native. His father, Scott, was a New York City firefighter who died while responding to the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 -- an experience that helped inform Mr. Davidson's 2020 film, "The King of Staten Island."
The reckless driving charge, a misdemeanor, was filed against Mr. Davidson last month by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. It said he crashed a Mercedes-Benz into a house near Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in March, The Los Angeles Times reported. No one was injured, The Times reported.
On July 19, a judge placed Mr. Davidson, who pleaded not guilty, into an 18-month diversion program, according to a statement from the district attorney's office on Monday. He must pay restitution, attend 12 hours of traffic school, visit a hospital and a morgue to learn about what happens to victims of reckless driving and perform 50 hours of community service.
Mr. Davidson's lawyer has indicated that the community service "is likely to be completed at" the New York Fire Department, the statement said. Details of the diversion program were reported earlier by TMZ.
Mr. Davidson's lawyer, Mike Cavalluzzi, did not respond to a request for comment.
Amanda Farinacci, a Fire Department spokeswoman, called Mr. Davidson "the son of a 9/11 hero" and, without offering details, said the department "would be happy to provide" him a chance to complete his service. (Mr. Davidson can also complete the diversion program's other terms in New York, the district attorney's office said. Because New York does not have a hospital and morgue program like California's, he will have to find something comparable.)
A stand-up comic before joining the "Saturday Night Live" cast in fall 2014, Mr. Davidson left the NBC show after the season finale last year. His most recent project is the streaming series "Bupkis."
Doing his community service in New York could allow Mr. Davidson to check up on another project tied to his Staten Island roots: a decommissioned ferry that he and Colin Jost, a fellow "Saturday Night Live" cast member -- and fellow Staten Islander -- bought last year with other investors for $ 280,000.
One vision for the aging vessel involved turning it into what one of the investors called an "arts and entertainment venue." But Mr. Davidson sounded uncertain about the ferry's future in an interview with "Entertainment Tonight" last month.
"I have no idea what's going on with that thing," he said. "Me and Colin were very stoned a year ago and bought a ferry. And we're figuring it out."

Full text: The companies will jointly spend at least $ 1 billion to build a North American network in an effort to persuade more people to buy battery-powered cars and trucks.
Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- will initially invest at least $ 1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers -- those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford Motor and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, G.M. and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, said. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, though, so far, it has made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and G.M. plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly -- taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren't many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Ms. Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
"In states where E.V. adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers," she said. "That is where you are going to have the most impact."
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the chief executive of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
"The most mature market is California, and we're not saturated in California yet," Ms. Zoi said. "Potential buyers of E.V.s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations."
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with G.M. to build fast-charging stations, and Ms. Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state's northern city, Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Tesla Wants to Double the Size Of Its German Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric automaker wants to produce a million cars a year at its plant near Berlin, a step that would make it Europe's largest car factory.
Tesla wants to double the production capacity of its assembly plant outside Berlin to one million electric vehicles a year, a move that would make it the largest car plant in Europe at a time when German automakers are struggling to keep pace in the transition to electric vehicles.
Since it began production in Grünheide 16 months ago, Tesla has disrupted the German automobile landscape. Over the first half of this year, for the first time, it eclipsed Volkswagen in electric vehicle sales.
If the expansion, detailed in thousands of pages made public on Wednesday, wins the approval of local officials, the plant's output will surpass that of Volkswagen's landmark factory in Wolfsburg, which was built in the 1930s and has remained Europe's largest, able to roll out 815,000 cars a year.
Volkswagen and other German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have spent years fumbling their attempts to produce electric cars that can compete with Tesla in price and popularity. Across the continent in June, new registrations of electric cars increased more than 66 percent from a year earlier, outselling diesel cars for the first time, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
Since March 2022, Tesla's German plant has been producing about 5,000 Model Y sport utility vehicles each week -- a pace that is roughly half of its current capacity, which is still ramping up. The company said it would like to add capacity to build other models at the plant, but did not specify which ones. It is also seeking to double its production of battery cells, up to a storage capacity of 100 gigawatt hours per year, the expansion documents show.
The number of employees would rise to 22,500, up from 10,000 now, the company told residents at a town hall-style event near the plant on Tuesday. Dozens of jobs are advertised on the company's website, the majority of them in manufacturing, indicating the company still has openings in the current plant.
Dirk Schulze, the regional head of the IG Metall labor union, which counts 2.3 million workers nationwide among its ranks, welcomed the announcement of more jobs in the economically weak region. But he called for better working conditions for those on the job.
"Despite high levels of sick leave, staff are being cut on a significant scale," Mr. Schulze said. "But production targets are not being adjusted downward, so pressure on the remaining colleagues is increasing."
IG Metall has been frustrated at its inability to attract enough workers to produce a collective-bargaining agreement for employees at the plant. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has been blunt about his opposition to unions.
Local residents and organizations have one month to examine the plans and submit any concerns to authorities. A public hearing is to be held in October.
Tesla has encountered resistance from residents in the area since the plant was first proposed in 2019; they are concerned that the existing factory will be a drain on the groundwater. The expansion plans include construction of a water treatment facility, which would allow the factory to recycle water instead of expanding its use of resources.

E.V. Prices Fall as Automakers Raise Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Ford, Tesla and other automakers are having to lower prices to lure buyers as the supply of battery-powered models begins to exceed demand.
After struggling to find enough batteries and other parts for the past couple of years, automakers are finally beginning to churn out large numbers of electric cars and trucks. More than 30 new models will arrive in showrooms this year.
What they need now are more customers.
While sales of electric vehicles are increasing -- they climbed about 48 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier -- they are not rising fast enough to keep pace with the number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines. And inventories of unsold vehicles are starting to pile up.
More than 90,000 battery-powered cars and trucks are sitting on dealer lots, four times as many as a year ago, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. That's enough to last 103 days at the current rate of sales, compared with about 50 days for the industry as a whole.
Manufacturers "are having a 'Field of Dreams' moment," said Jonathan Gregory, a senior manager of economic and industry insight at Cox. "They have built E.V. inventory, but now they wait for buyers to come."
In view of this unbalanced supply and demand, automakers are cutting prices and offering more incentives. On Monday, Ford Motor reduced prices of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck by $ 6,000 to nearly $ 10,000, or as much as 17 percent on some versions. The company is also offering discounted interest rates of 1.9 percent to 3.9 percent on certain loans for Lightning purchases.
These moves follow several rounds of price cuts by Tesla, the dominant seller of electric cars. Tesla's price reductions earlier prompted Ford to lower prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle, although that hasn't brought Mach-E inventory back in line with sales.
At the end of June, Ford dealers had 16,400 of that model in stock -- about 2,000 more than they sold in the first six months of the year.
While many consumers express interest in electric vehicles, they are often not ready to go through with a purchase. Many people have been put off by high prices of electric cars and are waiting for them to cost no more than comparable gasoline models -- something that could be hastened by recent price cuts.
Other car buyers have concerns about how far these cars and trucks can travel on a full charge. Many models now available need to be recharged after traveling 200 to 250 miles. Uncertainty about finding charging stations and how long it takes to charge the vehicles can put off some people.
Glenn Staub, a personal trainer from White Plains, N.Y., said he wanted to buy a hybrid or fully electric car because of the potential environmental benefits and the savings on fuel costs. But he's not going to be in the market until his 2014 Toyota Corolla conks out.
"My policy for keeping cars is I drive it until it's not serviceable anymore," he said. That might not be for a few years; his Corolla has been driven just under 100,000 miles and runs fine.
Sales have become particularly sluggish for high-priced luxury models -- a segment of the market that has a surfeit of options from the likes of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lucid Motors. Many of these cars cost $ 75,000 to $ 160,000.
"I think there was a lot of hype about E.V.s, and people did their research and realized these are premium vehicles and they're not cheap," said Rick Ricart, president of Ricart Automotive, which owns nine new-car franchises in Dublin, Ohio. "And there's been some pullback."
Mr. Ricart said his family's Ford store had a top-of-the-line F-150 Lightning Platinum truck on sale for $ 92,000 for more than two months. "A year ago, it would have been sold by now," he said.
Another group of electric vehicles that are struggling to find buyers are those that no longer qualify for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's ambitious climate change law. The credit is available only on cars that are assembled in North America and that include a certain percentage of battery materials from the region or from U.S. trade partners.
In addition to those restrictions, electric sedans have to sell for $ 55,000 or less to be eligible for credits, and S.U.V.s, pickup trucks and vans have to sell for $ 80,000 or less.
Purchases of Ford's Lightning trucks can make buyers eligible for the $ 7,500 credit, and the company is planning to sell a lot more of the pickups in the coming months. The company temporarily halted production this year to upgrade its assembly line and increase output. By the fall, the company expects its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center near Detroit to be able to churn out 150,000 Lightnings a year, triple its current production capacity.
The company's decision to lower prices may also have something to do with the growing competition in the electric vehicle business. Tesla said on Saturday that it had started producing its much-delayed Cybertruck pickup, and General Motors is expected to soon begin delivering an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado truck.
Ford began making the Lightning in spring 2022 and raised prices several times by a total of around $ 20,000, citing increasing cost of raw materials for its batteries. At the time, demand far outstripped Ford's production, and some dealers were charging thousands of dollars more than the company's suggested retail price.
"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the E.V. truck for Ford and our customers," Marin Gjaja, the chief customer officer for the automaker's electric vehicle division, said in a statement. "We've continued to work in the background to improve accessibility to help lower prices for our customers and shorten wait times."
The company's decision to cut prices unnerved investors who feared it would hurt Ford's profits, and its stock price fell 6 percent on Monday.
Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $ 49,995, a reduction of $ 9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $ 8,879, to $ 69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $ 91,995, or $ 6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $ 80,000, making them eligible for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.

Manufacturers “are having a ‘Field of Dreams’ moment,” said Jonathan Gregory, a senior manager of economic and industry insight at Cox. “They have built EV inventory, but now they wait for buyers to come.”
In view of this unbalanced supply and demand, automakers are cutting prices and offering more incentives. On Monday, Ford Motor Co. reduced prices of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck by $6,000 to nearly $10,000, or as much as 17% on some versions. The company is also offering discounted interest rates of 1.9% to 3.9% on certain loans for Lightning purchases.
These moves follow several rounds of price cuts by Tesla, the dominant seller of electric cars. Tesla’s price reductions earlier prompted Ford to lower prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle, although that hasn’t brought Mach-E inventory back in line with sales.
At the end of June, Ford dealers had 16,400 of that model in stock — about 2,000 more than they sold in the first six months of the year.
While many consumers express interest in electric vehicles, they are often not ready to go through with a purchase. Many people have been put off by high prices of electric cars and are waiting for them to cost no more than comparable gasoline models — something that could be hastened by recent price cuts.
Other car buyers have concerns about how far these cars and trucks can travel on a full charge. Many models now available need to be recharged after traveling 200 to 250 miles. Uncertainty about finding charging stations and how long it takes to charge the vehicles can put off some people.
Glenn Staub, a personal trainer from White Plains, New York, said he wanted to buy a hybrid or fully electric car because of the potential environmental benefits and the savings on fuel costs. But he’s not going to be in the market until his 2014 Toyota Corolla conks out.
“My policy for keeping cars is I drive it until it’s not serviceable anymore,” he said. That might not be for a few years; his Corolla has been driven just under 100,000 miles and runs fine.
Sales have become particularly sluggish for high-priced luxury models — a segment of the market that has a surfeit of options from the likes of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lucid Motors. Many of these cars cost $75,000 to $160,000.
“I think there was a lot of hype about EVs, and people did their research and realized these are premium vehicles and they’re not cheap,” said Rick Ricart, president of Ricart Automotive, which owns nine new-car franchises in Dublin, Ohio. “And there’s been some pullback.”
Ricart said his family’s Ford store had a top-of-the-line F-150 Lightning Platinum truck on sale for $92,000 for more than two months. “A year ago, it would have been sold by now,” he said.
Another group of electric vehicles that are struggling to find buyers are those that no longer qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate change law. The credit is available only on cars that are assembled in North America and that include a certain percentage of battery materials from the region or from U.S. trade partners.
In addition to those restrictions, electric sedans have to sell for $55,000 or less to be eligible for credits, and SUVs, pickup trucks and vans have to sell for $80,000 or less.
Purchases of Ford’s Lightning trucks can make buyers eligible for the $7,500 credit, and the company is planning to sell a lot more of the pickups in the coming months. The company temporarily halted production this year to upgrade its assembly line and increase output. By the fall, the company expects its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center near Detroit to be able to churn out 150,000 Lightnings a year, triple its current production capacity.
The company’s decision to lower prices may also have something to do with the growing competition in the electric vehicle business. Tesla said Saturday that it had started producing its much-delayed Cybertruck pickup, and General Motors is expected to soon begin delivering an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado truck.
Ford began making the Lightning in spring 2022 and raised prices several times by a total of around $20,000, citing increasing cost of raw materials for its batteries. At the time, demand far outstripped Ford’s production, and some dealers were charging thousands of dollars more than the company’s suggested retail price.
“Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the EV truck for Ford and our customers,” Marin Gjaja, the chief customer officer for the automaker’s electric vehicle division, said in a statement. “We’ve continued to work in the background to improve accessibility to help lower prices for our customers and shorten wait times.”
Ford’s decision to cut prices unnerved investors who feared it would hurt profits, and its stock price fell 6% on Monday.
Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $49,995, a reduction of $9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $8,879, to $69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $91,995, or $6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $80,000, making them eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Full text: Carlee Russell told a 911 dispatcher on Thursday night that there was a toddler walking along the side of an interstate, the police said. She was not seen again until late Saturday.
A 25-year-old woman in Alabama who was reported missing on Thursday night after telling a 911 dispatcher that she saw a toddler walking along the side of an interstate and would pull over to help was found late on Saturday, according to the police.
The woman, Carlee Russell, showed up at her family's front door, knocked and was greeted by her stunned relatives, said Nicholas Derzis, the police chief in Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham.
He said he was not sure how Ms. Russell got there, but nobody was with her when she arrived. She was taken to a hospital for evaluation.
Dispatchers at Hoover 911 received a call at 10:45 p.m. on Saturday that said Ms. Russell had returned home, the police said in a statement.
Her return ended a sprawling statewide search that had captured national attention and caused widespread speculation about what might have happened before her disappearance.
The circumstances of her sudden vanishing remained unclear on Sunday.
The case began on Thursday night when Ms. Russell told the dispatcher about the child around 9:35 p.m., called a family member to report the same details, and then pulled over on I-459 South near mile marker 11 to check on the toddler, the Hoover Police Department said.
The family member "lost contact" with Ms. Russell, but the line remained open, the police said.
When officers arrived at the site in Hoover, they found Ms. Russell's vehicle and some of her belongings nearby, "but were unable to find her or a child in the area," the police said in a statement.
The Hoover Police Department said it had not received any calls of someone missing a child.
Talitha Russell, the mother of Carlee Russell, said in an interview on Saturday night -- hours before the younger Ms. Russell was found -- that her daughter, who is known as a "kindhearted" soul and is always "the life of the party," was having a busy and meaningful summer, working a part-time job at the Woodhouse Spa in Birmingham and taking nursing classes at Jefferson State Community College.
Talitha Russell did not immediately respond to interview requests after her daughter was found.
On Sunday afternoon, she posted a statement on Facebook on behalf of her family and said they wanted privacy "to allow us to just love on our daughter and each other with our close family and friends."
The family had not slept for three nights and were "mentally and physically exhausted," the statement said.
On Thursday night, Ms. Russell -- who graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology from Auburn University at Montgomery -- finished her shift at the spa around 8:20 p.m., drove to a Mediterranean restaurant to pick up a chicken roll-up for her mother and was on her way home in Hoover when she noticed what appeared to be a small child on the side of an interstate, Talitha Russell said.
Ms. Russell first called the dispatcher who, according to Talitha Russell, told her to stay with the child until the police arrived. Ms. Russell then called her brother's girlfriend, whose name was not shared. The girlfriend remained on the phone and listened as Ms. Russell got out of the car and called to the child, Talitha Russell said.
There was no response, but then the girlfriend heard a scream from the phone that appeared to come from Ms. Russell.
It sounded like the phone was dropped, and then all that could be heard was background noise of vehicles rolling by on the highway, Talitha Russell said.
The girlfriend immediately told the family what had happened, prompting Talitha Russell and her husband to use a phone feature that showed them Ms. Russell's location.
They rushed to the spot on the interstate and saw their daughter's car, its driver-side door open and engine still running. Her hat and wig were on the ground beside the car, and her phone was in a different nearby spot, Talitha Russell said.
Police officers were already at the scene. They used drones to search for Ms. Russell that night as her family drove across other suburbs, looking for her.
Among the most puzzling details about the case is how no other driver on the heavily traversed interstate managed to spot a toddler walking on the side of the road that night, an image that would have surely prompted more 911 calls than just Ms. Russell's.
"That is a little unusual," Chief Derzis said on Saturday night before Ms. Russell was found.
"The thing that we do know is that her car was on the interstate, and she was not when we got there, and that's what we're trying to figure out," he added.
The Hoover Police Department obtained traffic footage that appeared to show the moment that Ms. Russell flashed her back emergency taillights on the interstate, called 911 to report the child and pulled over her red Mercedes-Benz, Chief Derzis said, noting that the video was very grainy and investigators were working on clarifying it.
Al.com reported on the footage on Saturday.
"From the time that she stopped to the time that the first officer hits the blue lights and gets to the scene -- we do not see another vehicle pull over or anything like that," Chief Derzis said.
An early tip about a gray vehicle with a man standing outside of Ms. Russell's vehicle was discounted after the footage review, the chief added.

Amazon Challenges
Digital Standards in E.U.
Amazon is disputing its status as a big online platform that needs to face stricter scrutiny under European Union digital rules taking effect next month, the first Silicon Valley tech giant to push back on the pioneering new standards.
The online retailer filed a legal challenge with a top European Union court, arguing it's being treated unfairly by being designated a "very large online platform" under the 27-nation bloc's sweeping Digital Services Act.
The Digital Services Act imposes new obligations on the biggest tech companies to keep users safe from illegal content and questionable products, with violations punishable by heavy fines or even a ban on operating in the E.U.
Seattle-based Amazon is one of 19 companies classed as the largest online platforms and search engines under the DSA, which means they will have to better police their services to protect European users from hate speech, disinformation and other harmful online content. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Daimler Truck Is Rosy
On Its Future Revenue
Daimler Truck expects revenues to grow as much as 60 percent between 2025 and 2030, top management of the truck and bus maker told investors on Tuesday.
The company's optimistic outlook, presented at a capital markets day in Boston, comes a year after Daimler Truck became an independently listed company in a spinoff from Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, and as it focuses on building autonomous trucks.
Daimler Truck shares rose 2.5 percent.
Easing supply chain constraints and stronger demand in its core markets and the after-sales business prompted the company late on Monday to raise its profit and revenue guidance for 2023.
"We are sold out for 2023," C.E.O. Martin Daum said on Tuesday. In Europe, the company is seeing strong orders for the first quarter of 2024, he said.
Mr. Daum said he would soon announce a partnership with a battery cell producer in the United States, in response to government incentives. REUTERS

O.E.C.D. Says A.I. Puts27 Percent of Jobs at Risk
More than a quarter of jobs in the 38-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development rely on skills that could be easily automated in the coming artificial intelligence revolution, and workers fear they could lose their jobs to A.I., the O.E.C.D. said on Tuesday.
There is little evidence the emergence of A.I. is having a significant impact on jobs so far, but that may be because the revolution is in its early stages, the O.E.C.D. said.
Jobs with the highest risk of being automated make up 27 percent of the labor force on average in O.E.C.D. countries, with eastern European countries most exposed, the organization said in its 2023 Employment Outlook.
Three out of five workers fear they could lose their job to A.I. over the next 10 years, the O.E.C.D. found in a survey last year before the explosive emergence of generative A.I. like ChatGPT. REUTERS

Jury Rules That Pages Found in Couch Are Franklin's Will: [National Desk]

Full text: In deciding a family dispute over her estate, a jury in Michigan ruled that a handwritten document found in a couch at Franklin's home after her death represented her last wishes.
More than four years of family conflict over the estate of Aretha Franklin ended Tuesday when a Michigan jury decided what her family could not -- which of two hand-scrawled wills represented the famed singer's true wishes for how to divide her estate.
After a two-day trial in a probate court in Pontiac, Mich., a six-person jury decided after less than an hour of deliberation that a four-page document written by Franklin in 2014 -- and discovered under a couch cushion at her home, months after Franklin's 2018 death -- should serve as her will.
The verdict resolved the biggest problem that had been hanging over Franklin's estate, and sets in motion a plan for how income and assets from her estate should be divided.
"We just want to exhale right now," Kecalf Franklin, one of the singer's four sons, said outside the courtroom. "It's been a long five years for my family and my children."
After the singer died, at age 76, her family believed she had no will. Under Michigan law, her assets would have been divided equally among her four sons: Kecalf, Edward and Clarence Franklin, and Ted White Jr. The sons unanimously selected a cousin as the estate's personal representative, a position similar to that of an executor.
But months later, in May 2019, the two handwritten documents were found at Franklin's home in suburban Detroit -- one in a locked cabinet, the other in a spiral notebook in the couch -- which immediately divided the singer's children. It also raised questions about how music royalties and other income from the estate -- as well as cherished items like Franklin's furs, jewelry and musical instruments -- would be distributed.
Neither document was prepared by a lawyer, and neither lists witnesses, though the first one was notarized. Both had detailed lists of assets, along with what seemed to be extraneous information, like dismissive comments about some of the men in Franklin's life.
In the absence of a traditionally executed will, the jury was left to decide whether the 2014 document met with the standards of Michigan law, which allow for "holographic," or handwritten, wills.
The wills also divided Franklin's assets differently. The earlier one specified weekly and monthly allowances to each of Franklin's four sons. It also stipulated that Kecalf and Edward "must take business classes and get a certificate or a degree" to collect from the estate.
In the later will, three of Franklin's sons -- all except Clarence -- would receive equal shares of their mother's music royalties, but Kecalf and his children would receive more of Franklin's personal property. According to the document, Kecalf would receive his mother's primary home in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. -- valued at $ 1.1 million at the time of her death -- as well as the singer's cars. According to an accounting submitted to court in March, Franklin owned a Mercedes-Benz, two Cadillacs and a Thunderbird convertible.
Kecalf and Edward favored this later document, saying that it represented her final wishes and revoked the earlier one. White, who long played guitar in his mother's band, argued for the 2010 will; at about a dozen pages, that document is much more detailed, and has Franklin's signature on every page.
"Yes, there's nothing that says you can't keep a will in a spiral notebook in your couch cushion," Kurt A. Olson, a lawyer for White, said in his opening statement. "The bigger issue here is, What was her intent?"
According to Craig A. Smith, a lawyer for Edward Franklin, the sons have agreed to all support Clarence, the singer's first child, who according to court papers has a mental illness.
The judge overseeing the case, Jennifer S. Callaghan, said that even though the 2014 will has been found valid by the jury, White can still make arguments that some aspects of the earlier document could be incorporated into the estate plan.
As the probate case made its way through court over the years, it became combative. Kecalf accused Sabrina Owens, the cousin initially elected to run the estate, of mismanagement. She resigned from the position in 2020, citing the "rift" that had developed in the family.
In the small courtroom this week, there was still a palpable coldness among Kecalf, Edward and Ted White Jr. No handshakes, no small talk and no eye contact were shared between the trio of adult men, who sat shoulder-to-shoulder on a bench behind their respective lawyers.
White held his wife's hand throughout the trial. He said the brothers are stiff to each other in court but still talk otherwise.
"We're as close as three old men can be," White told a reporter inside the courtroom on Monday.
After the trial concluded, Kecalf denied there was any bad blood between him and White. "I love my brother with all my heart," he said.
There was no dispute that Franklin had written the documents, though there has been a debate as to whether the 2014 will was properly signed -- a smiley face appears to take the place of her first initial.
"Why would anyone sign a document if it was just a draft?" Charles L. McKelvie, a lawyer for Kecalf, asked in court.
After Franklin died, her estate was valued at $ 18 million, according to Smith. In 2021, the estate reached a deal with the Internal Revenue Service to pay off about $ 8 million in federal income taxes; under that agreement, the estate said it would set aside 40 percent of revenues -- including from music royalties and licensing, as well as income from projects like "Respect," the 2021 biopic starring Jennifer Hudson -- to pay federal taxes owed by the estate, as well as estimated taxes owed by heirs.
The court accounting document this year lists $ 4.1 million in personal property and real estate, including several homes in Michigan; $ 42,000 in furs; $ 73,000 in jewelry; companies and accounts related to Franklin's music; and a little over $ 1 million in bank balances. The accounting did not attempt to estimate future earnings from her estate's licensing rights.

How Tom Brady’s Crypto Ambitions Collided With Reality

SAN FRANCISCO — As the FTX cryptocurrency exchange imploded last fall, Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, made an urgent phone call.
He dialed Sina Nader, FTX’s head of partnerships. The exchange’s staff was in the middle of a crisis meeting with its beleaguered founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Nader couldn’t answer. “I never would’ve expected to decline a call from Tom Brady,” he said.
Brady had reasons to be concerned. As an “ambassador” for FTX, he had appeared at the company’s conference in the Bahamas and in TV commercials that promoted the exchange as “the most trusted” institution in the loosely regulated world of crypto.
His money was also at stake. As part of an endorsement agreement Brady signed in 2021, FTX had paid him $30 million, a deal that consisted almost entirely of FTX stock, three people with knowledge of the contract said. Brady’s wife at the time, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, was paid $18 million in FTX stock, one of the people said.
Now FTX is bankrupt, and Bankman-Fried is facing criminal fraud charges. Brady, 45, and Bündchen, 42, have been sued by a group of FTX customers seeking compensation from the celebrities who endorsed the exchange. On top of it all, the terms of the deal would have required the former couple, who divorced last year, to pay taxes on at least some of their now worthless FTX stock, two people familiar with the endorsement deal said.
Their situation is the highest-profile example of a humiliating reckoning facing the actors, athletes and other celebrities who rushed to embrace the easy money and online hype of cryptocurrencies. During the boom times, Paris Hilton, Snoop Dogg, Reese Witherspoon and Matt Damon all gushed about or invested in crypto projects, bringing a mainstream audience to the wonky world of digital currencies. It was fun — and lucrative — while prices soared.
But last year’s crash ended the celebrity crypto bonanza.
In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered Kim Kardashian to pay $1.26 million for failing to make adequate disclosures when she endorsed the EthereumMax crypto token. In December, a lawyer in California sued two crypto companies, MoonPay and Yuga Labs, accusing them of using a “vast network of A-list musicians, athletes and celebrity clients” to mislead investors about digital assets.
In March, the SEC charged actress Lindsay Lohan, online influencer Jake Paul, and musicians including Soulja Boy and Lil Yachty with illegally promoting crypto assets. And in late May, after months of failed attempts, a process server delivered court papers to Shaquille O’Neal, the retired basketball star, who was sued for promoting FTX, according to legal filings. O’Neal was served while broadcasting from a National Basketball Association playoff game.
Representatives for Brady, Bankman-Fried and MoonPay declined to comment. A spokesperson for Yuga Labs said the company had “never paid a celebrity to join the club.” Representatives for Bündchen and O’Neal did not respond to requests for comment.
Tech startups and celebrities have long had a symbiotic relationship. The startups offer stars a way to make money while staying on the cutting edge of internet culture; the celebrities help young companies gain credibility and reach a larger audience.
Of all the startups that recruited celebrities to endorse crypto, FTX was perhaps the most eager. As Bankman-Fried tried to turn FTX into a household name, he made a list of celebrities he could envision promoting the company, recalled Nader, the former FTX executive. Brady’s name was at the top.
A former college football player, Nader was in charge of recruiting Brady and other stars. In June 2021, Brady and Bündchen agreed to a deal with Bankman-Fried, praising the “revolutionary FTX team.” Brady seemed genuinely interested in crypto, Nader said, and occasionally had conversations with Bankman-Fried.
“Imagine a tiger and a lion talking,” Nader said. “They’re slightly different, they do different things, but they’re really formidable in their own arenas.”
In 2021, Brady also co-founded Autograph, which helps famous people sell the crypto collectibles known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Autograph raised more than $200 million from investors, and Bankman-Fried joined the board.
That same year, Brady and Bündchen starred in a $20 million advertising campaign for FTX, with commercials that ran during NFL games. Brady also posted TikTok videos with Bankman-Fried from FTX’s headquarters in the Bahamas, where he spoke at a conference in front of hundreds. Backstage, Bankman-Fried remarked that he could imagine buying a football team someday with Brady. Bündchen also appeared at the conference as FTX’s head of environmental and social initiatives.
When FTX collapsed in November, the company’s $32 billion valuation — including Brady and Bündchen’s $48 million in shares — plummeted to zero. The couple had also received a small amount of ethereum, bitcoin and solana tokens to trade on the platform, one of the people said, which disappeared in FTX’s bankruptcy.
Brady has not commented publicly on FTX or his relationship with Bankman-Fried. After FTX’s crisis meeting in November, Nader called him back.
“He was concerned,” Nader said. “The very first thing he asked me was: ‘Sina, how are you doing? I know you put your heart and soul into this.’”
Bündchen said in a March interview with Vanity Fair that she had “trusted the hype” and felt “blindsided.”
Brady’s other crypto venture has also struggled. Autograph’s revenue sank last year amid the crypto meltdown, a person familiar with its finances said. The startup has shifted its strategy to focus more on helping celebrities find ways to foster loyalty with their fans, and less on marketing crypto tokens to consumers, the person said. The firm has also removed some crypto language from its marketing, downplaying terms like NFT, another person with knowledge of the company said.
Autograph has also cut more than 50 employees in layoff rounds, a third person said. The reductions were reported earlier by Insider. An Autograph spokesperson declined to comment.
Brady has also faced legal trouble. In December, Adam Moskowitz and the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner filed a lawsuit in federal court in Florida accusing him and Bündchen of misleading investors. Among the other defendants are comedian Larry David, NBA star Steph Curry and tennis player Naomi Osaka, all of whom endorsed FTX.
“None of these defendants performed any due diligence prior to marketing these FTX products to the public,” the lawsuit said.
Some celebrities narrowly escaped the crypto mess. Katy Perry, the pop star, held talks about a partnership with FTX that never came to fruition, three people familiar with the situation have said.
In spring last year, Taylor Swift discussed a deal with FTX that could have paid as much as $100 million, two people familiar with the matter said. A tour sponsorship was on the table after Swift declined other promotional options, a person with knowledge of the talks said. The deal’s size was reported earlier by The Financial Times.
Moskowitz, the lawyer suing the celebrities, said on a podcast in April that Swift had conducted due diligence on FTX, asking the exchange to prove that its cryptocurrencies were not unregistered securities. His comments led to a flurry of headlines about Swift’s business acumen. But in an interview with The New York Times, Moskowitz said he had no inside information about the talks.
In reality, Swift’s side signed the sponsorship agreement with FTX after more than six months of discussions, three people with knowledge of the deal said, and it was Bankman-Fried who pulled out. The last-minute reversal left Swift’s team frustrated and disappointed, two of the people said.
A spokesperson for Swift declined to comment.

Lithium Scarcity Has Carmakers Scrambling Into Mining Industry: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Eager to avoid falling further behind Tesla and Chinese car companies, many Western auto executives are bypassing traditional suppliers and committing billions of dollars on deals with lithium mining companies.
They are showing up in hard hats and steel-toed boots to scope out mines in places like Chile, Argentina, Quebec and Nevada to secure supplies of a metal that could make or break their companies as they move from gasoline to battery power.
Without lithium, U.S. and European carmakers won't be able to build batteries for the electric pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and sedans they need to remain competitive. And assembly lines they are ramping up in places like Michigan, Tennessee and Saxony, Germany, will grind to a halt.
Established mining companies don't have enough lithium to supply the industry as electric vehicle sales soar. General Motors plans for all its car sales to be electric by 2035. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of battery-powered cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles in the United States rose 45 percent from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book.
So car companies are scrambling to lock up exclusive access to smaller mines before others swoop in. But the strategy exposes them to the risky, boom-and-bust business of mining, sometimes in politically unstable countries with weak environmental protections. If they bet incorrectly, automakers could end up paying far more for lithium than it might sell for in a few years.
Auto executives said they had no choice because there weren't sufficient reliable supplies of lithium and other battery materials, like nickel and cobalt, for the millions of electric vehicles the world needs.
In the past, automakers let battery suppliers buy lithium and other raw material on their own. But lithium shortages have forced carmakers, which have deeper pockets, to directly acquire the essential metal and have it sent to battery factories, some owned by suppliers and others owned partly or fully by the automakers. Batteries rely on lightweight lithium ions to conduct energy.
"We quickly realized there wasn't an established value chain that would support our ambitions for the next 10 years," said Sham Kunjur, who oversees General Motors' program to secure battery materials.
The automaker last year struck a supply deal with Livent, a lithium company in Philadelphia, for material from South American mines. And in January, G.M. agreed to invest $ 650 million in Lithium Americas, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. The company beat out 50 bidders, including battery and component makers, for that stake, said Mr. Kunjur and Lithium Americas executives.
Ford Motor has made lithium deals with SQM, a Chilean supplier; Albemarle, based in Charlotte, N.C.; and Nemaska Lithium of Quebec.
"These are some of the largest lithium producers in the world with the best quality," Lisa Drake, vice president for electric vehicle industrialization at Ford, told investors in May.
The deals that automakers are striking with mining companies and raw material processors hark back to the beginnings of the industry, when Ford set up rubber plantations in Brazil to secure material for tires.
"It almost seems like 100 years later, with this new revolution, we are back to that stage," Mr. Kunjur said.
Establishing a supply chain for lithium will be expensive: $ 51 billion, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm. To benefit from U.S. subsidies, battery raw materials must be mined and processed in North America or by trade allies.
But intense competition for the metal has helped inflate lithium prices to unsustainable levels, some executives said.
"Since the start of '22 the price of lithium has gone up so quickly and there was so much hype in the system, there were a lot of really bad deals that one could do," said R.J. Scaringe, chief executive of Rivian, an electric vehicle company in Irvine, Calif.
Dozens of companies are developing mines, and there may eventually be more than enough lithium to meet everybody's needs. Global production could surge sooner than expected, leading to a collapse in the price of lithium, something that has happened in the recent past. That would leave automakers paying a lot more for the metal than it was worth.
Auto executives are taking no chances, fearing that if they go even a few years without sufficient lithium their companies will never catch up.
Their fears have merit. In places where electric vehicle sales have grown the fastest, established automakers have lost a lot of ground. In China, where almost one-third of new cars are electric, Volkswagen, G.M. and Ford have lost market share to domestic producers like BYD, which manufacturers its own batteries. And Tesla, which has built a supply chain for lithium and other raw materials over years, has steadily gained market share in China, Europe and the United States. It is now the second-largest seller of all new cars in California after Toyota.
Chinese companies often have an edge over U.S. and European car companies because they are state owned or state supported, and, as a result, can take more risks in mining, which often encounters local opposition, nationalization by populist governments or technical difficulties.
In June, the Chinese battery maker CATL completed an agreement with Bolivia to invest $ 1.4 billion in two lithium projects. Few Western companies have shown sustained interest in the country, known for its political instability.
With a few exceptions, Western carmakers have avoided buying stakes in lithium mines. Instead, they are negotiating agreements in which they promise to buy a certain amount of lithium within a price range.
Often the deals give carmakers preferential access, crowding out rivals. Tesla has a deal with Piedmont Lithium, which is near Charlotte, that ensures the carmaker a large portion of the output from a mine in Quebec.
Lithium is abundant but not always easy to extract.
Many countries with big reserves, like Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, have nationalized natural resources or have stringent currency exchange controls that can limit the ability of foreign investors to withdraw money from the country. Even in Canada and the United States, it can take years to establish mines.
"Lithium is going to be tough to get and to fully electrify here in the U.S.," said Eric Norris, president of the Lithium global business unit at Albemarle, the leading American lithium miner.
As a result, auto executives and consultants are fanning out to mines around the world, most of which have not begun producing.
"There's a bit of desperation,," said Amanda Hall, chief executive of Summit Nanotech, a Canadian start-up working on technology to hasten extraction of lithium from saline groundwater. Auto executives, she said, are "trying to get ahead of the problem."
Yet, in their hurry, car companies are making deals with small mines that may not live up to expectations. "There are a lot of examples of problems that come up," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. Lithium prices could eventually collapse from overproduction, she said.
The miners appear to be the big winners. Their deals with the car companies typically assure them fat profits and make it easier for them to borrow money or sell shares.
Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest mining companies, recently reached a preliminary agreement to supply lithium to Ford from a mine it was developing in Argentina.
Ford was one of several car companies that expressed interest, said Marnie Finlayson, managing director of Rio Tinto's battery minerals business. Rio Tinto takes car company representatives through a checklist, she said, that covers mining methods, relations with local communities and environmental impact "to get everyone comfortable."
"Because if we can't do that, then the supply is not going to be unlocked, and we're not going to solve this global challenge together," Ms. Finlayson said, referring to climate change.
Until a few years ago, the price of lithium was so low mining it was hardly profitable. But now with the growing popularity of electric vehicles, there are dozens of proposed mines. Most are in early development stages and will take years to begin production.
Until 2021, "there was either no capital or very short-term capital," said Ana Cabral-Gardner, co-chief executive of Sigma Lithium, a Vancouver-based company that is producing lithium in Brazil. "No one was looking at a five-year horizon and a 10-year horizon."
Auto companies are playing an important role in helping mines get up and running, said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech Lithium, which is developing a mine in Ontario and a processing plant in eastern Germany that will supply Mercedes-Benz.
"I do not think that this is a risky strategy," Mr. Harbecke said. "I think it's a necessary strategy."

Tesla Sales Are Up 10% As Perks Fuel Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Incentives and price cuts made Tesla electric cars cheaper than comparable gasoline models. But the company faces growing competition in China, a key market.
Tesla sales rose a better-than-expected 10 percent in the second quarter as the company led by Elon Musk benefited from government incentives and price cuts that made its electric cars less expensive than comparable gasoline models.
Tesla delivered 466,000 vehicles from April through June, up from 423,000 vehicles in the previous quarter, the company said on Sunday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in the second quarter rose 83 percent as the company expanded production at new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin.
The sales figures exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts and showed that Tesla was able to overcome the effect of higher interest rates, which raise monthly payments for people who buy cars on credit.
Tesla was the first of the automakers to report its sales numbers. Sales of most major car brands probably rose sharply in the last quarter, analysts say. Supply chain issues have improved, making it easier for carmakers to get the components they need and for buyers to find the cars they want. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that U.S. new vehicle sales will rise more than 8 percent this year from 2022.
Rules that took effect this year allowed buyers of Tesla vehicles to qualify for $ 7,500 in federal tax credits. With the credit, the least expensive Model 3 sedan sells for less than $ 33,000, cheaper than similar luxury sedans sold by Mercedes-Benz and BMW that run on gasoline and in line with mass market cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
Owners of electric cars also benefit from fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. Electric vehicles don't require oil changes, and electricity is generally cheaper per mile than gasoline.
Tesla is the dominant maker of electric cars in the United States, with a market share of 62 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. But its share has slipped from more than 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 as established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen have begun offering more electric models.
In China, a bigger car market than the United States or Europe, Tesla faces intense competition from local manufacturers that have newer model lineups, like BYD. On average, electric vehicles by Chinese manufacturers have been in showrooms a bit more than a year, according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm. Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, went on sale in 2020.
Chinese manufacturers also offer interior and exterior styling and entertainment and information systems that better cater to local tastes, AlixPartners noted, citing consumer surveys.
While Tesla sales have continued to climb, the company's profitability has suffered because it has had to cut prices to prop up demand. Tesla made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, down from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of 2022.
Many investors are betting that Tesla's growth will accelerate as demand for electric vehicles grows, and the company begins selling the Cybertruck, an electric pickup truck, later this year. Tesla's agreement to let other carmakers, including Ford and G.M., use its charging network could also become a new source of revenue.
Tesla's share price has more than doubled this year although it remains well below its peak in 2021, when the company was worth more than $ 1 trillion.
The carmaker said on Sunday that it would publish its financial results for this year's second quarter on July 19.

Full text: The News
Volkswagen is replacing the chief executive at its luxury brand Audi, naming Gernot Döllner to take over from Markus Duesmann, as the company seeks to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles.
Mr. Döllner, who has served as Volkswagen's leading strategist, will start his new role on Sept. 1, Audi said in a statement on Thursday. Audi, although profitable, is struggling to convert to battery power and compete with the growing threat from Chinese carmakers.
Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's chief executive before Oliver Blume took over in September, brought Mr. Duesmann to Audi from BMW three years ago, with the hope that he could help the brand innovate and strengthen sales of its electric models.
The company's earnings grew 40 percent to 7.6 billion euros, or $ 8.3 billion, in 2022, thanks to a decision to prioritize its higher-end vehicles over more affordable cars as it worked through a chips shortage caused by the supply chain disruptions linked to the coronavirus pandemic.
Audi is now working on its final generation of combustion engine models and plans to bring 10 new electric models to its lineup, ahead of plans to produce only E.V.s beginning in 2026.
What It Means: Audi faces competition for electric vehicles.
Audi is Volkswagen's second-most-important luxury line, after Porsche. Although Porsche has successfully broken into the market for electric vehicles, Audi's strength has been the continued popularity of its combustion engine vehicles.
Now, the company faces stiff competition from the leading producers of electric vehicles, such as Tesla and Chinese automakers. Mr. Blume has said he expects the company to maintain 14 percent growth and wants to see Audi better coordinate its production with both VW and Porsche.
That will be easier with Mr. Döllner as the company's head, as he worked many years alongside Mr. Blume when both were top-level managers at Porsche, which like Audi is owned by the Volkswagen Group.
Mr. Döllner has been working at Volkswagen since 1993, while still earning his doctorate. He served as head of Porsche's four-door Panamera sedan series, which he helped develop.
What's Next: A focus on North America and China.
A main focus for Mr. Döllner will be to push ahead talks on opening a factory in North America. Audi's main competitors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, both have production facilities in the United States, allowing them to produce nearly twice as many vehicles for that market. Audi's S.U.V.s are popular with U.S. drivers, and the company is looking at developing electric versions of several of its leading models.
In China, Audi's combustion engine vehicles remain popular, but the company needs to speed up production of electric vehicles if the brand is to remain competitive with popular local producers, including BYD and Chery.

French Police Kill Teen Driver During Traffic Stop, Igniting Protests: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The shooting of a teenage driver in a suburb of Paris fed into longstanding complaints about the French police. Protesters burned cars and clashed with riot officers.
In a working class Paris suburb, two police officers confront a 17-year-old driver in a canary yellow Mercedes who was stopped in traffic. They shout at him, video footage shows, and one officer appears to have his gun drawn. The teenager is then fatally shot in broad daylight.
The shooting -- and the diverging accounts of what caused it -- led to spasms of violence on the streets and criticism of the officers by French officials normally loath to utter the words "police violence."
The initial accounts of the events on Tuesday, provided to the French news media by anonymous police sources, claimed the driver had plowed into the officers, leading one to shoot. Then a video surfaced on Twitter.
That footage, believed to have been captured by a witness, showed the car was stopped as an officer on the driver's side pointed a gun into the vehicle. When the car started to pull away, a blast was heard, and the car hurtled off, crashing into a nearby sidewalk.
The teenage driver died an hour later.
The shooting fed into longstanding complaints about the French police, who have faced accusations of brutality, especially in Paris's poorer suburbs, which are often home to people from immigrant backgrounds.
As the video spread, President Emmanuel Macron called the shooting "inexcusable." Lawmakers held a moment of silence for the teenager, whose name was given only as Nahel M.
Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, while taking pains to note the commitment of officers and gendarmes "who are in the field every day," offered stark criticism, saying the footage showed an operation "that clearly does not appear to comply with the rules of engagement of our police forces."
Even Gérald Darmanin, Mr. Macron's tough-talking interior minister and a frequent defender of the police, was unusually critical, saying, "An act like the one that we saw, if the investigation confirms the videos that we have seen, is never justified."
Local prosecutors in Nanterre, the western suburb of Paris where the shooting occurred, have opened a manslaughter investigation. The officer accused of shooting the teenager has not been publicly identified and has not been charged, but was in custody for questioning.
Alliance Police Nationale, a police union, reacted angrily to Mr. Macron's comments and said in a statement that police officers, "like any citizen, have the right to the presumption of innocence," and that it was "inconceivable" for Mr. Macron or other officials to "condemn our colleagues" before the end of the investigation.
So far, no official has disputed the content of the unconfirmed video, which spread widely on social media. The woman who said she had posted the original video on Twitter told The New York Times that it had been given to her by the witness, with whom she is close. The woman asked that her name be withheld to avoid repercussions for sharing the footage.
After unrest erupted overnight Tuesday, Mr. Darmanin said that 2,000 police officers and gendarmes would be deployed across the Paris region on Wednesday evening to contain any more violence. As night fell, sporadic clashes erupted once again in several French cities, including Toulouse and Lille. In Nanterre, protesters set cars on fire and set off fireworks; in Viry-Châtillon, south of Paris, a group of young people set a bus on fire, but no injuries were reported.
During earlier violence, rioters threw rocks and fireworks at riot police, who responded with tear gas. Protesters burned about 40 cars. A City Hall annex in Mantes-la-Jolie, a town west of Paris, was destroyed. And more than 30 people were arrested, according to the French authorities.
Sofia Berkoukeche, 29, an occupational psychologist who has lived in Nanterre for nearly a decade, said on Wednesday that there was "a general frustration with police violence" and called the shooting "the last straw."
"You can't take such radical measures to impose order," said Ms. Berkoukeche, who was working on the terrace of a cafe in the suburb. "It makes the police less credible."
The shooting inflamed long-simmering anger in suburbs where relations between the police and residents are often freighted with mistrust. In one of the most infamous episodes in the Paris suburbs, two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré, running from the police were electrocuted in 2005 after they hid in an electrical substation, provoking weeks of violent protests across the country.
It also revived debate about the French police's use of deadly force, with some left-wing lawmakers saying it was yet more evidence that a 2017 law making it easier for officers to shoot at moving vehicles should be repealed, or at least revised.
The law says officers can shoot if they deem the moving vehicle dangerous to their lives or to those of others. It was passed after several police unions argued that it was needed to better protect officers. Critics have said that it is too vague and might lead to unnecessary deaths. While acknowledging that police shootings at moving vehicles have increased since the law passed, the French authorities have said that the rise is mostly because more drivers are refusing to stop.
Laurent Nuñez, the Paris police prefect, told the French TV channel CNews that the two officers had tried to stop the car on Tuesday because the driver had committed several traffic violations and had not complied with orders to stop, before getting stuck in traffic.
"Why is it that, in our republic, a failure to comply can be punishable by a bullet in the chest or head?" Sabrina Sebaihi, a lawmaker representing the district where the teenager was killed, said in Parliament on Tuesday.
Mr. Darmanin said the officer involved in the shooting would be punished if warranted. Both officers, who are in their late 30s and early 40s, are experienced members of the traffic police and have no record of misconduct, Mr. Darmanin added.
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre said that the shooting had occurred near Place Nelson Mandela, a square not far from La Défense, a business district northwest of Paris. Two people were in the vehicle, a Mercedes-AMG, in addition to the driver, the office said: One was released after questioning; the other was still being sought after fleeing the scene.
Yassine Bouzrou, a lawyer for Nahel M.'s relatives, said that they were planning to file a complaint accusing the officer of murder. The family would also file suit accusing the other officer of complicity, the lawyer said.
Assa Traoré, an activist whose half brother, Adama Traoré, died of asphyxiation while in custody in 2016 after fleeing a police identification check, said that the video from Tuesday had been key in quickly spurring widespread protests. Many similar encounters are not caught on camera, she noted.
"He is a symbol of all the other ones that we don't see," Ms. Traoré said of Nahel M.
Nanterre, with a population of nearly 100,000, is home to one of the Paris region's largest universities. It is a more working-class area than neighboring cities, though not nearly as impoverished as some of the other suburbs that ring Paris.
Patrick Jarry, the mayor of Nanterre, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the suburb had experienced "one of the worst days of its history."
"Let us stop this destructive spiral," Mr. Jarry said. "We want justice for Nahel; we will obtain it through peaceful mobilization."
A march in the teenager's name is scheduled for Thursday.
Residents of Nanterre said they were both shocked and unsurprised by the shooting.
Mathilde Emery, a 17-year-old high school student who was on a park bench, said she had known Nahel and described him as an easygoing classmate who liked to joke around.
"We already have a bad perception of the police," she said. "It's just disappointing."
Actors, artists and athletes also noted the shooting with sadness.
The actor Omar Sy and the soccer player Kylian Mbappé both expressed support for Nahel M.'s family on social media.
Writing on Twitter, Mr. Mbappé said, "My France hurts."

There's No Journey Too Far for Midcentury Furniture: [Style Desk]

Full text: The credenza in the back of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van groaned as Lars Balderskilde drove through the woodlands near Vejle, a city on a fjord about two and a half hours from Copenhagen.
It was late January, and after passing a lake filled with swans, Mr. Balderskilde stopped at a house where he picked up an old bar cabinet that he paid for in cash. Then came stops at other homes to collect nesting tables and a mirror. The sun had set by the time he met Nina Toft and Grethe Kock, two sisters, at the home of their mother, whose funeral they had hosted earlier that day.
"It's always emotional, but you have to let go," Ms. Toft said to Mr. Balderskilde, who had come to look at various pieces in the house.
Ms. Kock showed him a tiny clay bird that she had made as a girl. "I'll give you a good deal," she said, jokingly.
Mr. Balderskilde did not take the bird. But he did fill the van with a teak dresser and bookcase the sisters' parents had owned since the 1950s, a desk, a blue PH 5 pendant lamp and a Le Klint 325 floor lamp, a model originally designed to decorate a residence of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr. He paid the sisters $ 1,800 for the items.
Ms. Toft and Ms. Kock had contacted Mr. Balderskilde through a website where he offers to buy furniture from people all over Denmark. While lugging the pieces out of the house, Mr. Balderskilde told Ms. Toft, "I have a boutique in New York."
The store, Lanoba, is actually in Jersey City, N.J., and sells refurbished Danish modern furniture, a minimalist style originating in Denmark that was typically made with natural materials like wood, leather and Danish cord from the 1930s through the 1960s.
Mr. Balderskilde, 47, who is Danish, and his husband, David Singh, 48, started the business in late 2015. Mr. Balderskilde said that he and his husband, who liked going to estate sales, had noticed a growing demand for midcentury modern furniture, particularly in the wake of "Mad Men," the highly stylized TV show set mostly in the 1960s, whose final season was broadcast in the spring of 2015.
In and Out of Style
Danish modern design was influenced by the work of Kaare Klint, an architect, furniture designer and academic known for measuring "paper, books, tableware and humans to find the optimal proportions for furniture," said Christian Holmsted Olesen, the head of exhibitions and collections at the Design Museum Danmark in Copenhagen. (Mr. Klint's brother, Tage Klint, founded the brand Le Klint in 1943.)
By the 1960s, the furniture had become associated with the broader midcentury modern style popularized by American designers like Charles and Ray Eames, who often mixed wood and leather with materials like metal and plastic. Among the most notable Danish modern pieces of that decade were a pair of teak and leather chairs by Hans Wegner, which were used in a televised 1960 presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.
The chairs, Mr. Balderskilde said jokingly, "almost took focus away from the debate."
In the 1970s, as decorating tastes shifted toward what he described as "plastic fantastic," Danish modern furniture became less desirable. In Denmark, some pieces were tossed to the curb, according to Mr. Balderskilde, who said that a lot of furniture produced in the style's heyday no longer exists.
"Nobody -- nobody -- wanted this stuff," Mr. Balderskilde added.
By the time Mr. Balderskilde and Mr. Singh had started Lanoba, demand had risen for furniture by leading Danish modern designers like Mr. Wegner, Finn Juhl and Grethe Jalk. (Mr. Balderskilde said that few retailers in the United States were offering pieces by "middle market" designers like Johannes Andersen and Omann Jun.) He saw potential in a business that brought unwanted pieces from Danish homes to American buyers, even if he had to travel around Denmark to buy items from individual sellers.
Amassing an inventory, he said, at first required the type of canvassing done by fledgling political campaigns. "I chatted up a lot of people in the grocery," Mr. Balderskilde said. "I knocked on so many doors."
From One Home to Another
Lanoba's first sale was a footstool to a psychologist in Manhattan, which Mr. Balderskilde delivered to the buyer's office. The business has since imported thousands of pieces, he said; most of the buyers live in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.
Mr. Balderskilde now has a network of people in Denmark who know what he is looking for and who help spread the word, and he also finds pieces on platforms like Facebook Marketplace and DBA, a Danish secondhand exchange. He takes three or four sourcing trips a year (Mr. Singh stays behind to run the store), on which he tries to collect as many as 500 items.
Before the pieces are sent from Denmark to New York in shipping containers, they are stored in a barn owned by Mr. Balderskilde's older brother, a cabinetmaker who taught him how to restore furniture.
The markup on items sold at Lanoba varies -- some pieces cost hundreds of dollars, others thousands -- and is determined in part by the shipping costs to the United States, Mr. Balderskilde said. Sellers in Denmark, he said, generally know the provenance of the furniture he buys from them.
"It's not like 'American Pickers,"' Mr. Balderskilde said, referring to the reality show about antiques sellers buying unwanted items from people who are often unaware of the items' potential value. "People know what they have."
When many offices closed during the pandemic, Mr. Balderskilde said, Lanoba was flooded with requests for desks. He could not travel to Denmark at the time, so he asked friends and family there to find pieces for him. At one point, the store received a shipment of about 250 desks. "They sold out in five weeks," Mr. Balderskilde said.
A lot of buyers appreciate that the furniture comes from "real Danish homes," he said, and many sellers in Denmark like what he called the "saga" of Grandma's furniture making its way to a brownstone in Brooklyn.
The day after Mr. Balderskilde had bought pieces from the sisters, he drove to a house in Brylle, a village on the Danish island of Funen, passing a wooden windmill, a metal windmill and an abandoned mink farm along the way.
The home, which had a for-sale sign on its lawn, belonged to the parents of Lars Egedal. Mr. Egedal was meeting Mr. Balderskilde to show him a desk that Mr. Egedal's parents had received as a wedding gift from his grandparents in the 1960s.
Mr. Egedal said that his grandmother wasn't happy when his parents used the desk, which had a built-in bookshelf, to decorate his brother's childhood bedroom. "But I think she would have approved of it going to New York," he said.

Full text: True believers in the immersive audio format say it could restore a musical appreciation lost to a generation that has come up during the streaming era.
After more than 30 years as a producer and engineer, Brad Wood wasn't sure if he still had a future in music.
Wood, a classically trained saxophonist, had gotten his start in Chicago's early '90s music scene, helming breakthrough albums for Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, and platinum records for Smashing Pumpkins and Placebo. In 2000, he moved to Southern California, where he thrived for a time -- and then merely survived, as the downloading era sank recording budgets just as the brand of guitar rock he specialized in lost cultural relevancy.
While many of his colleagues gave up, Wood kept going, working harder while earning less. "I probably got to the point where I was making the same rate as when I started," he said.
Then, in 2021, an emergent technology ushered Wood -- and thousands of recording professionals like him -- into an unexpected boom time.
Over the past two years, Wood has been busy mixing old and new records in Dolby Atmos, an audio format that lets engineers create a listening experience more immersive than traditional stereo by placing sounds around and above the listener. Working for a variety of labels, Wood has done Atmos mixes for the Supremes, the Pogues, Jennifer Lopez, Modest Mouse, Gwen Stefani and Soul Asylum -- some 300-plus tracks in total, the equivalent of two dozen albums.
"The whole thing has been pretty unexpected and thrilling," he said.
For Dolby, the audio company that developed Atmos, and Apple Music -- which has invested heavily in it -- the technology could lead to the most dramatic shift in audio in 65 years.
"The recording industry went from mono to stereo decades ago, and it didn't move from there," John Couling, senior vice president of Dolby Laboratories, said in a phone interview.
There have been efforts to convince the public to adopt new advanced technologies in the years since, ‌including Quadraphonic sound in the '70s ‌and 5.1 surround sound in the '90s, but with little success. "We've changed formats, we've changed delivery methods, we've changed all sorts of things," Couling said, "but it was still fundamentally the same sound. Atmos is a completely new experience."
Oliver Schusser, a vice president at Apple Music, said that his company, which has incentivized record labels to deliver catalog material in Atmos, sees it as a way to bring sonic value back to music -- something that's been lost among a whole generation that has come up during the streaming era.
"There was no appreciation of the art and work of sound engineers and mixing and mastering," Schusser said over a video call this spring. "That really pained us. We wanted to fix that."
Today, all three major record labels and hundreds of independents are delivering tracks in Atmos. Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal and QQ Music are among the 15 streaming services bringing Atmos to 160 countries and over 500 million listeners.
"But mention the word 'Atmos' to anyone in the general public and they don't know what the hell you're talking about," said the veteran engineer and producer Bob Clearmountain. One of the most respected and influential figures in the recording world, Clearmountain was initially dubious of Atmos's staying power, but he has come to believe in its future.
"Music has become background noise for most people. It's something in your headphones while you're out doing other stuff," he said during a call last month. "When I was a teenager, I used to listen to an album three, four times through just sitting in front of my speakers, entranced." That way of listening has disappeared, he said, but he's hopeful that Atmos can bring it back, "if we're able to get people to understand what it is and hear it the right way."
From the outside, it appears Atmos is entering a critical period that could determine whether it will kick off a sonic revolution or become just another tech lost to time.
DOLBY ATMOS, INTRODUCED in 2012, was initially developed for movie theaters and the home theater market. Because it offers a wider palette than stereo, and differs from traditional 5.1 and 7.1 channel setups, Atmos allows engineers -- typically mixing across a dozen or more speakers -- to put sound sources in front, to the side, behind and even above the listener.
"When you take sounds and you separate them from each other," Couling said, "you will be able to hear those sounds independently much more clearly than if they are on top of each other. By creating space, we also create depth and clarity -- and we found that's what content creators really wanted."
For artists like Chic's founder, Nile Rodgers, immersive audio is the closest thing to the musician's experience. "When I'm making a record, I'm sitting in a room with the band," Rodgers said during a video chat, "we're playing and jamming and what happens is the sound is bathing us. That's what music sounds like to me."
Listening to Dolby Atmos mixes in a professional recording studio can be a powerful experience. "It's remarkably seductive," said Clearmountain, who's done Atmos projects for Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and others. "I've played Atmos tracks for so many people who say, 'I can never listen to stereo again.' People have been in tears, moved by what they were hearing. It has an incredible effect."
Opinions among recording professionals on any subject are rarely uniform, and there are some who have reservations about Atmos.
Susan Rogers, a longtime engineer for Prince, left the music industry in the late '90s to become a cognitive neuroscientist. Last fall, Dolby invited her to the company headquarters in San Francisco to listen to a new Atmos mix of Prince's "When Doves Cry," a track she originally worked on.
"As both an engineer and as a psychoacoustician, I have mixed feelings about whether it's an improvement," Rogers said in a phone interview.
She noted that there are evolutionary and biological reasons that sound sources coming from behind and above listeners can be unsettling or anxiety inducing. She also observed that music is a potent form of communication in large part because the consummatory phase happens entirely in the listener's head. Having clearer and more sound sources can actually make it harder to know what to pay attention to.
"That was what I noticed listening to 'When Doves Cry' in Atmos," Rogers said. "It sounded amazing, but it was more difficult to assemble it into a unified whole in that private place I listen to music. I found it distracting." Her "knee-jerk reaction was 'do not want,"' she said. "But over time I may learn to like it."
APPLE MUSIC IS betting heavily that the public will, by and large, come to love Atmos. Although other companies, including Amazon, had flirted with the technology, in 2021 Apple decided to commit itself fully to Atmos, putting its own proprietary and branding spin on the tech, dubbing it "spatial" audio.
Strategically, Atmos offers Apple Music a way to further distinguish itself from streaming competitors like Spotify -- which has historically ignored high resolution or advanced audio options -- and siphon market share from the industry's dominant music service, YouTube.
"We wanted something where people would notice a difference immediately," said Schusser, the Apple Music executive. "Maybe not 100 percent would love Atmos or spatial audio right away, but everyone would know this sounds different, and the hope is the majority would come to appreciate the upgrade."
Initially, Apple's biggest challenge was that there was very little Atmos content available. In 2017, R.E.M.'s "Automatic for the People" became the first album mixed for Atmos, and over the next few years, several notable Atmos releases -- from Elton John, Queen and the Beatles -- showcased the format's possibilities.
To achieve its broader aims, Apple needed to make Atmos content both viable and plentiful. It began by partnering with Dolby to encourage recording studios to upgrade to the format. There are now some 800 officially recognized Dolby Atmos studios in over 40 countries, a 350 percent increase in just two years. (Dolby estimates there are two or three times that number of other studios capable of delivering music in Atmos.)
Apple Music also drew up wish lists of artists, albums and tracks and presented them to record labels, along with funding and deadlines, to help quickly expand the library of titles available in Atmos. Over the past few years, this effort to refit 50 years of pop music has heralded a rush of work for engineers and mixers, who've suddenly found themselves doing volume business in the format.
Wood, initially dismissive of learning to work in Atmos, said he changed his mind once he realized the inevitability of its rise. "It was clear that records I'd made were going to get mixed in Atmos," he said, "and if I didn't learn how to do it, somebody else would, and I'd be ceding that control." Wood's first Atmos mix was for Liz Phair's "Soberish," an album he'd originally produced. "And, also, I realized there would be a good payday in learning," he added.
While contemporary pop and hip-hop artists were quick to adopt the format for new releases, convincing veteran rock acts to enter the Atmos fray proved more of a challenge. "The first six months, those artists had a lot of questions," Schusser said.
Some groups, like the Doors, embraced the format, overhauling their entire catalog in Atmos all at once; others, like Fleetwood Mac, have proceeded more cautiously, doing one album at a time. More and more though, top legacy artists have been putting out Atmos mixes with increasing regularity, with recent releases including landmark albums like Pink Floyd's‌ ‌"The Dark Side of the Moon‌‌" and ‌the Beach Boys'‌ ‌"Pet Sounds."
Given the sheer volume of Atmos catalog work and the still evolving understanding of the format, not all mixes are created equal.
"The labels seem to be farming this stuff out and it isn't always being done with the original artist or production team involved," Clearmountain said. "I know that's not always possible. But sometimes what comes back are just bad mixes -- or strange mixes, anyway."
Wood -- who has done mixes in consultation with the original artists as well as on his own -- agrees. "In general, you have to try to put the tracks into a speaker array so it doesn't sound too jarring or gimmicky," he said. "The goal is to feel like you're sitting amongst these musicians as they're performing. Like all mixing, it's subjective, and how you approach it really depends on the music itself."
For some artists, transforming old recordings into Atmos has been challenging. Chic recently had its first three albums mixed in the format. "The process took months and months to get right," Rodgers said. "The team that was working on it, we gave them notes, we went into different rooms, did rough mixes to show them what we were talking about."
For others, the overhaul has been relatively painless and even eye-opening. This past spring, Alicia Keys had eight of her albums mixed for Atmos. In a video interview promoting her catalog overhaul, Keys said that engineers working on her albums "completely reimagined every note, every sound, every instrument, every voice. It sounds like you've never heard it before. I mean, I never even heard it like this before. It really is a new experience."
ONE OF THE reasons other highly touted surround sound technologies like 5.1 and 7.1 failed to catch on is because they required a specific speaker configuration. Dolby Atmos, however, is scalable and can adapt to a variety of setups.
Given its success in the headphones market, Apple has emphasized playback on its AirPods and Beats Fit Pro devices, which all offer a version of the Atmos experience with dynamic head tracking (where the sound shifts along with a user's movement) in the $ 200 to $ 500 range. A number of other manufacturers, including Audeze, RIG, Corsair and LG, also offer Atmos headphones and earbuds.
The options for affordable home music systems, ones purpose-built for Atmos audio, have been limited. Amazon and Apple have long offered their own Atmos-enabled smart speakers, but neither really conveyed the full range of sound possible.
In March, Sonos introduced a first of its kind sub- $ 500 speaker, the Era 300, which more successfully packages the Atmos experience into a single compact unit, equipped with a half-dozen drivers that direct sound left, right, forward and upward.
The Grammy-winning mixing and mastering engineer Emily Lazar, who helped test and fine tune the Era 300, hopes it will be the start of tech companies bringing more viable Atmos options to market.
"No one who's listened to Atmos in a properly tuned, beautiful-sounding studio can deny what it offers," she said. "How now can we deliver that in a smaller package so everybody can afford it and have that same kind of experience is going to be key moving forward."
If Atmos does ever achieve critical mass, it might come through automobiles. Most cars come equipped standard with a dozen-plus speakers, making them a natural environment for immersive audio. So far, a handful of major automakers including Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have introduced plans to put Atmos in their vehicles. It's a market Dolby and Apple both say they are determined to expand further.
"But those kind of tech changes don't happen in a year or two -- and that's really what it's been so far," Schusser said. "There's obviously more work to be done. But we're all optimistic we'll get there with Atmos."
In the meantime, recording pros like Wood will keep working and mixing, hoping the Atmos bump will last a little while longer.
"I don't know that I could have written a better chapter for this phase of my career," he said. "If you told me three years ago, I was going to get paid my day rate to listen and work on some of the greatest recordings in history, I would've said, 'Sign me up -- that sounds amazing."'

After more than 30 years as a producer and engineer, Brad Wood wasn’t sure if he still had a future in music.
Wood, a classically trained saxophonist, had gotten his start in Chicago’s early ’90s music scene, helming breakthrough albums for Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, and platinum records for Smashing Pumpkins and Placebo. In 2000, he moved to Southern California, where he thrived for a time — and then merely survived, as the downloading era sank recording budgets just as the brand of guitar rock he specialized in lost cultural relevancy.
While many of his colleagues gave up, Wood kept going, working harder while earning less. “I probably got to the point where I was making the same rate as when I started,” he said.
Then, in 2021, an emergent technology ushered Wood — and thousands of recording professionals like him — into an unexpected boom time.
Over the past two years, Wood has been busy mixing old and new records in Dolby Atmos, an audio format that lets engineers create a listening experience more immersive than traditional stereo by placing sounds around and above the listener. Working for a variety of labels, Wood has done Atmos mixes for the Supremes, the Pogues, Jennifer Lopez, Modest Mouse, Gwen Stefani and Soul Asylum — some 300-plus tracks in total, the equivalent of two dozen albums.
“The whole thing has been pretty unexpected and thrilling,” he said.
For Dolby, the audio company that developed Atmos, and Apple Music — which has invested heavily in it — the technology could lead to the most dramatic shift in audio in 65 years.
“The recording industry went from mono to stereo decades ago, and it didn’t move from there,” John Couling, senior vice president of Dolby Laboratories, said in a phone interview.
There have been efforts to convince the public to adopt new advanced technologies in the years since, including Quadraphonic sound in the ’70s and 5.1 surround sound in the ’90s, but with little success. “We’ve changed formats, we’ve changed delivery methods, we’ve changed all sorts of things,” Couling said, “but it was still fundamentally the same sound. Atmos is a completely new experience.”
Oliver Schusser, a vice president at Apple Music, said his company, which has incentivized record labels to deliver catalog material in Atmos, sees it as a way to bring sonic value back to music — something that’s been lost among a whole generation that has come up during the streaming era.
“There was no appreciation of the art and work of sound engineers and mixing and mastering,” Schusser said over a video call this spring. “That really pained us. We wanted to fix that.”
Today, all three major record labels and hundreds of independents are delivering tracks in Atmos. Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal and QQ Music are among the 15 streaming services bringing Atmos to 160 countries and over 500 million listeners.
“But mention the word ‘Atmos’ to anyone in the general public and they don’t know what the hell you’re talking about,” said veteran engineer and producer Bob Clearmountain. One of the most respected and influential figures in the recording world, Clearmountain was initially dubious of Atmos’ staying power, but he has come to believe in its future.
“Music has become background noise for most people. It’s something in your headphones while you’re out doing other stuff,” he said during a call last month. “When I was a teenager, I used to listen to an album three, four times through just sitting in front of my speakers, entranced.” That way of listening has disappeared, he said, but he’s hopeful that Atmos can bring it back, “if we’re able to get people to understand what it is and hear it the right way.”
From the outside, it appears Atmos is entering a critical period that could determine whether it will kick off a sonic revolution or become just another tech lost to time.
DOLBY ATMOS, INTRODUCED in 2012, was initially developed for movie theaters and the home theater market. Because it offers a wider palette than stereo, and differs from traditional 5.1 and 7.1 channel setups, Atmos allows engineers — typically mixing across a dozen or more speakers — to put sound sources in front, to the side, behind and even above the listener.
“When you take sounds and you separate them from each other,” Couling said, “you will be able to hear those sounds independently much more clearly than if they are on top of each other. By creating space, we also create depth and clarity — and we found that’s what content creators really wanted.”
For artists like Chic’s founder, Nile Rodgers, immersive audio is the closest thing to the musician’s experience. “When I’m making a record, I’m sitting in a room with the band,” Rodgers said during a video chat, “we’re playing and jamming and what happens is the sound is bathing us. That’s what music sounds like to me.”
Listening to Dolby Atmos mixes in a professional recording studio can be a powerful experience. “It’s remarkably seductive,” said Clearmountain, who has done Atmos projects for Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and others. “I’ve played Atmos tracks for so many people who say, ‘I can never listen to stereo again.’ People have been in tears, moved by what they were hearing. It has an incredible effect.”
Opinions among recording professionals on any subject are rarely uniform, and there are some who have reservations about Atmos.
Susan Rogers, a longtime engineer for Prince, left the music industry in the late ’90s to become a cognitive neuroscientist. Last fall, Dolby invited her to the company headquarters in San Francisco to listen to a new Atmos mix of Prince’s “When Doves Cry,” a track she originally worked on.
“As both an engineer and as a psychoacoustician, I have mixed feelings about whether it’s an improvement,” Rogers said in a phone interview.
She noted that there are evolutionary and biological reasons that sound sources coming from behind and above listeners can be unsettling or anxiety inducing. She also observed that music is a potent form of communication in large part because the consummatory phase happens entirely in the listener’s head. Having clearer and more sound sources can actually make it harder to know what to pay attention to.
“That was what I noticed listening to ‘When Doves Cry’ in Atmos,” Rogers said. “It sounded amazing, but it was more difficult to assemble it into a unified whole in that private place I listen to music. I found it distracting.” Her “knee-jerk reaction was ‘do not want,’” she said. “But over time I may learn to like it.”
APPLE MUSIC IS betting heavily that the public will, by and large, come to love Atmos.

A Mogul's Pitch to Build A Casino in Manhattan: It's All About Location: [National Desk]

Full text: Larry Silverstein joins a crowded, well-financed field of developers competing for three casino licenses in the New York City region.
The scrum of millionaires and billionaires hustling for the right to build a casino in New York City now includes Larry Silverstein, the real estate magnate who redeveloped much of the World Trade Center site after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Mr. Silverstein, 92, has never owned or invested in a casino. But he controls a site at 11th Avenue and 41st Street, four blocks west of Times Square, that he says is perfect for one because it borders several neighborhoods but is central to none. For that reason, his team argues, the location is less likely than others to raise residents' hackles.
He has teamed up with Watche Manoukian, a businessman based in London who owns Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pa., that state's highest grossing venue.
In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Silverstein suggested his bid was largely selfless: New York State, he said, needs tax revenue to support the transit system on which New York City's economy depends. Casinos can provide it, and as a major landlord, he is invested in the city's future.
"We do see it as a genuine need that the community has, the city and Albany," Mr. Silverstein, the chairman of Silverstein Properties, said. "Will it be profitable? I presume so because generally, this has been the case with casinos at large."
It is a novel argument in a crowded, well-financed field of competitors with unique pitches (one proposal involves a roller coaster; another, a Ferris wheel). About 10 teams are expected to bid for one of up to three casino licenses in the region.
The field includes SL Green Realty Corporation, which calls itself the city's largest commercial landlord and wants to build a casino in Times Square with Caesars Entertainment; the Hudson Yards developer Related Companies and Wynn Resorts, which have proposed a casino on Manhattan's Far West Side; the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, who owns the New York Mets and has developed a bid with Hard Rock for a casino next to the team's Queens stadium; and Las Vegas Sands, which wants to put a casino in Nassau County.
Some people involved in the bidding expect that two of the three available licenses will go to Resorts World New York City at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens and the Empire City Casino in Yonkers. The two so-called racinos, or slot machine parlors attached to horse tracks, are seeking full-scale casino licenses.
"We think one is going to go to Yonkers," Marty Burger, the chief executive of Silverstein Properties, said. "And one is going to go to Aqueduct." The third, he believes, is "up for grabs."
State officials have not set a deadline for the submission of bids, and the approval process is expected to extend into next year. But Mr. Silverstein's announcement is probably among the last major proposals to be unveiled before the formal bidding begins.
Mr. Cohen has not put forth his proposal, but some details have begun to emerge. It involves turning a parking lot into a 25-acre park with a casino and connections to Flushing Bay, with a design by SHoP Architects, the firm that designed Barclays Center, according to a person who has seen the proposal.
On Wednesday, on the 38th floor at 7 World Trade Center, which Silverstein Properties owns and where it has its headquarters, company executives pitched local elected officials on their project, a 1.8-million-square-foot development called the Avenir, the French word for "future."
Codesigned by Nancy Ruddy of the CetraRuddy architecture firm, the building would consist of two 46-story towers connected by a sky bridge and resting on an eight-story podium. It would house at least one hotel, about 100 units of income-restricted housing, a penthouse performance hall and, at its base, the casino.
Political sentiment in Manhattan remains an obstacle.
"I don't feel like there's any momentum from actual voters or people who live here for a casino in Manhattan," said Liz Krueger, a Democrat who chairs the State Senate's Finance Committee.
State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Councilman Erik Bottcher, whose districts include the proposed site, attended the Wednesday meeting. Both declined to comment on the proposal.
Like the Related Companies' proposal, the Silverstein casino would be near the Javits Convention Center and its steady stream of event attendees. But unlike Related's proposal, which would probably rise on a not-yet-built platform over a rail yard, Mr. Burger described the Silverstein site as "shovel-ready."
Mr. Silverstein's plot of land still houses the foundation of an old Mercedes-Benz dealership. On Thursday, the rocky land beneath the foundation, crisscrossed by graffiti-covered Amtrak rail tunnels, had at least one resident: a young man who declined to give his name and said he had been living there for about a year and a half. The tunnels were strewn with discarded clothing and a Citi Bike.
Casinos are a new interest for Mr. Silverstein. "I don't go to racetracks," he told the luxury real-estate publication Mansion Global in 2017. "I don't go to the casinos. I don't do any of that, but I enjoy buying real estate."
On Thursday, Mr. Silverstein said his own distaste for gambling was beside the point.
"My personal predilections are subordinated to the needs of the community at large," he said.

NEW YORK — The scrum of millionaires and billionaires hustling for the right to build a casino in New York City now includes Larry Silverstein, the real estate magnate who redeveloped much of the World Trade Center site after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Silverstein, 92, has never owned or invested in a casino. But he controls a site at 11th Avenue and 41st Street, four blocks west of Times Square, that he says is perfect for one because it borders several neighborhoods but is central to none. For that reason, his team argues, the location is less likely than others to raise residents’ hackles.
For casino expertise, he has teamed up with Watche Manoukian, a businessperson based in London who owns Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, that state’s highest grossing venue.
In an interview on Thursday, Silverstein suggested his bid was largely selfless: New York state, he said, needs tax revenue to support the transit system on which New York City’s economy depends. Casinos can provide it, and as a major landlord, he is invested in the city’s future.
“We do see it as a genuine need that the community has, the city and Albany,” Silverstein, the chairman of Silverstein Properties, said. “Will it be profitable? I presume so because generally, this has been the case with casinos at large.”
It is a novel argument in a crowded, well-financed field of competitors teeming with unique pitches (one proposal involves a roller coaster; another, a Ferris wheel). About 10 teams are expected to bid for one of up to three licenses for full-scale casinos in the region.
The field includes SL Green Realty Corp., which calls itself the city’s largest commercial landlord and wants to build a casino in Times Square with Caesars Entertainment; Hudson Yards developer Related Cos. and Wynn Resorts, which have proposed a casino on Manhattan’s Far West Side; hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, who owns the New York Mets and has developed a bid with Hard Rock for a casino next to the team’s Queens stadium; and Las Vegas Sands, which wants to put a casino in Nassau County.
Some people involved in the bidding process expect that two of the three available licenses will go to Resorts World New York City at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens and the Empire City Casino in Yonkers. The two so-called racinos, or slot machine parlors attached to horse tracks, are seeking full-scale casino licenses.
“We think one is going to go to Yonkers,” Marty Burger, the CEO of Silverstein Properties, said. “And one is going to go to Aqueduct.” The third, he believes, is “up for grabs.”
State officials have not set a deadline for the submission of bids, and the approval process is expected to extend into next year. But Silverstein’s announcement is probably among the last major proposals to be unveiled before the formal bidding begins.
Cohen has not put forth his proposal, but some details have begun to leak out. It involves turning a parking lot into a 25-acre park with a casino and connections to Flushing Bay, with a design by SHoP Architects, the firm that designed Barclays Center, according to a person who has seen the proposal.
On Wednesday, on the 38th floor at 7 World Trade Center, which Silverstein Properties owns and where it has its headquarters, company executives pitched local elected officials on their project, a 1.8-million-square-foot development called the Avenir, the French word for “future.”
Codesigned by Nancy Ruddy of the CetraRuddy architecture firm, the building would consist of two 46-story towers connected by a sky bridge and resting on an eight-story podium. The development would house at least one hotel, about 100 units of income-restricted housing, a penthouse performance hall and, at its base, the casino.
Political sentiment in Manhattan remains an obstacle.
“I don’t feel like there’s any momentum from actual voters or people who live here for a casino in Manhattan,” said Liz Krueger, a Democrat who chairs the state Senate’s Finance Committee.
State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Councilman Erik Bottcher, whose districts include the proposed site, attended the meeting Wednesday. Both declined to comment on the proposal.
Like the Related Cos.’ proposal, the Silverstein casino would be near the Javits Convention Center and the steady stream of people it draws to events there. But unlike Related’s proposal, which would probably rise on a not-yet-built platform over a rail yard, Burger described the Silverstein site as “shovel-ready.”
On a visit Thursday afternoon, Silverstein’s plot of land still housed the foundation of an old Mercedes-Benz dealership. The rocky land beneath the foundation, crisscrossed by graffiti-covered Amtrak rail tunnels, had at least one resident: a young man who declined to give his name and said he had been living beneath the lot for about a year and a half. The tunnels were strewn with discarded clothing and a Citi Bike.
Casinos are a recently discovered interest for Silverstein. In 2017, he told the luxury real-estate publication Mansion Global that he disliked gambling. “I don’t go to racetracks,” he said. “I don’t go to the casinos. I don’t do any of that, but I enjoy buying real estate.”
On Thursday, Silverstein said his own distaste for gambling was beside the point.
“My personal predilections are subordinated to the needs of the community at large,” he said.

Can Federal Investment Persuade America To Go Green?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Electric vehicles are rare in Moses Lake, Wash., a small city in the fertile Columbia Basin about a three-hour drive east of Seattle. In that conservative farms-and-factories community, few people have the cash or the inclination. The only electric vehicle I saw during a two-day visit last month was a Tesla in the hotel parking lot.
Over the next few years, however, hundreds of Moses Lake residents are going to be entering the electric vehicle business. Two different companies, attracted by cheap hydropower, are opening plants there, each backed by $ 100 million in federal money, to produce a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries.
The investment is part of the roughly half a trillion dollars the Biden administration is marshaling to transform an economy fueled by carbon into one fueled by clean, renewable energy, and it illustrates a gamble at the heart of that broader effort.
Instead of delivering electric vehicles, solar panels and other green technologies at the lowest possible cost, no matter their country of origin, the Biden administration is determined to use this opportunity to expand domestic manufacturing. And it is concentrating much of that effort in rural and Rust Belt communities, where reactionary politics have taken hold most strongly. The plan to combat global warming is also a bid for industrial revival and a transformed political landscape.
There is a real risk that President Biden's economic and political aims will come into conflict with his environmental goals. If domestic production results in higher costs, that could suppress demand for electric vehicles. Political opposition to renewable energy, on the rise in many conservative communities, could impede production. But giving people an economic stake in the transition to green energy may well be the nation's best chance to build a durable political consensus in favor of confronting global warming.
The novelist Upton Sinclair observed, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."
Well, the opposite is true, too.
In Moses Lake, where one city official described the local version of the American dream to me as "house-boat-truck," it is possible to imagine that one day in the not-too-distant future, workers at the battery plants will be driving electric pickups.
The environmental case for investing 200 million tax dollars in Moses Lake is that gas-powered vehicles produce 24 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, and persuading consumers to drive electric vehicles instead is going to require a lot of batteries that are more powerful and more affordable than what's available today.
Right now, almost all electric vehicles are powered by batteries that use graphite to store electricity. Scientists have long known that silicon can hold more energy than graphite. But silicon swells as it charges, with results much like a soda can left in a freezer. The two companies building factories in Moses Lake, Sila Nanotechnologies and Group14 Technologies, make specially modified forms of silicon that solve the swelling problem. Batteries using the special sand can propel vehicles up to 20 percent farther than existing batteries. Recharging is a lot faster, too.
At Group14's first plant, outside Seattle, trays of carbon that look like badly burned brownies emerge from a long oven and are milled into a powder so fine that a thimbleful could coat a hockey rink. The key to Group14's technology is that each of those tiny grains of carbon is about two-thirds air, like a very porous sponge or a coral reef. The grains are then placed in a chamber of silane, a gaseous form of silicon, which fills about half of their interiors, leaving room for expansion when the silicon is charged. The resulting black powder is shipped to battery plants, where it will be painted onto thin strips of metal and stacked inside batteries.
Sila, which uses a different process to reach similar ends, has its own small factory at its Bay Area headquarters. Together, the two companies make enough powder to power a few hundred vehicles per year. The factories in Moses Lake, which together will cost more than $ 700 million, will each produce enough for about 200,000 vehicles a year. Group14 has signed Porsche as an investor and a customer; Sila is working with Mercedes-Benz.
Both companies say they would have moved ahead even without direct federal funding. But the money does mean that they can grow faster. Rick Luebbe, the chief executive of Group14, said the company was able to raise additional capital on the back of the federal money, allowing it to build two production lines in Moses Lake rather than one. "It's a validation for people who want to work for us, for people who want to support us, and for customers," he said.
It would take 400 more factories the size of the ones in Moses Lake to make enough silicon to power all the vehicles produced in an average year. But the government isn't betting just on silicon. It is simultaneously funding an even bigger expansion of graphite manufacturing at factories in Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee. It's also backing companies pursuing other alternatives to graphite, and other potential breakthroughs in battery technology. The government is trying to pick winners only in the sense that it wants the next big idea in batteries to be made in the United States.
Backing domestic production marks a break with decades of federal economic policy that treated low prices as the primary goal, and imports as the best way to achieve that goal. In 2005, for example, the government introduced tax credits for the installation of solar panels, without restrictions on the country of origin. Over the next six years, imports of Chinese solar panels increased to $ 2.7 billion a year, up from $ 21 million a year.
Chinese companies also have raced ahead in the market for electric vehicle batteries, but the Biden administration is hoping to leapfrog them by investing in a new generation of ideas. China controls three-quarters of the world's supply of graphite, but "our technology requires sand and energy," said Gene Berdichevsky, the chief executive of Sila. "Those can be sourced in quite a lot of places."
The federal government is also rigging the competition against Chinese producers. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, buyers of electric vehicles are eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500. But as of April 18, the credit is available only if at least half of the value of the vehicle's battery was produced in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and at least 40 percent of the minerals were produced in the United States or by an approved list of allies. Over the next few years, those requirements will gradually rise to 100 percent for the battery and 80 percent for the minerals.
Other subsidies could take an additional $ 9,000 off the price of cars with American batteries. The incentives are enough that for the first time, some electric vehicles are now cheaper than comparable gas-powered cars.
The residents of Moses Lake are eagerly anticipating the benefits.
Adan Lopez, 20, is studying physics at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake. He isn't sure whether he wants to stay in the area. "Jobs are kind of limited around here," he said. "If you want to do anything, people have to go to Spokane or Seattle."
Brant Mayo, executive director of the Grant County Economic Development Council, said the Moses Lake region has been chasing factories since the early 1990s to bring higher-paying jobs to the area. "We want our kids and our grandkids, if they want to be in the area, to have an opportunity to do whatever they want here," he said.
Factories also attract factories. After Microsoft opened a data center in the nearby town of Quincy, a company that makes plastic conduits for data centers opened a 50-employee operation. Three electrical firms also have opened offices.
The potential costs of trying to orchestrate economic development are less obvious and less concentrated, and thus easier to ignore. But they could easily outweigh the benefits. Government investment can allow companies to take risks that investors wouldn't support, but it also can insulate companies from market discipline, propping up underperforming technologies and preventing better ideas from gaining traction. Preserving factory jobs also is expensive, and higher costs could slow the adoption of electric vehicles. It costs about twice as much to build a battery plant in the United States as in China, according to one recent estimate.
The urgency of global warming means that the Biden administration may be gambling with time it can't afford to lose.
Moses Lake, population 26,040, was created by federal investment. The area was a sparsely populated desert until the damming of the Columbia River began in the 1930s. The Democratic Party's vision of cheap power and water created one of the nation's most productive farming regions, famous for its apples and potatoes. But the city and the surrounding region are now "bright red," in the words of Steve Starr, the lonesome chairman of the local Democratic Party.
Mr. Starr is skeptical that this new season of federally funded economic growth will make a difference. Other issues loom larger. At the county fairgrounds, the Democrats have a building with a big sign out front reminding visitors about the government's role in the region's history. The Republican Party's building, just across the way, has a large sign declaring opposition to abortion.
Mr. Starr also says the government's role in the current factory boom is easy for people to ignore. Instead of public works, the government is backing private companies. The sign in front of Group14's future factory doesn't have any mention of federal funding.
"Without the federal government this would be an uninhabited desert, but you won't hear Republicans here say that," Mr. Starr said. "Are people going to accept the idea that Biden, through federal government initiatives, is helping our economy? My answer is, sadly, probably not."
Some Republicans insist they don't want the help. The congressman who represents Moses Lake, Dan Newhouse, joined all but a few of his Republican colleagues in voting against the 2021 legislation that is providing funding for the battery plants, and against the 2022 bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, that is providing an even larger block of funding for similar projects. In April, he voted for the House debt ceiling bill that would have rolled back much of that federal funding.
Electric vehicles, in particular, are becoming a partisan battleground. Republican lawmakers in Wyoming introduced a resolution this year calling for the state to ban the sale of electric vehicles by 2035 to "ensure the stability of Wyoming's oil and gas industry." The resolution, which did not pass, directed Wyoming's secretary of state to send a copy to the governor of California, which has a law banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035.
In Moses Lake, the most likely flashpoint is access to power. The cheap, green electricity from two Columbia River dams is still the community's greatest asset and it remains under public control. It is the most important reason Group14 and Sila both chose to build factories here.
But there is not enough of it. The local utility, the Grant County Public Utility District, says that it expects to begin buying electricity from outside the county by 2025. For the battery plants, or other factories, to grow here, the community is going to have to invest in expanding its supply of renewable energy.
Richard Hanover grew up in Moses Lake and now works as the director of development at the Port of Moses Lake, which controls much of the region's industrial land. When he was a child, he said, it didn't seem possible Moses Lake would ever have a chance at the kind of prosperity that is now within reach.
"It wasn't even possible when I started here nine years ago," he said.
Now it is. Will Moses Lake seize the opportunity?

Tesla Will Open Its Charging Network to G.M.'s Electric Vehicles: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric car company, which operates the country's most extensive charging network, struck a similar deal with Ford Motor recently.
General Motors said on Thursday that it would adopt Tesla technology to charge its electric vehicles, including selling models that use the plugs pioneered by Tesla.
The announcement, two weeks after Ford struck a comparable agreement, is likely to make Tesla's plugs the industry standard and squeeze companies that are racing to build similar networks as sales of electric vehicles surge. The agreements mean that owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles will be able to use Tesla chargers, which are often the only ones available in many places and have a reputation for reliability.
"This really almost doubles access to chargers" for G.M. customers, Mary T. Barra, the automaker's chief executive, said during a streamed Twitter conversation with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of Twitter.
Mr. Musk said the deal "is going to be a fundamentally great thing for the advancement of E.V. adoption."
But it may raise concerns that Tesla, which already dominates electric vehicle sales, could overwhelm competitors in the fast-growing charging business.
While G.M. gets access to more chargers, Tesla will make money from selling energy to owners of models made by other automakers. Tesla has been charging owners of those other cars higher rates than owners of its own cars. The electric car company also needs to open up its network to qualify for some of the $ 7.5 billion that the federal government is spending to speed up the construction of charging stations.
By adopting Tesla's charging standard, Ford and G.M. also risk becoming dependent on their most formidable competitor. Neither of the Michigan-based automakers sells anywhere near as many electric cars as Tesla, and neither operates a charging network.
The agreement also has risks for Tesla. The popularity of its cars has created congestion at the company's charging stations in some cities and along some highways. Tesla owners may become irritated that they will now have to queue with cars made by Ford and G.M.
"I don't think Tesla owners will be pleased to watch a Ford Mustang Mach-E getting charged, while they wait in line," said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, who follows the auto industry.
The battle between Tesla's charging plugs and the ones currently used by Ford, G.M. and other automakers recalls the competition between Betamax and VHS video cassettes in the 1980s. VHS ultimately won the battle.
At one level, the competition between the standards is a wonky technical issue with each side claiming its plug is the better choice. But it could have long-lasting implications for the millions of people who are expected to switch to electric vehicles in the coming years.
Tesla sells cars with a plug known as the North American Charging Standard. Ford, G.M. and most other carmakers have sold cars with plugs using the Combined Charging System plug. The two are not compatible.
Fast chargers offered by companies like EVgo typically have both plugs and can charge Teslas as well as cars from manufacturers that use C.C.S., including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo. For most of its roughly 10-year history, Tesla's network -- which operates more than half of the nearly 30,000 fast chargers in the country -- was closed to cars from other manufacturers, but the company recently began allowing other cars to use some of its chargers.
Reaction from competitors was restrained on Thursday. "We support all moves to increase E.V. adoption," Brendan Jones, the chief executive of Blink Charging, said in an email. He added, "We are monitoring the market closely and will adjust if we think necessary."
Investors welcomed the deal. The share prices of Tesla and G.M. were up about 3 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
This year is shaping up to be critical to G.M.'s electric vehicle ambitions. The company is weeks away from offering a battery-powered version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. It also plans to introduce electric iterations of the Blazer and Equinox sport utility vehicles.
Ford is working to accelerate production of its electric F-150 Lightning at a factory in Dearborn, Mich.
Mr. Musk said during the conversation with Ms. Barra that Tesla would not use its control of the nation's largest charging network to disadvantage competitors. But if Tesla's standard becomes dominant, other operators will be reliant on a competitor for information they need to manufacture and install charging networks.
Jonathan Levy, the chief commercial officer of EVgo, said the company hoped that the North American standard "will be published in a way that suppliers across the industry will have access to deliver more charging options for E.V. drivers."
Beginning in early 2024, owners of Ford and G.M. electric vehicles will be able to buy adapters to connect to Tesla fast chargers. In 2025, both companies plan to sell vehicles designed to use Tesla's North American plug. Owners would need an adapter to connect to C.C.S. chargers.
By teaming with an archrival, Ford and G.M. have conceded that they need Tesla's network to sell electric vehicles.
"Dependable, widespread public charging is a key driver to scaling the adoption of E.V.s," Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, said in an email when the company announced its agreement with Tesla last month. "The Tesla Supercharger network has proven reliability and has already established charging corridors across the U.S. and Canada."

U.S. Battery Subsidies Put Allies on Edge: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union is trying to assemble the building blocks to produce electric cars, but subsidies are luring companies to the United States.
European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington's approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany's second-highest-ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe's few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Mr. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
"It's definitely attractive to be in America right now," Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt's chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt's plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said that the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Biden's main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a "massive subsidy race," Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to "jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other."
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles "will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made from European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the I.R.A., which Mr. Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
"You're seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America," said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the E.U. to process at least 40 percent of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of E.U. countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Ms. Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. "Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it's a zero-sum game," she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The I.R.A. has prompted "a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.," Mr. Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5 percent of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. A.C.C. also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen's headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year -- a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany's border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won't reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14 percent of new cars sold in the E.U. in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn't move quickly to aid the battery industry, "you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market," said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $ 17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla's supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Ms. Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. "We're de-risking Europe," she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt's first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world's top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until E.U. officials approve German subsidies.

VASTERAS, Sweden — European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington’s approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany’s second highest ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe’s few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
“It’s definitely attractive to be in America right now,” Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt’s chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt’s plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Joe Biden’s main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a “massive subsidy race,” Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to “jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other.”
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles “will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.

VW Sells Russian Operations, Including an Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker, which quit making cars in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, said it had sold its plant to a local auto dealership chain.
Volkswagen has sold its assembly plant and other operations in Russia to a local auto dealership, more than a year after the German carmaker ceased production in the country following the invasion of Ukraine, the company said on Friday.
Under the deal, which required approval from the Russian government, a Moscow-based dealership called Avilon acquired the assets of Volkswagen Group Rus, the carmaker said. Neither company specified a sales price, but Russia media, citing local records, said Avilon had paid about 125 million euros ( $ 135 million).
Volkswagen made the announcement in a terse statement, and declined to comment further on the deal.
The move makes Volkswagen the latest European carmaker to withdraw from Russia in the past year, joining several hundred other multinational corporations leaving a market where many spent decades currying and constructing. But outrage over Moscow's war in Ukraine, combined with the difficulties coping with tough economic sanctions aimed at punishing Russia, has made the Russian market less attractive.
Mercedes-Benz announced last month that it had sold its Russia division, including an assembly plant, to Avtodom, a Russian investor, roughly a year after it suspended local manufacturing and the export of passenger cars and vans to Russia. The sale included a limited repurchase option, the company said, but it did not give any further details.
Last year, the French automaker Renault negotiated a deal with the Russian government to sell its 68 percent stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest carmaker, to NAMI, an automotive research institute in Moscow, for the price of 1 ruble, with the option of resuming business in the country at a future date.
Volkswagen declined to say whether the sale included a clause to return to Russia. In addition to its plant, in Kaluga, a city in western Russia, the Volkswagen sale included the company's components and leasing divisions.
Avilon did not comment on the sale, and it was not immediately clear what its plans were for the Kaluga plant.
Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Avilon sold Volkswagen vehicles as well as dozens of other Western brands, including Mercedes, Jeep and Rolls-Royce. Since last year, it has also begun selling leading Chinese brands, such as Chery, Great Wall and Zeekr.
Volkswagen spent €774 million building the Kaluga plant, which opened in 2007. Two years later, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew in by helicopter to celebrate the start of full production of several of the company's best-selling models, as well as models from its Skoda line.
The plant had capacity to turn out 225,000 vehicles a year, nearly the number the company delivered to customers in Russia in 2021. Shortly after the invasion in February 2022, Volkswagen ceased operations at the plant. It also quit making cars at another plant, in Nizhny Novgorod, that was owned by the Russian company Gaz Group.
Gaz Group sued Volkswagen over the halt, seeking to freeze the German company's assets in Russia. Last month, a court ruled in Volkswagen's favor.
Over the past year, the Kaluga plant's 4,000 employees remained on the payroll as they waited for information on whether they would be allowed to return to work. The idle plant was a financial drain on Volkswagen, which is scrambling to expand its electric vehicle offerings and revamp its core brand. It is also losing ground to local brands in China, the world's largest auto market.
Observers believe that large companies waited for several months to gauge the situation before deciding whether to pull out of Russia. Large multinational companies that had spent several decades building supply chains and networks realized that the complexity and reach of those systems made it difficult to bring them to a swift halt, said Sebastian Hoppe, a political economist at Berlin's Free University who researches Russia.
"The more suppliers you have in Russia itself, the harder it is to pull out and the longer this whole process takes," Mr. Hoppe said.
Carmakers in Russia employed 300,000 people in 2021, according to the country's statistics agency, and up to 3.5 million more are estimated to work in related industries. Those jobs have been devastated over the past year, as auto production has dropped 77 percent in large part because Western firms have pulled up stakes.
Other firms are also deciding to turn their back on Russia. Henkel, a German maker of washing powder and other household products, and Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, sold their factories to local buyers in Russia this year.
The sale of factories and other assets may have come at a loss, but many Western companies do not expect Russia's economy to return to normal growth in the near future.
"What I think is also important, it is of course the case that the Russian market tends to be less attractive than it was before the war," Mr. Hoppe said.

In Potential Shake-Up, Ex-U.F.C. Champion Joins a Rival Company: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The unusual mixed martial arts deal allows Ngannou, a former heavyweight titleholder for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to compete in a boxing matchup this year.
Francis Ngannou, a former Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight champion, has signed an unusual multifight contract with a rival promotional company, the Professional Fighters League, ending a highly publicized free-agency period that highlighted contentious themes of fighter pay and athlete influence in the evolving world of mixed martial arts.
Ngannou and the P.F.L. announced Tuesday that they had agreed to what they labeled a "strategic partnership," a deal that gives Ngannou equity and leadership roles in the mixed martial arts company while also letting him pursue outside boxing fights. Ngannou intends to fight a mixed martial arts bout in the P.F.L. in mid-2024, after competing in a boxing ring sometime this year.
None of Ngannou's fights have been set.
The terms of the deal, including finances and its duration, were not disclosed by Ngannou or the P.F.L. "Let's just say, all-in my deal with P.F.L. is more than anyone else offered," Ngannou said.
As part of the agreement, Ngannou will become chairman of P.F.L. Africa, an expansion initiative to produce events on the continent, and will serve on the company's advisory board to represent fighter interests.
"The past few months have been a very interesting time to understand and see the landscape but I'm very excited about this deal with the P.F.L. because they basically showed what I was expecting," Ngannou said in an interview. "They didn't just show up as a promotion that was looking for a fighter, but really came as a partner that sees more value in you as a person."
Ngannou will fight in the league's nascent Super Fight division, which was created to attract fighters to sign deals with more favorable terms than are generally available in the sport, including bigger guarantees and bigger cuts of pay-per-view revenue.
Jake Paul, the social media influencer turned boxer who signed a similar deal with the league in January, and Kayla Harrison, a two-time P.F.L. champion and Olympic gold medalist in judo who is the league's most popular fighter, are also signed to the Super Fight division.
By entering the P.F.L., Ngannou and Paul, two of the biggest critics of how the U.F.C. pays its athletes, are joining one of its biggest competitors.
Ngannou, 36, a native of Cameroon who moved to the United States after beginning his mixed martial arts career in France, entered the U.F.C. in 2015 and became the heavyweight champion in 2021. But before the last fight on his U.F.C. contract in January 2022, Ngannou said he was prepared to leave the promotional company if they could not reach an agreement on a new contract.
Among his desired terms, he said, was an increase in salary and the ability to box. Ngannou had teased a crossover bout with Tyson Fury, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, but athletes under contract with the U.F.C. must fight exclusively within the promotion.
Ngannou won his final U.F.C. fight, successfully defending his belt against Ciryl Gane, and the two sides continued negotiating with hopes of agreeing to a new deal and a bout with Jon Jones, who had moved up to heavyweight after a three-year layoff and who is one of the greatest fighters in U.F.C. history. But Ngannou and the U.F.C. reached an impasse, and in January, the company released Ngannou and stripped him of his title.
"We get to this point, and I've told you guys this before, if you don't want to be here, you don't have to be here," Dana White, the U.F.C. president, told reporters in January. "I think Francis is in a place right now where he doesn't want to take a lot of risks. He feels he's in a good position where he can fight lesser opponents and make more money, so we're going to let him do that."
Recently valued at $ 12.1 billion and owned by the media and entertainment agency Endeavor, the U.F.C. is considered the world's most powerful mixed martial arts promotion with the deepest roster of athletes. But some critics, including current and former fighters, have dogged the company for its pay and restrictive contracts.
Fighters earn less than 20 percent of total revenue, which includes pay-per-view sales and other sources of cash flow like ticket sales and sponsorships. In the N.F.L., where athletes have unionized, for example, players receive roughly 50 percent of league revenue.
Athletes are not unionized in combat sports, including mixed martial arts and boxing. In 2014 and 2021, a group of fighters filed lawsuits against the U.F.C., accusing it of running an illegal monopoly. The litigation is continuing.
The Professional Fighters League made its debut in 2018, and though it does not yet rival the U.F.C. in stature, it has garnered a fan base through its television deal with ESPN and its season-like format, which is uncommon for combat sports.
Ngannou and the P.F.L. started negotiating soon after he became a free agent, said Peter Murray, the league's chief executive. Ngannou said he engaged in advanced talks with only one other promotion, the Singapore-based ONE Championship, though executives for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bellator MMA said they had exploratory conversations with Ngannou.
"They didn't have much to offer more than a fighter and promotion contract, which was something that I wasn't interested in," Ngannou said of ONE's contract offer. "I was looking into value and an impact and what I can bring it and attach also to my legacy."
He added: "I think there was a lot of media play, and a lot of people just know that this game wasn't big enough for this type of a deal, so they just stepped out."
Popular fighters, such as Jones, Jorge Masvidal and Henry Cejudo, have threatened to retire to create leverage for earning larger payouts. Conor McGregor, the sport's biggest and highest-paid star, barbed with White in media interviews over whether he should be given equity shares in the company.
"This is not an athlete deal. Francis is an icon today in the sport, he is the best in the world at what he does, but he's in business with the P.F.L.," Murray said. "We're in business together."
Murray said the P.F.L.'s expansion to Africa is slated to start in 2024, with the hope of staged events taking place in 2025. The process, to be led in part by Ngannou, includes scouring the continent for fighters and for countries to host fights. Ngannou said he saw Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa as early targets. In the meantime, he said he would like to have a boxing match this year before fighting again in mixed martial arts.
The challenge now for Murray and P.F.L. executives is to successfully build the league's pay-per-view division and find opponents for Ngannou, Harrison and Paul that will be draws for fans -- to watch and to pay for.
Though the P.F.L. is funded by its media rights deals, sponsorships and ticket sales, pay-per-view buys are one of the biggest financial drivers in mixed martial arts. Harrison headlined the P.F.L.'s first and only pay-per-view event last November. By comparison, the U.F.C. staged 13 pay-per-view fights in 2022.
"Launching pay-per-view combined with launching regional leagues -- that is what will drive scale and that's what the league is focused on," Murray said.
The P.F.L. had to reshuffle parts of its 2023 season on Friday after a group of fighters were suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The league and the commission did not officially disclose the reason, but the P.F.L. said in a statement it had a "zero-tolerance policy related to the usage of banned substances."
During his free agency, Ngannou became a polarizing figure among fans and fighters, who said he had made a mistake by declining the U.F.C.'s offers to stay. On Twitter, he posted an image of himself sitting atop a luxury Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle, with a caption mocking their claims that he "fumbled the bag." Now with the P.F.L., he said his decision was worth it.
"When people don't understand you, what you're doing, obviously there's a lot of criticism, but when you're confident and certain of what you're doing and where you're going and aware of achievement, you just have to be patient and welcome the time everybody sees it," he said.

Full text: Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula 1, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 miles an hour. His head bounces inside the cockpit as a wheel shudders over a rumble strip. It's hard to hear over the banshee shriek of his V6 engine, carrying three times the horsepower of a run-of-the-mill Porsche Carrera.
Then the noise stops, and Baku vanishes. We're inside a low-slung brick building nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside. The track, projected onto a CinemaScope-sized wraparound screen, was a mirage, part of a sophisticated training simulator. (F1 rules prohibit driving the real cars between races.) Mr. Sargeant climbs out of a replica driver's seat wearing athletic pants. He won't need a fireproof suit until later.
In three weeks' time, Mr. Sargeant will do this for real: wind whipping his visor, G-forces of up to six times his body weight pressing on his neck, the ever-present threat of a catastrophic crash as he is watched by roughly 70 million people around the world. For now, it's time for lunch. "Is chili bad for you?" he asks, digging into a bowl at his team's commissary. "I don't think it's that bad."
Reaching Formula 1, the highest level of international motor sport, is a big step for Mr. Sargeant, 22, a South Florida native who began racing rudimentary cars known as karts at 6 years old and this year joined the Williams Racing team as the first full-time American F1 driver since 2007.
For Formula 1 itself, finding a hometown hero for American fans is a giant leap.
Although it is enormously popular in Europe, F1 struggled for decades to break into the United States. That began to change in 2016, when the sport was purchased for $ 4.4 billion by the Colorado-based Liberty Media, owned by the cable magnate John Malone. Liberty ramped up its social media -- F1 had barely kept a YouTube page -- and backed a popular Netflix documentary series, "Drive to Survive." Once geared toward aging white men, F1 now has a younger and more diverse fan base. American TV viewership is up 220 percent from 2018, and the sport made $ 2.6 billion in revenue last year.
Still, a subset of F1 devotees complain about what they see as an overemphasis on entertainment and ginned-up drama. Under Liberty, they argue, pure racing is taking a back seat to cheap tricks to reel in casual viewers. And they often use a dirty word for it: Americanization. "It is becoming more and more like Formula Hollywood," Bernie Ecclestone, the 92-year-old Briton who built F1 into a global business, griped last year. "F1 is being made more and more for the American market."
The backlash reached a crescendo at last week's Miami Grand Prix, which was added in 2022 as a showpiece for American fans. In a prizefight-style pre-race ceremony, the rapper LL Cool J introduced the 20 drivers one by one amid swirling smoke and a squad of cheerleaders. Nearby, Will.i.am conducted a live orchestra playing the rap song he recently recorded with Lil Wayne as part of a "global music collaboration" with Formula 1. (The lyrics rhyme "Max Verstappen," the name of the sport's top driver, with "your champion.")
"Pandering to the American audience is killing @F1," wrote one fan on Twitter, echoing criticism that bubbled up across numerous F1 websites. Even the racers complained: "None of the drivers like it," groused Lando Norris, a Briton who drives for McLaren. Undeterred, Liberty announced that the bombastic pre-race sequence would be featured at several more grands prix this year.
In the United States, F1 has long been associated with a certain European mystique. Its drivers race across the Ardennes forest (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium), the plains of Lombardy (Italy's Autodromo Nazionale di Monza) and, most famously, the louche glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix. The sport's stateside image could be summed up by the 2006 comedy, "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as a pretentious French F1 driver named Jean Girard, a snooty Eurotrash foil to Will Ferrell's macho NASCAR cowboy.
In 2023, F1 can feel a bit more Ricky Bobby than Jean Girard. In Miami, drivers circled a track built in the parking lot of the Dolphins football stadium, past an artificial Monaco-style "harbor": blue-painted asphalt topped with ersatz yachts. A new Las Vegas race in November will have cars zooming down the Strip past Caesars Palace. Meanwhile, traditional races in France and Germany are gone.
Katy Fairman, a journalist based in Brighton, England, who runs the F1 podcast "Small Torque," said she was surprised by the spectacle when she attended a race in Austin, Texas. "There were girls with pompoms," she said. "I remember watching it and thinking, Oh my gosh, this is so different from anything I'd seen F1 do in a long time."
Ms. Fairman conceded that some Europeans find the American hullabaloo "tacky." But she added: "When it's something to do with America, I think Europeans are quite judgmental. I think it's just a bit of lighthearted fun. You guys like to have a party."
The arrival of Mr. Sargeant, who grew up about an hour's drive from the Miami racetrack, has spurred new interest, including a profile and photo shoot in GQ, and he's happy to play the part. "What's up America, let's bring that energy!" he shouted to the cameras after LL Cool J introduced him as "the local boy done good."
But as with F1, there are growing pains. In Miami, Mr. Sargeant finished last, his race ruined on the first lap when he damaged a front wing. After the checkered flag, he apologized to his team, his voice barely a whisper: "I'm so sorry. I can't believe it."
Weeks earlier, in an interview in England, Mr. Sargeant had demurred about the pressure of wearing the stars and stripes. "I try not to get too caught up in the talk of the role of 'first American,"' he said. "It's still very early for me, and I have a lot to learn still."
If Mr. Sargeant doesn't perform, there are dozens of drivers eager to take his spot. "At the moment," he said, "I just have to worry about staying here."
'I just want to get back in the gym.'
Before his tough Miami weekend, Mr. Sargeant was asked how he would celebrate a top 10 finish. "Honestly, it might sound lame, but probably just go back to my house and get in my bed for another night before I go back to London," he replied. "That's all I want to do."
For a wealthy, handsome, globe-trotting athlete, Mr. Sargeant can be soft-spoken and endearingly self-conscious. It's not unusual for someone who, like a tennis prodigy or Olympian gymnast, has devoted their life since childhood to a sole pursuit.
Mr. Sargeant was 6 when he and his brother Dalton got a kart from their parents for Christmas. "No one in the family was really even that much into racing," Logan said. "We just picked it up as a hobby, something to do on the weekend." He began winning junior races around the country -- too easily. To reach the next level and pursue Formula 1, he'd have to leave behind his friends and beloved fishing excursions for life on a different continent: "We just needed a higher level of competition, and at the end of the day, that was in Europe."
Mr. Sargeant left Florida before his 13th birthday, bouncing between Italy, Switzerland and Britain as he raced on the European junior circuit; in 2015, he became the first American to win the Karting World Championship since 1978. "As a kid, it was tough," he recalled. "Coming from Florida, being outdoors all the time on the water, great weather -- it was literally vice versa." He eventually settled in London, where he spends most days working out with a trainer. "I get away from a race weekend, and I just want to get back in the gym," he said. "I hate that feeling of leaving slack on the table."
It is incredibly difficult to nab a seat in Formula 1. Today's drivers are physical dynamos trained to optimize their reflexes and performance levels down to how well they can withstand jet lag -- critical in a sport that this year will include 23 grands prix spread over five continents. F1 teams employ hundreds of employees and spend hundreds of millions of dollars developing the world's most sophisticated racecars. But it's ultimately up to the driver to execute.
It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion and F1's only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Mr. Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida's Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald J. Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan's father, Daniel Sargeant, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $ 6.5 million in corporate funds "for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities" of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $ 5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesman said that Logan Sargeant was not "in a position to comment" on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Mr. Sargeant's Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was sanctioned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Mr. Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. "I'm incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan's here for any other reason than I think he's got this pure talent," he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Mr. Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year's two other rookies. "He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more," Mr. Vowles said. "He's a perfectionist, and I like that in him."
Tooting around in a Vauxhall Astra
Britain, where Formula 1 originated in 1950, remains the sport's spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it's now an American subsidiary: a Manhattan private equity firm, Dorilton Capital, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $ 200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, like engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park -- a far cry from McLaren's space-age complex an hour's drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Mr. Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team's sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $ 60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure Mr. Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
"Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years," he said in an interview. "There are eager companies who want the publicity." Mr. Sargeant's car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading "Go Logan!" alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year's race fell about 25 percent, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data show that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, N.C., and Tulsa, Okla. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $ 90 million annually -- up from the $ 5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes. "We were too arrogant," he said. "We couldn't understand why the American fan base wasn't falling in love with us." But he also pushed back on the complaints that Liberty's efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
"This whole argument of 'Americanization,' it's a very crude way to describe things," he said. "We shouldn't ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It's about giving people more choices in the modern era. It's modernization of access to everyone."
Mr. Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty's approach. "I mean jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J," he told reporters in Miami. "I thought it was cool, wasn't an issue to me."
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler -- something Mr. Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
"I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine," he said. "But to be honest, I'm not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn't really interest me."
"The part that interests me," he concluded, "is driving them as fast as I can go."

It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time world champion and F1’s only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida’s Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan’s father, Daniel, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $6.5 million in corporate funds “for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities” of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money-laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesperson said Logan Sargeant was not “in a position to comment” on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Sargeant’s Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s, was sanctioned after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. “I’m incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan’s here for any other reason than I think he’s got this pure talent,” he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year’s two other rookies. “He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more,” Vowles said. “He’s a perfectionist, and I like that in him.”
Commuting in a Compact Car
Britain, where Formula One originated in 1950, remains the sport’s spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it’s now an American subsidiary: Dorilton Capital, a private equity firm in New York City, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, such as engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park — a far cry from McLaren’s space-age complex an hour’s drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team’s sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure that Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
“Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years,” he said in an interview. “There are eager companies who want the publicity.” Sargeant’s car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading “Go Logan!” alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year’s race fell about 25%, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data shows that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, North Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $90 million annually — up from the $5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes.
“We were too arrogant,” he said. “We couldn’t understand why the American fan base wasn’t falling in love with us.” But he pushed back on complaints that Liberty’s efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
“This whole argument of ‘Americanization,’ it’s a very crude way to describe things,” he said. “We shouldn’t ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It’s about giving people more choices in the modern era. It’s modernization of access to everyone.”
Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty’s approach. “I mean, jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J,” he told reporters in Miami. “I thought it was cool, wasn’t an issue to me.”
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler — something Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
“I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine,” he said. “But to be honest, I’m not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn’t really interest me.”
“The part that interests me,” he said, “is driving them as fast as I can go.”

Labor Victory in South With a Vote to Unionize: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Friday's victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor.
Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South.
The company, Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Ga., may lack the cachet of Amazon or the ubiquity of Starbucks, two other corporations that have attracted union attention. But the 697-to-435 vote by Blue Bird's workers to join the United Steelworkers was the first significant organizing election at a factory receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by President Biden.
"This is just a bellwether for the future, particularly in the South, where working people have been ignored," Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Friday evening after the vote. "We are now in a place where we have the investments coming in and a strategy for lifting up wages and protections for a good high-road future."
The three bills making up that investment include a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change.
Each of the bills included language to help unions expand their membership, and Blue Bird's management, which opposed the union drive, had to contend with the Democrats' subtle assistance to the Steelworkers.
Blue Bird stands to benefit from the new federal funds. Last year, it hailed the $ 500 million that the Biden administration was providing through the infrastructure bill for the replacement of diesel-powered school buses with zero- and low-emission buses. Georgia school systems alone will get $ 51.1 million to buy new electric buses, but Blue Bird sells its buses across the country. Still more money will come through the Inflation Reduction Act, another law praised by the company.
But that money came with strings attached -- strings that subtly tilted the playing field toward the union. Just two weeks ago, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, pushed a demand on all recipients of federal subsidies to detail the health insurance, paid leave, retirement and other benefits they were offering their workers.
They also required the companies to have "committed to remain neutral in any organizing campaign and/or to voluntarily recognize a union based on a show of majority support." And under the rules of the infrastructure bill, no federal money may to be used to thwart a union election.
The Steelworkers union used the rules to its advantage. In late April, it filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against Blue Bird's management, citing $ 40 million in rebates the company had received from the E.P.A., which stipulated that those funds could not be used for anti-union activity.
"The rules say if workers want a union, you can't use any money to hire anti-union law firms, or use people to scare workers," Daniel Flippo, director of the Steelworkers district that covers the Southeast, said before the vote. "I'm convinced Blue Bird has done that."
Politicians also got involved. Georgia's two Democratic senators and southwestern Georgia's Democratic House member also subtly nudged the plant's management, in a union-hostile but politically pivotal state, to at least keep the election fair.
"I have been a longtime supporter of the USW and its efforts to improve labor conditions and living standards for workers in Georgia," the Democratic congressman, Representative Sanford Bishop, wrote of the United Steelworkers in an open letter to Blue Bird workers. "I want to encourage you in your effort to exercise your rights granted by the National Labor Relations Act."
Blue Bird's management minimized such pressure in its public statements, even as it fought hard to beat back union organizers.
"Although we respect and support the right for employees to choose, we do not believe that Blue Bird is better served by injecting a labor union into our relationship with employees," said Julianne Barclay, a spokeswoman for the company. "During the pending election campaign, we have voiced our opinion to our employees that a union is not in the best interest of the company or our employees."
Friday's union victory has the labor movement thinking big as the federal money continues to flow, and that could be good for Mr. Biden and other Democrats, especially in the pivotal state of Georgia.
"Workers at places like Blue Bird, in many ways, embody the future," Mr. Flippo said after the vote, adding, "For too long, corporations cynically viewed the South as a place where they could suppress wages and working conditions because they believed they could keep workers from unionizing."
The Blue Bird union shop, 1,400 workers strong, will be one of the biggest in the South, and union leaders said it could be a beachhead as they eyed new electric vehicle suppliers moving in -- and potentially the biggest, most difficult targets: foreign electric vehicle makers like Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which have located in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina in part to avoid unions.
"Companies move there for a reason -- they want as smooth a path toward crushing unions as possible," said Steve Smith, a national spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "But we have federal money rolling in, a friendly administration and a chance to make inroads like we have never had before."
The Blue Bird plant, which rises suddenly off a rural highway lined with peach and pecan orchards, has long made it a practice to hire less educated workers, some of whom have prison records and most of whom start at $ 16 or $ 17 an hour, said Alex Perkins, a main organizer for the United Steelworkers in Georgia.
A union was a tough sell for such vulnerable workers against a management that was fiercely opposed, organizers conceded. Coming off the last shift of the day on Thursday, most workers declined to speak on the record. A clutch of about a dozen workers stood on Friday at the Circle K gas station across the street from the plant in the predawn darkness, holding pro-union signs as the first workers arrived to cast ballots under the gaze of National Labor Relations Board monitors.
But Cynthia Harden, who has worked at the plant for five years and voted in favor of organizing, did talk about the pressure workers were under to vote against it. Slide shows on the voting process, which showed ballots marked "no," said that the company could go broke if the union won, and there was a sudden appearance of food trucks at lunch and banners on the perimeter fence reading, "We Love Our Employees!"
"They've made some changes already, but if the union hadn't started, nothing would have happened," she said.
The letter that Georgia's Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, wrote to Matt Stevenson, Blue Bird's chief executive and president, was remarkably timid, praising the company for its cooperation and its well-paying jobs before "encouraging all involved, whatever their desired outcome, to make sure that the letter and the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act are followed."
Mr. Perkins fumed at that tone, considering the work that unions had put in to help Mr. Warnock win re-election last year. "I won't forget it next time," he said.
Both senators declined requests to comment on the election.

Bruce McCall, 87, Satirical Artist Who Conjured a 'Retrofuture,' Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On New Yorker covers and elsewhere, he lampooned the rich by forecasting a plutocratic fantasyland -- or, as he put it, "looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow."
Bruce McCall, whose satirical illustrations for National Lampoon and The New Yorker conjured up a plutocratic dream world of luxury zeppelin travel, indoor golf courses and cars like the Bulgemobile Airdreme, died on Friday in the Bronx. He was 87.
His wife, Polly McCall, said his death, at Calvary Hospital, was caused by Parkinson's disease.
Borrowing from the advertising style seen in magazines like Life, Look and Collier's in the 1930s and '40s, Mr. McCall depicted a luminous fantasyland filled with airplanes, cars and luxury liners of his own creation. It was a world populated by carefree millionaires who expected caviar to be served in the stations of the fictional Fifth Avenue Subway and carwashes to spray their limousines with champagne.
"My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it," Mr. McCall said in a TED Talk in 2008. He called it "retrofuturism," which he defined as "looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow."
To readers of The New Yorker, which ran more than 80 of his gouache-on-paper paintings as covers beginning in 1993, his visual signature and comic universe were as recognizable as those of the magazine's cartoonists Charles Addams and Roz Chast.
A wider audience knew Mr. McCall through the collections "Bruce McCall's Zany Afternoons" (1982), "The Last Dream-o-Rama: The Cars Detroit Forgot to Build, 1950-1960" (2001), and "All Meat Looks Like South America: The World of Bruce McCall" (2003).
He was "our country's greatest unacknowledged design visionary," the critic and graphic designer Michael Bierut wrote in Design Observer in 2005, "the visual poet of American gigantism."
Bruce Paul Gordon McCall was born on May 10, 1935, in Simcoe, Ontario, to Thomas Cameron and Helen Margaret (Gilbertson) McCall. His father, who was known as T.C., was a civil servant and later Chrysler's public relations manager in Canada. His mother was a homemaker.
Bruce grew up with five siblings in a home tightly circumscribed by T.C.'s paltry salary and the dour provincialism of Simcoe, in the southwest corner of the province, not far from Lake Erie. This childhood purgatory provided the material for his 1997 memoir, "Thin Ice: Coming of Age in Canada." A second memoir, "How Did I Get Here?," was published in 2020.
The family's relocation to Toronto in 1947 did little to change Mr. McCall's feelings about his native country, which he later satirized in a feature for National Lampoon, "The Shame of the North: Life in a Canadian Border Town." It showed, on a supposedly dissolute strip, derelicts swigging maple syrup and louche emporiums promising such forbidden pleasures as "live, hatless girls."
American popular culture sparked his imagination, especially the magazines and their advertising, which transmitted "messages of tomorrow in steel and chrome," he wrote in "Thin Ice."
"Soon, double-decker Boeing Stratocruisers with cocktail lounges would be flying down to Rio in 20 hours," he added. "Standard transportation for Everyman was about to be a car you could fly, a plane you could drive."
After dropping out of high school in Windsor, where the family had moved in 1953, Mr. McCall found work at a local agency that turned out advertisements for Dodge and DeSoto. "The Detroit products at the time -- those behemoths -- were so awful that I found them funny and ridiculous," he told The New Yorker in 2002. "So the roots of satire were planted very early."
He was hired in 1959 by A.V. Roe & Company in Toronto to retouch photos of pots and pans for its catalogs. A year later his fortunes improved, marginally, when the publishing company Maclean-Hunter hired him to churn out brief articles for trade magazines like Pit & Quarry. He loathed the job.
In desperation, Mr. McCall, a sports car enthusiast, collaborated with a friend to start a magazine, Canadian Driver. It lasted only one issue, but it led to a writing job at Canada Track & Traffic, where Mr. McCall soon became editor in chief.
His first crack at the American dream came in 1962, when David E. Davis, the head of the Campbell-Ewald agency in Detroit, which had Chevrolet as a major account, hired him to write ad copy for Corvettes and Corvairs. It was the springboard to a flourishing career in New York, where he initially worked on Ford advertising at J. Walter Thompson. Later, at Ogilvy & Mather, Mr. McCall was put in charge of advertising for Mercedes-Benz; for several years he ran the agency's Frankfurt office.
In 1970, Mr. McCall and his friend Brock Yates, the editor of Car and Driver, invented a series of mythical airplanes, among them the Humbley-Pudge Gallipoli Heavyish Bomber, for which they wrote pseudo-scholarly historical notes. Playboy bought the idea, assigned Mr. McCall to do the illustrations and ran the collaboration in January 1971 under the title "Major Howdy Bixby's Album of Forgotten Warbirds." It went on to win Playboy's annual humor award.
"This went to my head -- in fact rearranged its contents," Mr. McCall told Macmillan in an interview for its website in 2008. "On the basis of that one fluke success, I now felt entitled to see myself as a working professional humorist."
After returning from Germany, he headed for the offices of National Lampoon with a catalog for the mythical 1958 Bulgemobile. The magazine offered him a contract to illustrate 25 pages a year. He was soon delivering spreads on the luxury liner Tyrannic ("So safe that she carries no insurance") and blue-blood sports like tank polo and zeppelin shooting. "Popular Workbench," a series based on his large collection of 1930s popular science magazines, offered such innovations as a 4,000-horsepower diesel typewriter weighing more than three tons.
McCall wrote for "The National Lampoon Radio Hour" and put in a brief, unhappy stint as a writer for "Saturday Night Live" in the late 1970s before returning to advertising. He joined the McCaffrey‌ & McCall agency (co-founded by an unrelated McCall), which had just landed the Mercedes account. After several years as creative director for Mercedes advertising, he was named executive vice president and creative director of the agency. He left in 1993.
By then his career as a writer and illustrator had taken off. Infatuated with The New Yorker since childhood, Mr. McCall submitted a humor article for the magazine's "Shouts and Murmurs" department in 1980, the first of more than 80 to be published over the next 40 years. After Tina Brown became editor in 1992, his illustrations appeared regularly on the magazine's cover and in the back of the book.
Many of his illustrations were on view in 2021 at the New-York Historical Society in the exhibition "The Fantastic City: Bruce McCall's New York." He had long worked from his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by their daughter, Amanda McCall; two brothers, Walter and Michael; and a sister, Christine Jerome.
Mr. McCall wrote the children's book "Marveltown" (2008) and provided the illustrations for "The Steps Across the Water," a 2010 children's book by the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik. He went on to collaborate with David Letterman in 2013 on a lavishly illustrated skewering of the American superrich, "This Land Was Made for You and Me (But Mostly Me): Billionaires in the Wild."

Life With Mom, at the Chelsea Hotel: [Style Desk]

Full text: After an unruly childhood in the Chelsea Hotel and online fame as a yoga parodist, Alexandra Auder writes an ode to bohemian Manhattan and her singular mother, Viva.
PHILADELPHIA -- Alexandra Auder was almost born in the lobby of the Chelsea Hotel, then a febrile bohemian enclave on Manhattan's West 23rd Street, but her mother, Viva, a Warhol superstar, managed to make it to the hospital as the staff egged her on. "A girl! I want a girl!" a bellman declared, helping her into a taxi.
That scene was captured on videotape by Ms. Auder's father, Michel Auder, a French filmmaker who kept his camera running day and night. Ms. Auder was also the star of her mother's 1975 book, "The Baby," which Rolling Stone described as a female rendition of "On the Road," but better written and funnier.
At 52, Ms. Auder has finally pieced together her own version of events. Her decades-in-the-making memoir, "Don't Call Me Home," with a title inspired by a Thomas Wolfe novel and a line from a Nico song, began as a roman à clef called "Frogs" that was her senior thesis at Bard College in Red Hook, N.Y.
She was raised in bohemian mayhem, as her parents careered from film sets and exotic locales to the homes of jet set friends like Roger Vadim and Jane Fonda. Her mother was known for her turns in Warhol's deadpan soft porn films of the late '60s and became a darling of talk show hosts. Born Janet Susan Mary Hoffmann, she was christened Viva by Paul Morrissey, the director and cinematographer of many Warhol films, as they headed out to a party thrown by Shelley Winters.
It might have been on "The Dick Cavett Show" that Viva joked that she'd named herself after the paper towel (the company later sent her a carton, as well as a pink dress for her daughter). Her husband was a handsome practitioner of extreme cinéma vérité with a modest heroin habit and a predilection for beautiful women. He and Viva parted ways when Alexandra was 5, after which, as she writes in her memoir, she and her mother fused.
"Don't Call Me Home," which comes out Tuesday, is an ode to a vanished world -- the feral, slightly squalid world of downtown New York in the 1980s -- and to her mercurial, charismatic mother. Viva was given to dressing down cops, taxi drivers, neighbors, badly behaved children, Ms. Auder's boyfriends and Stanley Bard, the aggrieved manager of the Chelsea, when he cornered her for unpaid rent.
Bohemia is not a lucrative state, and mother and daughter survived on welfare, the largess of friends and family and the meager earnings from Viva's freelance articles and occasional bit parts in films. There was a tiny windfall after Viva and Ms. Auder appeared on "Late Night with David Letterman" in 1983 and Viva asked the audience to send her cash. Mr. Letterman, annoyed, cut their segment short while Viva was still yelling out her address. For some time afterward, envelopes containing dollar bills made their way to "Viva Superstar, c/o The Chelsea Hotel."
"I'm certain that if she and the Dalai Lama were locked in a cell together," Ms. Auder writes of her mother, "and she turned the screw on him, he would crack within the hour. He might even try to kill her because he has been kowtowed to his whole life and never forced to contend with a Viva."
Growing up with a Viva meant catering to her whims, like inveigling Chelsea staff members into running across the street to the deli for Petit Ecolier chocolate biscuits and sweet-talking them into a loan if Ms. Auder couldn't find any cash. It meant managing Viva's darkening moods -- "Mom, you seem a little nervous. You should go on vacation," Ms. Auder, age about 10, might say, and off Viva would go to Mexico or Argentina. And it meant sometimes avoiding her mother altogether by spending the night with Squat Theater, the collective of exiled Hungarian performers who lived above their performance space in a storefront near the Chelsea.
Viva's domestic style was haphazard at best and could veer into chaos if left unchecked, so Ms. Auder also learned to be an excellent, if slightly disgruntled, housekeeper. When her sister, Gaby, was born -- that would be Gaby Hoffmann, the actor who found fame as Kevin Costner's daughter in "Field of Dreams" -- Ms. Auder, age 11, took her on as well, parading along 23rd Street with the baby in the English pram favored by her mother. She doted on Gaby, and kept a list of her first words: Hot. Penis. Bitch. I love you.
Mother and daughters slept in one room, the girls in bunk beds and Viva in a bed wedged between the bunks and a wall. From a top bunk, Ms. Auder could hear her mother flossing her teeth, the swish of her feet and her breathing. Close quarters, indeed.
These days Ms. Auder lives far from the Chelsea, in a century-old stone house in Philadelphia with her husband, Nick Nehéz, a filmmaker and artist she met in college, and their two children, Lui and Miko. She is also far from Viva, who resides in Palm Springs, Calif. Tall and lanky, Ms. Auder resembles her father, but her sense of mischief is all her mother's. She is comedic and expressive, a profane close talker.
She has made a living as a yoga teacher, though she doesn't really like teaching and has a penchant for skewering the pieties of her profession in Instagram parodies filmed by her husband. She has appeared in videos as a clueless self-care influencer, sometimes wrapped in a shearling rug, hawking tinctures with names like One Per Scent and Abundance, thanking Mercedes-Benz for ferrying her to ayahuasca ceremonies, and browbeating a pair of "students" played by naked American Girl dolls marked up with Sharpies.
Yoga was an accident that paid the bills. "I had moved back to the city after college and was living with a friend on Ludlow Street," Ms. Auder said. "I was depressed on the couch, trying to sell my book." That was her senior thesis, her first pass at a story about life with Viva.
"I was like, 'What the hell? I'm not prepared for this,"' she continued. "I didn't know how to have a job. I'd never seen that. I'd only seen these weird artists. I could have been a waitress, but I had this rarefied idea of being a famous actress or selling this book without doing the actual work."
Yoga, she said, got her off the couch. She started teaching and moved in with Mr. Nehéz, who was finishing up at Bard. He built her a studio in nearby Tivoli, which for a time was the only yoga game in town, and her sideways career commenced. "In my mind I was like, 'I'll just do this for a couple of years,"' she said.
The book mostly languished. She'd often drag out the manuscript and read passages to her husband, until he made her stop. Her mother read it early on, too, and at some point began calling it the "Mommie Dearest" book. Ms. Auder and her husband also tackled Viva cinematically in a 2004 short, "Viva Viva," which followed her as she prepared for an art show. But it wasn't until 2019, when Ms. Auder's yoga satires began to get some notice, that she thought she might try to sell the book one last time.
Viva hasn't read the final version. Nonetheless, she is proud of her elder daughter, she said in an interview, for finally getting her story published. Mr. Auder has read the book, and he said he had to pause in his reading to catch his breath as he took in his daughter's experience, marveling, with a bit of guilt, at how she coped with her complicated upbringing and at "her finely chiseled prose expertly laid on paper."
"Don't Call Me Home" is fully cooked, wicked in its humor and often heartbreaking. "I always fear that trying to not be like Viva has made me remote," Ms. Auder writes. One day in family therapy, as she writes, her daughter, Lui, accused her of just that. The session spurs a memory of the night before Ms. Auder's college graduation, when Viva paced the streets of Tivoli, howling like a character in a Greek tragedy as Ms. Auder hid in Mr. Nehéz's closet.
"Daughters!" Viva cried. "If you ever have a daughter, keep trying to have a son. The girls will end up hating you." There was much more, and the performance ended with this kicker: "Did Jesus Christ ask to be crucified?"
Sitting in the therapist's office with her own angry daughter years later, Ms. Auder writes, "I had vowed to never say words like this to my own daughter, but I can't escape the thoughts. Raising daughters is like a crucifixion. Shut up, Viva."
Ms. Auder said she didn't quite know why she had written the memoir. "Maybe it was some storytelling gene," she said, "or the knowledge that there was something both distinctly idiosyncratic and universal about my life with Viva. I wanted to describe the burning love I felt for her and the maddening frustration and fury. As time passed, I began to see our story as a love story. One that falls apart. I see the story, now, as a feminist story. It's about women! Strong women, crazy women, women in love, women in rage, women in despair, birth, desire, sex, single mothers, friendships only women can have, women trying to make art and raise a family at the same time, women trying to do it all and failing. Women enduring ... each other."
Today, there are few traces of the artists and eccentrics who once stalked the Chelsea's halls. There are some notable Viva touches in the recently renovated building, however: A laminated, framed New York Times story from 1993 featuring Viva and Ms. Hoffmann is hanging on a wall, though not in the spot Mr. Bard, the hotel manager, had originally put it. At the time, Viva had angrily marked up the section about herself with a pen because she didn't want Mr. Bard to use her to publicize the place without remunerating her. In the decades since, the pen markings have turned bright pink. And in the Lobby Bar, the fancy new canteen on the ground floor, you can order a Viva Superstar cocktail, a dizzying mix of gin, cachaça and other exotic ingredients, like whey. It is $ 32.
"She was a trailblazer," Ms. Auder said. "Ahead of her time in many respects. Too ahead of her time in the sense that she was considered crazy before she was revered. She was outspoken when being outspoken was not hip. Nude, when nudity was not hip. Raging against the machine before the machine created a platform, the internet, from which to be raged about. On top of all that, she was, and is, a difficult person with no money."
For her part, Ms. Hoffmann, in a telephone interview, described her mother's legacy in terms of what she bequeathed to her daughters.
"Radical truth-telling," she said. "Incredible confidence. A sense of justice. An appreciation of beauty. Empathy. Irreverence. I think my sister and I have both benefited from the ferocity that is Viva."

U.A.W. Will Hold Off Backing Biden: [National Desk]

Full text: A memo by the union's president underscores how some of President Biden's moves to fight climate change could weaken some of his political support.
The United Auto Workers, a politically potent labor union, is planning to withhold its endorsement of President Biden in the early stages of the 2024 race, according to an internal memo from its president to members on Tuesday.
The memo, written by Shawn Fain, the Detroit-based union's president, said the leadership of the United Auto Workers had traveled to Washington last week to meet with Biden administration officials and had expressed "our concerns with the electric vehicle transition" that the president has pursued.
The memo underscores how some of Mr. Biden's boldest moves to fight climate change, which animate his liberal base, could at the same time weaken his political support among another crucial constituency. The U.A.W. has shrunk in size in recent decades, but it still counts about 400,000 active members, with a robust presence in Michigan, a critical battleground state for Democrats.
In April, the Biden administration proposed the nation's most ambitious climate regulations yet, which would ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars are all-electric by 2032 -- up from just 5.8 percent today. The rules, if enacted, could sharply lower planet-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes, the nation's largest source of greenhouse emissions. But they come with costs for autoworkers, because it takes fewer than half the laborers to assemble an all-electric vehicle as it does to build a gasoline-powered car.
In the memo, Mr. Fain provided "talking points" for members about why the union was not immediately lining up behind Mr. Biden, writing that if companies received federal subsidies, then workers "must be compensated with top wages and benefits."
"The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom," the memo reads, referring to electric vehicles. "We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments."
Mr. Fain won the U.A.W. presidency as an insurgent candidate this year, toppling the incumbent, Ray Curry. Mr. Fain promised a more confrontational path ahead of contract talks. In the memo, he notes that 150,000 autoworkers are fighting for a new contract with the so-called Big Three auto companies in September, writing, "We'll stand with whoever stands with our members in that fight."
Labor support is a key part of Mr. Biden's political coalition and his portrayal of himself as a fighter for the middle class.
Within hours of Mr. Biden's formal entry into the 2024 race, a number of top labor unions backed Mr. Biden, including the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Service Employees International Union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
"Several national unions were quick to endorse," Mr. Fain wrote in his memo. "The United Auto Workers is not yet making an endorsement."
Mr. Biden's campaign trumpeted his support from other labor unions in a news release. Notably, Mr. Biden's first public appearance after announcing his re-election campaign last week was addressing a labor conference in the nation's capital.
"I've said many times: Wall Street didn't build America," he told the cheering union crowd last week. "The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class!"
The United Auto Workers, which has historically endorsed Democrats and supported Mr. Biden in 2020, makes clear in the memo that it has no intent of backing the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump. Withholding a formal endorsement for now instead appears to be a bid for leverage or concessions from the administration.
"Another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster," reads Mr. Fain's memo, which was first reported by The Detroit News. "But our members need to see an alternative that delivers real results. We need to get our members organized behind a pro-worker, pro-climate, and pro-democracy political program that can deliver for the working class."
Mr. Biden has sought to accelerate the transition to all-electric vehicles as a centerpiece of his effort to tackle climate change. A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to avert the deadliest effects of a warming planet.
To help reach that goal, Mr. Biden has pushed a fleet of policies designed to promote electric vehicles.
The Biden administration's proposed climate regulations announced in April are designed to add legal teeth to consumer incentives, compelling automakers to manufacture and sell more electric vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency rules, however, are not yet final: They are open for public comment, and could still be weakened or otherwise changed before being completed next year.
As the Biden administration prepared to unveil the new clean car rules last month, officials planned for Michael S. Regan, the head of the E.P.A., to announce the policies in Detroit, surrounded by American-made all-electric vehicles.
But as auto executives and the United Auto Workers learned the details of the proposed regulations, some grew uneasy about publicly supporting it, according to two people familiar with their thinking. No one from the United Auto Workers attended the unveiling, according to the organization's spokesman, although representatives from Ford, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz were there.
And the setting was moved from Detroit to the E.P.A. headquarters in Washington.

A Daughter of a Warhol Superstar Tells Her Story at Last

Full text: Enlarge this image.
PHILADELPHIA — Alexandra Auder was almost born in the lobby of the Chelsea Hotel, then a febrile bohemian enclave on Manhattan’s West 23rd Street, but her mother, Viva, a Warhol superstar, managed to make it to the hospital as the staff egged her on. “A girl! I want a girl!” a bellman declared, helping her into a taxi.
That scene was captured on videotape by Auder’s father, Michel Auder, a French filmmaker who kept his camera running day and night. Alexandra Auder was also the star of her mother’s 1975 book, “The Baby,” which Rolling Stone described as a female rendition of “On the Road,” but better written and funnier.
At 52, Auder has finally pieced together her own version of events. Her decades-in-the-making memoir, “Don’t Call Me Home,” with a title inspired by a Thomas Wolfe novel and a line from a Nico song, began as a roman à clef called “Frogs” that was her senior thesis at Bard College in Red Hook, New York.
She was raised in bohemian mayhem, as her parents careered from film sets and exotic locales to the homes of jet set friends like Roger Vadim and Jane Fonda. Her mother was known for her turns in Warhol’s deadpan soft porn films of the late ’60s and became a darling of talk show hosts. Born Janet Susan Mary Hoffmann, she was christened Viva by Paul Morrissey, the director and cinematographer of many Warhol films, as they headed out to a party thrown by Shelley Winters.
It might have been on “The Dick Cavett Show” that Viva joked that she’d named herself after the paper towel (the company later sent her a carton, as well as a pink dress for her daughter). Her husband was a handsome practitioner of extreme cinéma vérité with a modest heroin habit and a predilection for beautiful women. He and Viva parted ways when Alexandra was 5, after which, as she writes in her memoir, she and her mother fused.
“Don’t Call Me Home,” which comes out Tuesday, is an ode to a vanished world — the feral, slightly squalid world of downtown New York in the 1980s — and to her mercurial, charismatic mother. Viva was given to dressing down cops, taxi drivers, neighbors, badly behaved children, Auder’s boyfriends and Stanley Bard, the aggrieved manager of the Chelsea, when he cornered her for unpaid rent.
Bohemia is not a lucrative state, and mother and daughter survived on welfare, the largesse of friends and family and the meager earnings from Viva’s freelance articles and occasional bit parts in films. There was a tiny windfall after Viva and Auder appeared on “Late Night with David Letterman” in 1983 and Viva asked the audience to send her cash. Letterman, annoyed, cut their segment short while Viva was still yelling out her address. For some time afterward, envelopes containing dollar bills made their way to “Viva Superstar, c/o The Chelsea Hotel.”
“I’m certain that if she and the Dalai Lama were locked in a cell together,” Auder writes of her mother, “and she turned the screw on him, he would crack within the hour. He might even try to kill her because he has been kowtowed to his whole life and never forced to contend with a Viva.”
Growing up with a Viva meant catering to her whims, like inveigling Chelsea staff members into running across the street to the deli for Petit Ecolier chocolate biscuits and sweet-talking them into a loan if Auder couldn’t find any cash. It meant managing Viva’s darkening moods — “Mom, you seem a little nervous. You should go on vacation,” Auder, age about 10, might say, and off Viva would go to Mexico or Argentina. And it meant sometimes avoiding her mother altogether by spending the night with Squat Theater, the collective of exiled Hungarian performers who lived above their performance space in a storefront near the Chelsea.
Viva’s domestic style was haphazard at best and could veer into chaos if left unchecked, so Auder also learned to be an excellent, if slightly disgruntled, housekeeper. When her sister, Gaby, was born — that would be Gaby Hoffmann, the actor who found fame as Kevin Costner’s daughter in “Field of Dreams” — Auder, age 11, took her on as well, parading along 23rd Street with the baby in the English pram favored by her mother. She doted on Gaby and kept a list of her first words: Hot. Penis. Bitch. I love you.
Mother and daughters slept in one room, the girls in bunk beds and Viva in a bed wedged between the bunks and a wall. From a top bunk, Auder could hear her mother flossing her teeth, the swish of her feet and her breathing. Close quarters, indeed.
These days Auder lives far from the Chelsea, in a century-old stone house in Philadelphia with her husband, Nick Nehéz, a filmmaker and artist she met in college, and their two children, Lui and Miko. She is also far from Viva, who resides in Palm Springs, California. Tall and lanky, Auder resembles her father, but her sense of mischief is all her mother’s. She is comedic and expressive, a profane close talker.
She has made a living as a yoga teacher, though she doesn’t really like teaching and has a penchant for skewering the pieties of her profession in Instagram parodies filmed by her husband. She has appeared in videos as a clueless self-care influencer, sometimes wrapped in a shearling rug, hawking tinctures with names like One Per Scent and Abundance, thanking Mercedes-Benz for ferrying her to ayahuasca ceremonies, and browbeating a pair of “students” played by naked American Girl dolls marked up with Sharpies.

“Daughters!” Viva cried. “If you ever have a daughter, keep trying to have a son. The girls will end up hating you.” There was much more, and the performance ended with this kicker: “Did Jesus Christ ask to be crucified?”
Sitting in the therapist’s office with her own angry daughter years later, Auder writes, “I had vowed to never say words like this to my own daughter, but I can’t escape the thoughts. Raising daughters is like a crucifixion. Shut up, Viva.”
Auder said she didn’t quite know why she had written the memoir. “Maybe it was some storytelling gene,” she said, “or the knowledge that there was something both distinctly idiosyncratic and universal about my life with Viva. I wanted to describe the burning love I felt for her and the maddening frustration and fury. As time passed, I began to see our story as a love story. One that falls apart. I see the story, now, as a feminist story. It’s about women! Strong women, crazy women, women in love, women in rage, women in despair, birth, desire, sex, single mothers, friendships only women can have, women trying to make art and raise a family at the same time, women trying to do it all and failing. Women enduring … each other.”
Today, there are few traces of the artists and eccentrics who once stalked the Chelsea’s halls. There are some notable Viva touches in the recently renovated building, however: A laminated, framed New York Times story from 1993 featuring Viva and Hoffmann is hanging on a wall, though not in the spot Bard, the hotel manager, had originally put it.

In the decades since, the pen markings have turned bright pink.

She was outspoken when being outspoken was not hip. Nude, when nudity was not hip. Raging against the machine before the machine created a platform, the internet, from which to be raged about. On top of all that, she was, and is, a difficult person with no money.”
For her part, Hoffmann, in a telephone interview, described her mother’s legacy in terms of what she bequeathed to her daughters.
“Radical truth-telling,” she said. “Incredible confidence. A sense of justice. An appreciation of beauty. Empathy. Irreverence. I think my sister and I have both benefited from the ferocity that is Viva.”

Stretch Limos, Rides to Red Carpets and Proms, Are 'Gone Like the Dodo Bird': [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over a few days in early March, carmakers and limousine company operators gathered at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for an annual convention, where they went to panels and parties and admired shiny new party buses, vans and black sport utility vehicles.
But something was missing.
"There wasn't one stretch limousine on the show floor," said Robert Alexander, president of the National Limousine Association, a trade group. "Not one."
Decades ago, stretch limos were a symbol of affluence, used almost exclusively by the rich and famous. Over time, they became more of a common luxury, booked for children's birthday parties or by teenagers heading to the prom.
These days, it seems as if hardly anyone is riding in a stretch limo. While the limousine name has stuck, the limo industry has shifted to chauffeur services in almost anything but actual stretch limos, which have largely been supplanted by black S.U.V.s, buses and vans.
"The limo business isn't your father's limo business anymore," Mr. Alexander said.
Today, the stretch limo represents less than 1 percent of services offered by limo companies, down from about 10 percent a decade ago, according to the association.
"The stretch limo is -- what's the expression? -- gone like the dodo bird," Mr. Alexander said. "Extinct."
Limo company operators and industry leaders say that the demise of the stretch limo can be attributed to the cumulative effect of a series of blows over several years.
The first, they said, was the Great Recession. Then came the rise of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, and a pair of deadly stretch limo crashes that ushered in new regulations in New York State, one of the industry's most important markets. Over that time, stretch limos gradually fell out of favor, as passengers opted to travel somewhat less conspicuously in sleek sedans or black S.U.V.s.
Horse-Drawn Wagons to Hummer Limos
The birthplace of the stretch limo is believed to have been Fort Smith, Ark. Armbruster Stageway, a coach builder that started off restoring horse-drawn wagons more than 100 years ago, is credited with creating the first combustion engine limousine in the 1920s. By 1985, the company was one of the leading producers of limos in the United States, making about 1,000 a year.
But around that time, many car companies stopped making limos. Specialty coachmakers filled the void by taking a different approach: cutting a sedan in half, inserting a midsection and welding everything together. For about $ 50,000, custom manufacturers promised deluxe results that could include a TV and even a bed in addition to the obligatory well-stocked bar.
As more limos were produced, they became more accessible and began attracting a clientele beyond celebrities and the über-rich. People began booking them for airport trips. A restaurant in New Jersey offered to pick up diners in a limo, drive them to dinner and take them home afterward. And for some suburban teenagers, it became a rite of passage to pile into a stretch limo during prom season, often trying -- with mixed results -- to sneak booze past drivers thrust into the role of reluctant chaperone.
"In the best-case scenario, somebody would use you all day to go to meetings in, let's say, Manhattan," Mr. Alexander said, adding that a driver could then take a client to a hotel to freshen up before whisking the customer back out on the town. "That kind of coincided with kind of the nightlife of the city coming alive in the late '70s and '80s," he said.
Limousine operators like Scott Woodruff, president and chief executive of Majestic Limo & Coach in Des Moines, made adjustments for the rising demand. By the early 2000s, an era when the Hummer limo first appeared and party buses were being tricked out with bench seats, TVs and minibars, stretch limos made up about a quarter of the vehicles in his fleet.
"Every year, you would see the limos get larger and larger," Mr. Woodruff said.
Chuck Cotton, who owns VIP Limo in Oklahoma and has been in the business more than 30 years, said his fleet peaked at 35 stretch limos, six party buses and four Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans, which carry about a dozen people.
Then the housing market collapsed in 2008, setting in motion the longest and sharpest economic downturn since the Great Depression -- and the beginning of the end of the stretch limo.
Recession, Ride Shares and Regulations
The downturn prompted companies to cut spending and shed workers. Demand for stretch limo rides cratered, as unemployment and gas prices soared.
"The market imploded," Mr. Alexander, of the National Limousine Association, said.
The country was still in the throes of the recession when Uber was founded in 2009. Its main competitor, Lyft, arrived in 2012, and together they shook up the taxi industry and also made chauffeured black cars more accessible.
"When they first came on the scene, people -- in particular, in our industry -- really bristled," Mr. Alexander said of the ride-hailing services.
As Uber and Lyft grew, two deadly crashes in New York State highlighted the dangers of stretch limos. One killed four women on Long Island in 2015 and another in 2018 killed 20 people in Schoharie, about 40 miles west of Albany. State lawmakers responded by requiring seatbelts for all passengers and commercial driver's licenses for chauffeurs. The state's transportation commissioner was authorized to impound any stretch limo that failed an inspection.
Changing customer tastes were also a factor in the plummeting demand for stretch limos, according to Jeff Rose, president of Attitude New York, a chauffeured transportation service in Queens.
"When a stretch pulls over, everybody turns around to see who's getting in or getting out," Mr. Rose said. These days his clients prefer the discretion of a black sedan or S.U.V.
The Limo Industry Today
While demand for stretch limos isn't what it was in the 1980s or even the early 2000s, the limo industry is thriving. It just looks different now.
In addition to the shift to sedans and S.U.V.s, the industry is embracing Sprinter vans and party buses. Barbara White, co-owner and chief financial officer of VIP Transportation Group in Orlando, Fla., said that her business sold two of its stretch limos in recent years, replacing one with a Sprinter van. With a fleet that also includes buses, sedans and S.U.V.s, Ms. White's company provides more than 1,000 rides a year, mostly for weddings, she said.
Matthew Daus, a lawyer and a former commissioner and chairman of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, said that buses and vans appeared to be the future of the limo industry.
"They're going to be fancier on the inside, but they're going to probably stay nice and discreet on the outside," Mr. Daus said. "The limousine industry is very resilient. They bounced back from the pandemic, and they are muscling into the motor coach and the charter industry."
But the days of the stretch appear to be nearly over.
Mr. Rose said his company in Queens used to have four stretch limos in a fleet of about 30 vehicles. In the Attitude New York garage today, there are sedans and S.U.V.s, including Lexuses and Cadillac Escalades, but there isn't a single stretch limo. He sold his last one eight years ago.
"And for the two years prior to that," he said, "it was pretty much a paperweight."

Over a few days in early March, carmakers and limousine company operators gathered at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for an annual convention, where they went to panels and parties and admired shiny new party buses, vans and black sport utility vehicles.
But something was missing.
“There wasn’t one stretch limousine on the show floor,” said Robert Alexander, president of the National Limousine Association, a trade group. “Not one.”
Decades ago, stretch limos were a symbol of affluence, used almost exclusively by the rich and famous. Over time, they became more of a common luxury, booked for children’s birthday parties or by teenagers heading to the prom.
These days, it seems as if hardly anyone is riding in a stretch limo. While the limousine name has stuck, the limo industry has shifted to chauffeur services in almost anything but actual stretch limos, which have largely been supplanted by black SUVs, buses and vans.
“The limo business isn’t your father’s limo business anymore,” Alexander said.
Today, the stretch limo represents less than 1% of services offered by limo companies, down from about 10% a decade ago, according to the association.
“The stretch limo is — what’s the expression? — gone like the dodo bird,” Alexander said. “Extinct.”
Limo company operators and industry leaders say that the demise of the stretch limo can be attributed to the cumulative effect of a series of blows over several years.
The first, they said, was the Great Recession. Then came the rise of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, and a pair of deadly stretch limo crashes that ushered in new regulations in New York state, one of the industry’s most important markets. Over that time, stretch limos gradually fell out of favor, as passengers opted to travel somewhat less conspicuously in sleek sedans or black SUVs.

Credits and Debits of E.V. Shopping: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Buying an electric car has become much more complicated because of restrictions on which models qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $ 7,500.
Designed to accelerate the shift to electric cars among other climate goals, the Inflation Reduction Act has in practice made buying such vehicles a lot more complicated.
In August, the law ruled out the full tax credit of $ 7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids assembled outside North America. That may make it harder for consumers to take the financial or psychological leap to buy a battery-powered car.
The Treasury Department further tightened those rules this week by requiring that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in car batteries are sourced from the United States or in countries that are its trade allies -- numbers that will increase over time.
Just 11 electric cars from four automakers -- Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen -- now qualify for the full tax credit; several others can qualify for a partial $ 3,750 credit. The list is expected to grow as more automakers reconfigure their supply chains.
The rules are already driving big changes in the buying and selling of electric cars. Some automakers whose models are no longer eligible are now pushing leased electric cars. That's because the law allows leased vehicles to qualify as commercial vehicles, which the Inflation Reduction Act exempts from the restrictions that apply to cars bought by individuals.
For many car buyers, the availability of the tax credit is critical. Electric vehicle prices have fallen in recent months, but they still cost $ 58,940 on average in March, nearly $ 11,000 more than a typical new car, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Ethan Derner of Portland, Ore., and his fiancée, Lorien Sekora, share two Kia electric cars. Mr. Derner had considered replacing his car with a new model that could drive farther on a charge, but he gave up after realizing that the vehicles he wanted were either too expensive or no more practical than his current car. He has extended the lease on his Kia Soul and is waiting for more affordable models that can qualify for a tax credit.
"The only other model I'm considering now is a Rivian, but that's out of my price range," Mr. Derner said. Rivian's electric luxury models like the R1T pickup truck and R1S S.U.V. are built in Illinois and qualify for a $ 3,750 credit.
"Until I can drive to Seattle and back with no anxiety," Mr. Derner added, "I'm not going to buy a new E.V. outright."
His experience is common. About 80 percent of people who were shopping for an electric vehicle recently surveyed by Cars.com said tax credits played a big role in their decision to buy an electric car and the vehicle they planned to buy.
Many industry experts and consumers have praised the multipronged mission of the law to curb greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs in the United States and blunt China's dominance in batteries and mineral processing. Since President Biden took office, automakers, battery and other companies have announced plans to spend more than $ 100 billion to electrify the U.S. auto industry.
Yet the rules could hinder the goal of getting more people to buy electric vehicles -- at least for the next few years.
"They made it complex for a reason, but in the meantime it's creating all kinds of chaos for consumers," said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "In the short term, it's absolutely going to hurt the companies that aren't eligible and help the companies that are."
The reshuffled credits appear to deal an especially tough hand to Hyundai Motor, which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands.
Models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have won industry accolades and impressed buyers with attractive designs and some of the fastest charging times of any electric cars. But they are built in South Korea and, thus, not eligible for any federal tax breaks.
Even as sales of all Hyundai and Kia cars jumped in the first three months of the year, the brands' electric vehicle sales fell more than 25 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric car sales on the whole soared to another record in the first quarter, on a pace to top one million cars in 2023, and now account for 7.2 percent of all new cars sold.
The credit rules have been changing fast. Last month, Genesis' first American-built model, the Electrified GV70 sport utility vehicle, began rolling off a Hyundai line in Alabama after 16 hours of assembly. Genesis executives had hoped that the model could qualify for a credit, but the car did not meet the tougher rules the Biden administration released this week.
To make up for the loss of the tax breaks, Hyundai and other automakers are trying to lure buyers through leases. Under the administration's broad interpretations of the law, leased electric cars are eligible for tax credits even if they are made overseas and are not subjected to the government's rules on sourcing requirements for battery components and minerals, household income caps and vehicle price thresholds.
Car dealers can pass along the commercial credit to consumers by lowering the price of the car in lease transactions, which could reduce monthly payments. Under the rules of thumb for auto financing, applying the full $ 7,500 credit to a lease could save consumers about $ 225 per month over three years, or $ 125 per month over five years, said Russell Datz, a spokesman for Volvo.
Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, Sweden, sells two electric models in the United States that are made at a factory in Belgium and do not qualify for federal tax credits. The automaker will start assembling a new S.U.V., the EX90, at its factory in South Carolina this year.
Consumers are getting the money-saving message. In September, after the law's passage, just 7 percent of consumers leased an electric vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. By March, leases accounted for 34 percent of the electric car market.
Gary Murphy, a retired educator in Castle Rock, Colo., leased an Ioniq 5 in February from a dealer that learned of the commercial credit the day before.
"We had no plans to lease a car," Mr. Murphy said. "But when they confirmed you can get $ 7,500 on a lease, or nothing to buy, that's too big an incentive to pass up."
Before tracking down the Ioniq 5, he waited for months for three different electric models, which were in short supply. When cars were available, many dealers demanded several thousand dollars more than manufacturers' suggested retail prices.
"You can get the credit, but you can't get the car," Mr. Murphy said.
The use of credits for leased vehicles has angered some automakers and lawmakers who say it subverts the intent of Congress. Consumers can lease any electric vehicle for the $ 7,500 credit. For example, a couple making more than $ 300,000 -- the income limit for married people for the tax credit -- can lease a $ 148,000 Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS and claim a $ 7,500 credit even though the car is made in Germany and far exceeds the $ 55,000 price cap for electric sedans to qualify for the credit.
Treasury officials have said their decision to allow a tax credit for leased cars is legally sound. The Inflation Reduction Act exempted commercial vehicles from the restrictions to encourage rental car companies, local governments and other owners of car and truck fleets to buy electric vehicles.
Of course, many consumers prefer buying and owning cars, in part to avoid lease limits on how much they can drive and penalties for excessive wear and tear.
José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, insists the loss of buyer credits puts his brands at a huge marketplace disadvantage. But the chairman of Hyundai's national dealer council, Kevin Reilly, said models like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would remain competitive despite their financial handicap.
The Ioniq 6, which recently went on sale, is the longest-range and most energy-efficient mass-market electric car in the United States. It can be driven up to 361 miles on a full charge and gets the equivalent of 140 miles to the gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
"I think our customers will evaluate the full landscape, not just whether an E.V. qualifies for credit," said Mr. Reilly, the owner and president of Alexandria Hyundai in Virginia.
Mr. Reilly said leasing offered other advantages. People who are anxious about switching to battery-powered cars can try one without a long-term commitment or worrying about resale value. And as electric vehicle technology advances and more affordable models hit the market, customers can easily upgrade when their lease is up.
Still, some car buyers said they would buy only electric cars eligible for tax credits because they supported the aims of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Jonathan Quarles, an entrepreneur in Detroit, said he spent more than $ 150 per week to fill up a Ford Expedition to ferry his three daughters around town. He is considering replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is eligible for a $ 3,750 federal tax credit. After watching manufacturing jobs leave the country for decades, he said, he has little sympathy for automakers whose cars did not qualify for credits.
"My perspective is," he said, "you should have been building those factories way before the credit."

Since President Joe Biden took office, automakers, battery and other companies have announced plans to spend more than $100 billion to electrify the U.S. auto industry.
Yet the rules could hinder the goal of getting more people to buy electric vehicles — at least for the next few years.
“They made it complex for a reason, but in the meantime, it’s creating all kinds of chaos for consumers,” said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. “In the short term, it’s absolutely going to hurt the companies that aren’t eligible and help the companies that are.”
The reshuffled credits appear to deal an especially tough hand to Hyundai Motor, which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands.
Models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have won industry accolades and impressed buyers with attractive designs and some of the fastest charging times of any electric cars. But they are built in South Korea and, thus, not eligible for any federal tax breaks.
Even as sales of all Hyundai and Kia cars jumped in the first three months of the year, the brands’ electric vehicle sales fell more than 25%, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric car sales on the whole soared to another record in the first quarter, on a pace to top 1 million cars in 2023, and now account for 7.2% of all new cars sold.
The credit rules have been changing fast. Last month, Genesis’ first American-built model, the Electrified GV70 sport utility vehicle, began rolling off a Hyundai line in Alabama after 16 hours of assembly. Genesis executives had hoped that the model could qualify for a credit, but the car did not meet the tougher rules the Biden administration released this week.
To make up for the loss of the tax breaks, Hyundai and other automakers are trying to lure buyers through leases. Under the administration’s broad interpretations of the law, leased electric cars are eligible for tax credits even if they are made overseas and are not subjected to the government’s rules on sourcing requirements for battery components and minerals, household income caps and vehicle price thresholds.
Car dealers can pass along the commercial credit to consumers by lowering the price of the car in lease transactions, which could reduce monthly payments. Under the rules of thumb for auto financing, applying the full $7,500 credit to a lease could save consumers about $225 per month over three years, or $125 per month over five years, said Russell Datz, a spokesperson for Volvo.
Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, Sweden, sells two electric models in the United States that are made at a factory in Belgium and do not qualify for federal tax credits. The automaker will start assembling a new SUV, the EX90, at its factory in South Carolina this year.
Consumers are getting the money-saving message. In September, after the law’s passage, just 7% of consumers leased an electric vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. By March, leases accounted for 34% of the electric car market.
Gary Murphy, a retired educator in Castle Rock, Colorado, leased an Ioniq 5 in February from a dealer that learned of the commercial credit the day before.
“We had no plans to lease a car,” Murphy said. “But when they confirmed you can get $7,500 on a lease, or nothing to buy, that’s too big an incentive to pass up.”
Before tracking down the Ioniq 5, he waited for months for three different electric models, which were in short supply. When cars were available, many dealers demanded several thousand dollars more than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices.
“You can get the credit, but you can’t get the car,” Murphy said.
The use of credits for leased vehicles has angered some automakers and lawmakers who say it subverts the intent of Congress. Consumers can lease any electric vehicle for the $7,500 credit. For example, a couple making more than $300,000 — the income limit for married people for the tax credit — can lease a $148,000 Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS and claim a $7,500 credit even though the car is made in Germany and far exceeds the $55,000 price cap for electric sedans to qualify for the credit.
Treasury officials have said their decision to allow a tax credit for leased cars is legally sound. The Inflation Reduction Act exempted commercial vehicles from the restrictions to encourage rental car companies, local governments and other owners of car and truck fleets to buy electric vehicles.
Of course, many consumers prefer buying and owning cars, in part to avoid lease limits on how much they can drive and penalties for excessive wear and tear.
José Muñoz, the CEO of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, insists the loss of buyer credits puts his brands at a huge marketplace disadvantage. But the chair of Hyundai’s national dealer council, Kevin Reilly, said models like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would remain competitive despite their financial handicap.
The Ioniq 6, which recently went on sale, is the longest-range and most energy-efficient mass-market electric car in the United States. It can be driven up to 361 miles on a full charge and gets the equivalent of 140 miles to the gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I think our customers will evaluate the full landscape, not just whether an EV qualifies for credit,” said Reilly, the owner and president of Alexandria Hyundai in Virginia.
Reilly said leasing offered other advantages. People who are anxious about switching to battery-powered cars can try one without a long-term commitment or worrying about resale value. And as electric vehicle technology advances and more affordable models hit the market, customers can easily upgrade when their lease is up.
Still, some car buyers said they would buy only electric cars eligible for tax credits because they supported the aims of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Jonathan Quarles, an entrepreneur in Detroit, said he spent more than $150 per week to fill up a Ford Expedition to ferry his three daughters around town. He is considering replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is eligible for a $3,750 federal tax credit. After watching manufacturing jobs leave the country for decades, he said, he has little sympathy for automakers whose cars did not qualify for credits.
“My perspective is,” he said, “you should have been building those factories way before the credit.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The photographer Adali Schell, 21, grew up in Los Angeles and spent last summer documenting the members of his creative community in their cars. In interviews last fall, they spoke about the joy of getting behind the wheel, creating a space of safety and curiosity for themselves and their fears about the future -- including the increasingly damaging effects of climate change.
Finding a place to belong "feels so scarce" in Los Angeles, Schell said. But in the confines of an old Mercedes-Benz (now powered by vegetable oil), a former taxi cab, a beat-up Volvo and a "mom" car, this group of artists and students found "a stronger sense of self and sense of security."
"It's hard to find a home away from home, especially if you're trying to find yourself or if you're in a toxic living situation or whatever the situation might be," Schell said. "The car is a remedy for a lot of those things. It's both a thing that can take you somewhere and a thing that could really protect you."
Driving around on her own for the first time was exhilarating, said Keni Titus, 21. "It's so interesting to be in charge, like, oh my God, if we want to go through the drive-through, we can go. You want to smoke a cigarette in my car? You can smoke a cigarette in my car.
"That is the first taste of adulthood and ultimate freedom."
Kali Flanagan, 18, just got his license a few months ago. "I think a lot of people my age feel a lot of pent-up energy," he said. "For one thing, the world is just overstimulating, especially with technology.
"It's really hard nowadays, especially with social media. Everything is about branding yourself."
The car is his escape pod -- a place of safety and a doorway to endless possibilities. "There's this sense of freedom and lack of supervision, and then the actual speed that you're going with the windows down and the loud music and the collection of your friends."
With the freedom of the road comes a freedom of choice and the joy of hitting play on your favorite song. Just as taste and smell can evoke certain memories, the soundtrack of driving around with friends points to a specific time and feeling.
Kerry Parker, 15, and Pilot Lee, 19, can spend hours driving around the city with no destination in mind, blasting Thievery Corporation, Radiohead and Aphex Twin and grooving on the same wavelength. "It doesn't matter where you are," Parker said. "It's just the company."
For Ankha Cros-Roig, 20, the car soundtrack includes "White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane. Or, if she really wants to get the party going, "Moln O' Rök" by Snövit & Greymane. Access to a car is not a privilege she takes for granted. "Growing up in L.A., it's such a big city and the public transportation is so terrible. Getting a car I felt like I could actually do anything and go anywhere."
Titus wrote a song about what it's like to drive around in her friend Victoria's old taxi. "How much do we owe you to ride along?" she sings. "Heads hang out the window as we're singing our favorite song."
The friends were denied so many other typical high-school experiences by the pandemic. But driving around together, Parker said, "you realize you're not alone."
Despite a heavy few years, these friends and artists see hope on the horizon. They are hyper-conscious of the implications of finding joy in a car in a time of climate crisis, and worried about the slow march of progress. But they are energized by the possibilities ahead -- for each other, for the world -- and determined not to take these few magical years together for granted.
Titus describes herself as "anxious and excited" about the future. The two emotions "breathe the same air."
The fear of letting her youth -- these fleeting years -- slip through her fingers is ever-present. "I know that sounds ridiculous because I'm only 21. I have friends I love and the rest will find me. Spending time with those people feels like the main event and the rest are empty spaces."
For Flanagan, "connection and community is hard for me to find in a sense that it's actually truly fulfilling," he said. "Everything is about watering yourself down to something that other people can swallow."
But in the car, with the people who see him as his whole self, he grabs hold of these moments of belonging and trust.
"I want to hang on to this as long as possible."

Full text: Adali Schell has been in the back of cars taking pictures since he was in third grade.
Growing up in Los Angeles, Adali, now 21, carried around his iPod Touch "photographing, obsessively," anywhere his eye landed -- billboards, cars, people, dogs. "It was just this very compulsive practice for a long time," he said.
When he was 13, his father showed him a documentary on the pioneering street photographer Vivian Maier. The next day he used his bar mitzvah money to buy a DSLR camera and began photographing his hometown, a subject that continues to fascinate him.
"The way that I have surrendered my life into the camera was not always in an explorative or adventurous way," he said. Much of his work is focused on documenting his family and friends, whom he calls "the closest issues in my life."
This remained true when the country went into lockdown in early 2020. In his old Mercedes Benz, Adali drove around Los Angeles, photographing the city and his friends. What began as a "big Covid documentation" of young people during the pandemic turned into a project much more limited in scope: the freedom of a first car, an object that takes you from place to place but also "promotes really interesting unapologetic behavior."

Companies In Germany Strengthen Ties to China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Some are expanding in China, reluctant to leave a huge market they need to finance operations back home.
As Washington seeks to throttle economic ties with Beijing, two powerful engines of the German economy, Volkswagen and the chemical company BASF, are broadening their huge Chinese investments.
Volkswagen, which has more than 40 plants in China, announced a new effort to tailor models to Chinese customers' wishes, with features like in-dash karaoke machines, and will invest billions in local partnerships and production sites. It's part of a theme unveiled by the German automaker last year: "In China for China."
BASF, with 30 production facilities in China, is pushing ahead with plans to spend 10 billion euros ( $ 10.9 billion) on a new chemical production complex that would rival in size its massive headquarters complex in Ludwigshafen, which covers about four square miles.
Throughout Germany, executives are aware such investments run contrary to efforts by the United States to isolate China economically. They counter that revenue from China is essential for their businesses to thrive and grow in Europe.
Martin Brudermüller, BASF's chief executive, said earnings from China allowed the company to effectively offset losses from Europe's high energy costs and stringent environmental rules.
"Without the business in China, the necessary restructuring here would not be so possible," Mr. Brudermüller told reporters at his company's annual earnings conference in February. "Name me just one investment in Europe where we could make money."
Executives at Volkswagen privately concede the automaker is in a similar quandary. High energy and labor costs have left the company heavily reliant on sales from China to help underwrite operations in Europe.
Now ever-closer business ties are coming under scrutiny in Berlin. For months, at the urging of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a policy proposal has been making the rounds of German ministries aiming to reset the country's relationship with China, its largest trade partner. The aim is to strike a balance between diversifying Germany's ties throughout Asia to avoid dependence on Chinese imports, while acknowledging the importance of doing business with China.
The Biden administration has pledged to make the United States more competitive with China by expanding American infrastructure and manufacturing, rather than negotiating new trade deals. German lawmakers and business leaders have made clear that their relationship with China is more nuanced: open to vigorous trade while trying to diversify into other Asian markets.
It is a policy being developed after a bruising year when Russia shut down natural gas shipments to Germany, a move that reminded lawmakers of the costs of relying on autocratic nations for materials essential to its industrial backbone. In the case of China, a big problem is Germany's dependence on its imports.
Germany depends on China to provide essential technology products, including mobile phones and LEDs, as well as raw materials, including lithium and rare earth elements. These are critical to Germany's plans to make a transition to cleaner energy and transportation.
Such a reliance must be carefully considered as Germany thinks strategically about its future dealings with China, said Katrin Kamin, a director of the Kiel Initiative in Geopolitics and Economics. Reducing its ties anytime soon is not a reasonable option.
"Germany will not be able to simply relax its relations with China in the short term," Ms. Kamin said. "The dependencies are too great for that."
The European Union has had a bumpier relationship with China. A breakthrough trade and investment deal between the bloc and China, a product of years of talks that was approved in 2020, was shelved less than a year later, after Beijing imposed sanctions on E.U. lawmakers for criticizing China's treatment of its Uyghur population. The deal would have made it easier for companies to operate on one another's territory.
Last week, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, traveled to Beijing with President Emmanuel Macron of France as part of an effort to "rebalance" economic ties with China. She called for the revival of talks about trade, but pointed out stumbling blocks like the support China offers its domestic manufacturers and the restrictions it places on foreign companies.
"China is a crucial trade partner, but E.U. businesses face many discriminatory hurdles," Ms. von der Leyen said after meetings with organizations in Beijing. "European companies have so much to offer China. But they need a level playing field to invest and provide their goods and services."
She told reporters that the stalled trade deal was not discussed in talks with China's leader, Xi Jinping, during the trip.
With foreign trade sales of €297.9 billion last year, China has been Germany's biggest trading partner for seven years in a row. But Germany's trade deficit with China has grown increasingly lopsided, a trend that worsened during the supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, imports from China expanded by a third, to €191 billion, while exports grew only 3 percent, to €107 billion.
One area where Germany has long dominated ties with China is the automobile industry. German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, sell roughly a third of all vehicles they produce in China -- exceeding sales in all of Western Europe. But recent data shows that Germans appear to be losing their grip on the Chinese market, especially as the popularity of domestically produced electric vehicles surges.
Auto insurance registration records show that only 2.4 percent of all electric vehicles sold in China last year were made by Volkswagen, while BMW and Mercedes failed to crack even 1 percent, according to the German business daily Handelsblatt. By comparison, German brands continue to dominate the Chinese market for combustion engine vehicles, but their popularity is giving way to E.V.s.
Perhaps ominously, Chinese electric brands, such as BYD and Nio, are entering the German market, posing a threat to German automakers on their home territory.
In a clear sign of his priorities, within months of taking over as the chief executive of Volkswagen in September, Oliver Blume spent weeks touring China and returned vowing to strengthen his company's partnerships there.
"We have to cooperate much more closely with our local partners in order to listen to the customers in the Chinese region," Mr. Blume told reporters at the company's annual earning meeting last month. "This will be part of a strategy for 2030."
A study by the Kiel Institute showed that decoupling from China would be very costly for all of Europe, but especially Germany, given the strength of its economic ties. Calculations by the institute, based on gross domestic product from 2019, showed that Germany could lose income worth more than €131 billion. And it could be even more if China retaliated.
Berlin would like to avoid another round of the upheaval it experienced after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to an energy war that cost Germany its affordable supply of natural gas. That will mean continuing to balance economic interests with security concerns, Jörg Kukies, an economic adviser to Mr. Scholz, told a gathering of German and American trade leaders.
"We want to have a positive approach to China," Mr. Kukies said. "Not an anti-China approach."

“China is a crucial trade partner, but EU businesses face many discriminatory hurdles,” von der Leyen said after meetings with organizations in Beijing. “European companies have so much to offer China. But they need a level playing field to invest and provide their goods and services.”
She told reporters that the stalled trade deal was not discussed in talks with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, during the trip.
With foreign trade sales of 297.9 billion euros last year, China has been Germany’s biggest trading partner for seven years in a row. But Germany’s trade deficit with China has grown increasingly lopsided, a trend that worsened during the supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, imports from China expanded by a third, to 191 billion euros, while exports grew only 3%, to 107 billion euros.
One area where Germany has long dominated ties with China is the automobile industry. German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, sell roughly a third of all vehicles they produce in China — exceeding sales in all of Western Europe. But recent data shows that Germans appear to be losing their grip on the Chinese market, especially as the popularity of domestically produced electric vehicles surges.
Auto insurance registration records show that only 2.4% of all electric vehicles sold in China last year were made by Volkswagen, while BMW and Mercedes failed to crack even 1%, according to the German business daily Handelsblatt. By comparison, German brands continue to dominate the Chinese market for combustion engine vehicles, but their popularity is giving way to EVs.
Perhaps ominously, Chinese electric brands, such as BYD and Nio, are entering the German market, posing a threat to German automakers on their home territory.
In a clear sign of his priorities, within months of taking over as CEO of Volkswagen in September, Oliver Blume spent weeks touring China and returned vowing to strengthen his company’s partnerships there.
“We have to cooperate much more closely with our local partners in order to listen to the customers in the Chinese region,” Blume told reporters at the company’s annual earning meeting last month. “This will be part of a strategy for 2030.”
A study by the Kiel Institute showed that decoupling from China would be very costly for all of Europe, but especially Germany, given the strength of its economic ties. Calculations by the institute, based on gross domestic product from 2019, showed that Germany could lose income worth more than 131 billion euros. And it could be even more if China retaliated.
Berlin would like to avoid another round of the upheaval it experienced after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to an energy war that cost Germany its affordable supply of natural gas. That will mean continuing to balance economic interests with security concerns, Jörg Kukies, an economic adviser to Scholz, told a gathering of German and U.S. trade leaders.
“We want to have a positive approach to China,” Kukies said. “Not an anti-China approach.”

Full text: As luxury cars become rolling supercomputers, designers are wondering how big is too big.
From pocket-stretching smartphones to wall-hogging TVs, Americans have often asked: How much screen is too much?
The question has come to today's gadget-stuffed cars, whose increasingly colossal screens are splitting opinions among designers, car buyers and industry critics. These do-it-all touch screens, the nerve centers of many new cars, have sparked a backlash because of their size, as well as the clunky interfaces that may take eyes off the road.
"I think we've reached Peak Screen," said Klaus Busse, Maserati's head of design, who previously led design for Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia. "Screens have their right of existence -- they do a lot of things better than physical switches. It's just been pushed a little too far."
Beyond having ergonomic and safety concerns, some luxury designers object on aesthetic grounds. To them, screens just aren't sexy or luxurious.
"When flat screens showed up, the-bigger-the-better was the trend," said Kai Langer, head of design for BMW i, the automaker's electric division. "But 'bigger' isn't always the richest."
Screens are now integral to most modern cars, which are more or less rolling supercomputers, running up to 14 times more code than a Boeing 787. And designers must keep in mind the demands of car owners who expect that their Apple or Android smartphones will hook up flawlessly.
"Steve Jobs changed the world, and now mankind touches a screen," said Gorden Wagener, the chief designer for Mercedes-Benz. "That fundamentally changes the car as well. The car needs a good interface, not just a wiper switch and turn indicator."
When Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Model S in 2009, the command center, with its 17-inch LCD touch screen, seemed nearly as game-changing as the car itself. And in giving drivers digital control of automotive functions, Tesla was able to avoid the expense of engineering, wiring and building a cabin full of pricey analog switches, knobs and gauges -- or having to buy them from another automaker or supplier.
In Tesla's bare-bones Model 3 and Model Y especially, one might suspect that interior designers worked overtime on their ingenious screens and then called it a day. A number of Tesla's competitors mimicked the cabins' austere, vaguely sci-fi vibe.
The creators of later electric vehicles -- including BMW's futuristic yet sumptuous iX and the Kia EV6 -- came up with warmer car interiors better suited to drivers who may not want to feel as if they are spending hours inside the mainframe from "Tron." Some designers are even ditching that most played-out of E.V. tropes, the Mac-like monochromes of gray-silver-white.
With its expanded touch screen, Tesla also spurred an arms race measured in inches. Ford stuffed a 15.5-inch screen into its Mustang Mach-e and F-150 Lightning E.V.s. The start-up Rivian has installed a 16-inch display in the R1T and R1S models. Another California company, Lucid, created a 34-inch, curved-glass screen for the Air sedan.
And then there is the "Hyperscreen," from Mercedes-Benz.
Powered by eight processors, framed under a sculptural slab of double-coated glass, the Hyperscreen (actually three screens that appear as one) spreads 56 inches of digital interface across the dashboard. Augmented-reality navigation generates virtual street signs and directional guides over the pavement in a real-time camera view. Almost magically, virtual address numbers hover over homes and businesses as you approach a destination.
Yet the Hyperscreen doesn't always work as elegantly as it looks -- especially when drivers are, well, driving. Issues include fussy thumb-pad controls on the steering wheel and moments of hair-pulling confusion, especially for customers who grew up with predigital rides. Mr. Wagener said that Mercedes intentionally launched its Hyperscreen in its electric vehicles to aim it at tech-savvy customers.
BMW is no stranger to screens, having ushered in iDrive more than 20 years ago on the 7-Series sedan. That digital operating system, with a now-quaint 6.5-inch screen atop the dashboard, infuriated many drivers because it was so hard to use. But as BMW refined it over the years, rival car companies adopted similar systems.
The i7 sedan, a new electric model from BMW, wraps a curved screen around the driver. The back of the car offers a 31-inch, fold-down theater touch screen, with 5G connectivity and Amazon Fire for streaming. Another 5.5-inch screen nestles into each rear armrest.
At the annual CES in Las Vegas in January, BMW threw down that gauntlet by going well beyond the touch screen. In the iVision Dee, a concept sedan that previews a range of BMW "Neue Klasse" E.V.s -- the first scheduled to arrive in 2025 -- the windshield itself takes the place of a dashboard touch screen.
"Let's use the biggest display we already have in a car, which is the windshield," Mr. Langer, the BMW design chief, said.
The augmented-reality windshield allows for "Minority Report"-style projections of traditional gauges (speedometer; temperature settings; audio displays) and social-and-streaming content. The system, which BMW will call Panoramic Vision on showroom models, greatly expands the head-up displays that project content into the field of view, allowing drivers to check the controls without looking away from the road.
For those leery of astral projections blocking their view of I-95, Mr. Langer said that drivers could choose any display level. A "mixed reality slider" can limit traditional information, such as a speedometer, to a thin strip of lower windshield, where today's head-up displays already operate. Drivers more at ease with digital projections can fill more of the windshield glass with content. When the car isn't moving, including during charging stops, passengers may eventually use the entire windshield like a virtual drive-in for movies, games, Zoom meetings or trips to the metaverse.
At the convention in Las Vegas, the BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said he was convinced that regulators would eventually ban large dashboard screens because of safety concerns. "If you have to look down to operate your car, we think it's a big mistake," he told Automotive News Europe.
Mr. Langer noted that prominent screens do not appear in the pages of high-end shelter or architectural magazines. "None of our consumers would want to cover their living room in screens," he said. "They want their Eames chair or Nelson clock. And we want our customers to feel at home."
And if touch screens shrink or even disappear from cars' cabins, designers will be free to reclaim the interiors for something more aesthetically pleasing. "A touch screen doesn't speak to our senses," Mr. Langer said. "We're made to touch fabrics and sense different surfaces; that's what makes us human."
Some of the iVision Dee's fanciful tech -- including a chameleon-like body that can instantly change to one of 32 colors -- may be ditched or watered down in production versions. Yet BMW vows the panoramic display is bound for showrooms.
Mercedes-Benz is skeptical. While it offers head-up displays, it is convinced that windshield projections "are light-years behind the quality and resolution you can achieve on a screen," Mr. Wagener said.
"It's certainly an innovative approach," he continued. "But we've tried it, and it's disturbing or disorienting to have all that in your viewing area."
Maserati is steering a middle course with its GranTurismo. Its interior includes a pair of screens that don't draw attention to themselves.
"We don't want a screen to be the main protagonist," Mr. Busse, the Maserati design chief, said.
In his view, the car is a refuge from the digital world and its pressures.
"For us," he said, "it's still about the driving experience -- to enjoy this beautiful machine and the countryside where you're operating it."

If It's Domestic and Electric, China's Car Buyers Want to Own It: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Domestic companies are now selling more vehicles than their multinational rivals, which have failed to keep up with Chinese consumers' demand for electric cars and S.U.V.s.
For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $ 290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $ 70,000 sport utility vehicle designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
"If you're sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury," said Mr. Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city's auto show next Tuesday. The country is now the world's largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China's giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China's car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country's dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells -- at home and abroad -- most of the world's electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars' electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80 percent of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
"Multinationals' market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment," said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 -- standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers -- many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies' joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and E.V.s have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold one million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany's Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. G.M. would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which G.M. has a 44 percent stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $ 4,800 to $ 21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China's domestic car companies rose to 52 percent in the last quarter of 2022, from 47 percent the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3 percent of the car market, up from 2.1 percent four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China's leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. G.M. plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
"The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and G.M. had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Mr. Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
"They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones," he said. "They don't even seem to be in the same age."
Car fashions change quickly in China. Mr. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 sport utility vehicle.
Unlike most large S.U.V.s on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle's hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Mr. Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the S.U.V. for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of "zero Covid" quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China's many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it's Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China. "You want to be closer to them -- the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles," he said. "Foreign automakers don't have the same halo now."

Unlike most large SUVs on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle’s hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the SUV for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of “zero COVID” quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China’s many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it’s Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former CEO of Chrysler China.
“You want to be closer to them — the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles,” he said. “Foreign automakers don’t have the same halo now.”

WASHINGTON — Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country’s transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8% of new cars and less than 2% of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Joe Biden has promised to cut the nation’s emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means that carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $49,507 compared with $61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what’s known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exist.
“This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades,” said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. “Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently.”
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes EVs make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up EV production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than 2 million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are “high, if not very high,” for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, “because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure.”
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. “The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile,” Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.
Manufacturers are funding their electric vehicle production now from substantial profits on their gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles. But maintaining profitability as they produce more electric vehicles and fewer gas-powered models will be a challenge, experts say.
GM has said it is not yet making money on its electric vehicles, and Ford recently said its electric division was set to lose $3 billion this year. Both companies hope to turn the corner as they ramp up production of electric models but are also trying to cut costs now, especially in view of the uncertain economy.
GM is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its workforce.
“Getting to 50, 60% EVs is certainly possible,” said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “But this isn’t going to be easy. Not at all.”
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
“We’re making sales to early adopters and easy adopters, but we need to get beyond them,” said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. “We have a long way to go."
The most basic hurdle is price.
The federal government will offer buyers up to $7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle for the next decade, depending on how much of the vehicle was made in the United States. But of the 91 unique electric vehicle models now on the market in the country, fewer than 40 qualify for the tax credits, Bozzella said.
Drivers are also worried about charging electric vehicles. There are currently 130,000 public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the White House. Under the 2021 infrastructure law, the government will spend $7.5 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways. But a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need more than 2 million public charging stations by 2030, in addition to private home and garage chargers.
Doug Freeman, an insurance executive in Amesbury, Massachusetts, is an obvious customer for an electric vehicle. He has a 140-mile round-trip commute to work, and currently drives a Chevrolet Volt hybrid. “For me, the green side isn’t No. 1 on the priority list, but the savings on fuel from an electric vehicle would be a lot more than for the average consumer,” he said.
But the model he covets, the Kia EV6, is not made in the United States and doesn’t qualify for the $7,500 tax credit. “Without the credit, it’s $50,000 to $54,000,” Freeman said. “I’ve never paid more than about $33,000 for a car.”
Electric vehicle makers are making use of one way to win over consumers: rentals. In 2021, car rental company Hertz bought 100,000 Teslas, making EVs 20% of its fleet. Most other major car rental companies are also adding electric vehicles to their fleets.
“Rental cars are an excellent way to move EVs from niche to mainstream,” said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. “It offers consumers a way to test-drive electric vehicles for a few days, see if they like them, see how they feel about range anxiety,” he said.
By purchasing American-made electric vehicles such as Teslas, the rental companies receive $7,500 in tax credits per car. And the Biden administration has made it easier for the rental companies to resell the cars after a few years: Buyers can receive up to $4,000 in tax credits for the used electric cars.
“Through the incentives and the new laws, the administration has put in place a lot of policies to help automakers get where this regulation says they need to go,” Brinley of S&P Global said.
Even if companies can churn out affordable electric vehicles at a fast pace, and consumers get over range anxiety, the proposed regulations are certain to be hit with legal challenges or be subject to shifting politics.
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, called the regulations “a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on.”
“As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains,” Sommers said.
President Donald Trump relished rolling back the auto pollution regulations enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. A future president could do the same to the Biden regulations.
A group of Republican attorneys general, many of them from oil-producing states, has already challenged several of the Biden administration’s climate polices, none of which are as ambitious as the proposed auto pollution regulations.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia suggested Wednesday that the group would fight the newest proposals.
Steven G. Bradbury, who served as the chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration, said the regulations would amount to government overreach.
“They are using this established, long-standing statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal: the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles,” said Bradbury, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. “This is clearly driven by the president’s directive to achieve these results. I don’t think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the uses of statutes in this way.”
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, who also served as a climate adviser to Obama, argued that the Clean Air Act has been used successfully for years to compel polluting industries to invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.
“All of that is part of the normal course of how EPA has set standards,” she said.
But she conceded that it may not be seen that way by the current Supreme Court, consisting of six judges appointed by Republican presidents, including three named to the court by Trump.
“It is a court that is very unsympathetic to regulation of any kind, and particularly hostile to the EPA,” Freeman said.

American's So-So Outlook Sends Stocks Tumbling
Airline stocks tumbled Wednesday after American Airlines issued a lackluster outlook that amplified fears that travel demand, which has surged for the last year, could be slowing amid inflation and economic uncertainty. American said that it expected to report a small profit for the first quarter, but one that could easily be below Wall Street expectations. American indicated that demand is still about as strong as it predicted in January, but the staythe-course update came as analysts cautioned investors about a slowdown in travel bookings. Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora said this week that his bank's data showed that airline bookings have slowed since mid-March, "and we have become a bit more cautious on 2Q23 revenues." He lowered second-quarter revenue estimates for the big airlines by up to 2 percent. American said that it expected to earn between a penny and 5 cents per share for the most recent quarter.

Mercedes Sales Rise On Strength of E.V.s
Mercedes-Benz sales rose moderately in the first quarter, boosted by electric vehicles and premium cars, the German carmaker said on Wednesday. Worldwide sales increased 3 percent to 503,500 vehicles, with Europe, at 8 percent, posting the strongest growth. E.V.s were the main growth driver in the quarter, with sales almost doubling to 51,600 units. The top-end segment also demonstrated solid growth of 18 percent, reaching 91,800 for the period. Britta Seeger, a Mercedes board member, said both segments posted strong results "despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, economic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainties." Sales in the Mercedes-Benz Vans division grew 12 percent in the quarter, reaching 98,900, its best first-quarter result ever. Earlier on Wednesday, Swedish peer Volvo reported record firstquarter profits in a sign the company had begun to overcome bottlenecks and inflation that hampered the industry. REUTERS

Intel to Work With Arm On Chip Compatibility
Intel's chip contract manufacturing division will work with the British-based chip designer Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories, Intel said on Wednesday. Once the biggest name in chips known as central processing units, Intel has seen its technological manufacturing edge blunted by rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world leader whose customers include Apple. Intel's turnaround strategy hinges in part on opening its factories to other chip companies, particularly those in mobile phones. It has said companies like Qualcomm were planning to use its factories for chip designs. Arm, owned by the Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group, plans to go public later this year. It is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies. REUTERS

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Wednesday proposed the nation’s most ambitious climate regulations to date, two plans designed to ensure two-thirds of new passenger cars and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032.
The new rules would require nothing short of a revolution in the U.S. auto industry, a moment in some ways as significant as the June morning in 1896 when Henry Ford took his “horseless carriage” for a test run and changed American life and industry.
If the two rules from the Environmental Protection Agency are enacted as proposed, they would put the world’s largest economy on track to slash its planet-warming emissions at the pace that scientists say is required of all nations in order to avert the most devastating impacts of climate change.
The government’s challenge to automakers is monumental. Last year, all-electric vehicles accounted for just 5.8% of new cars sold in the United States. All-electric trucks were even more rare, making up fewer than 2% of new heavy trucks sold.
Nearly all major automakers have already invested billions in producing electric vehicles at the same time as they continue to manufacture the conventional vehicles powered by gasoline, which deliver their profits. The proposed regulations would require them to invest more heavily and reorient their processes in ways that would essentially spell the end of the internal combustion engine.
The EPA is “proposing the strongest-ever federal pollution technology standards for both cars and trucks,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in remarks outside EPA headquarters Wednesday. “Together, today’s actions will accelerate our ongoing transition to a clean vehicle future, tackle the climate crisis head on and improve air quality in poor communities all across the country.”
“This is historic news,” he said.
The EPA cannot mandate that carmakers sell a certain number of electric vehicles. But under the Clean Air Act, the agency can limit the pollution generated by the total number of cars each manufacturer sells. And the agency has set that limit so tightly that the only way manufacturers can comply is to sell a certain percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Each model year that the rule is in effect, car companies will report to the federal government the average greenhouse emissions of all new cars sold. Companies that fall short of the standard could be penalized in different ways, including fines of billions of dollars.
The proposed regulations will surely face legal challenges from those who see them as government overreach. A group of about a dozen Republican attorneys general has filed lawsuits against the Biden administration’s climate polices, and one of its leaders, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, suggested the group would fight the newest proposals.
“This administration is hellbent on destroying America’s energy security and independence by making us dependent on resources and components that can come only from abroad,” Morrisey said. “Over the coming weeks, we’ll be taking a closer look at the proposed rule, and we’ll be ready to once again lead the charge against wrongheaded energy proposals like these.”
The proposed tailpipe pollution limits for cars, first reported by The New York Times on Saturday, are designed to ensure that 67% of sales of new light-duty passenger vehicles, from sedans to pickup trucks, will be all-electric by 2032. Additionally, 46% of sales of new medium-duty trucks, such as delivery vans, will be all-electric or use some other form of zero-emissions technology by the same year, according to the plan.
The EPA also proposed a companion rule governing heavy-duty vehicles, designed so that half of new buses and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold, including 18-wheeler big rigs, would be all-electric by 2032.
Combined, the two rules would eliminate the equivalent of carbon dioxide emissions generated over two years by all sectors of the economy in the United States, the second-biggest polluting country on the planet after China.
But some autoworkers and manufacturers fear that the transition to all-electric vehicles envisioned by the Biden administration goes too far, too fast and could result in job losses and lower profits.
While major automakers have invested heavily in electrification, they are apprehensive about customer demand for the pricier all-electric models; the supply of batteries; and the speed with which a national network of charging stations can be created.
Autoworkers fear job losses, since electric vehicles require fewer than half the number of workers to assemble than cars with internal combustion engines. Labor unions are particularly concerned because many new electric vehicle plants and battery factories are being built in Southern states that are politically hostile to unionized labor and where wages are relatively low.
“There is no good reason why electric vehicle manufacturing can’t be the gateway to the middle class that auto jobs have been for generations of union autoworkers,” Shawn Fain, president of the Detroit-based United Auto Workers, said in a statement. “But the early signs of this industry are worrying, prioritizing corporate greed over economic justice.”
Union workers and car manufacturers have been expressing their various fears directly to the president since 2021, when Biden announced an executive order directing government policies to ensure that 50% of all new passenger vehicle sales be electric by 2030.
As word spread last week that Biden’s new regulations were designed to go still further, some automakers pushed back.
John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers, questioned how the EPA could justify “exceeding the carefully considered and data-driven goal announced by the administration in the executive order.”
“Yes, America’s transition to an electric and low-carbon transportation future is well underway,” Bozzella said in a statement. “EV and battery manufacturing is ramping up across the country because automakers have self-financed billions to expand vehicle electrification. It’s also true that EPA’s proposed emissions plan is aggressive by any measure.
“Remember this: A lot has to go right for this massive, and unprecedented, change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” Bozzella said.
At least one American automaker, Tesla, is poised to emerge as a singular winner under the new rules because it produces only electric cars. Other automakers that have lagged in electrification technology have suggested that compliance would be a struggle, but none have yet said they would oppose the rules.
Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler — which makes Dodge, Ram and Jeep vehicles — was ranked last year by the EPA as the nation’s worst auto company in terms of fuel efficiency.
In a statement, Eric Mayne, a spokesperson for Stellantis, said the company was surprised by the proposed rules, since they are so much more ambitious than Biden’s previously announced target of 50% all-electric new vehicle sales by 2030. But for now, Mayne said, “We look forward to a constructive dialogue with the agency as the process moves forward.”
Engineers and scientists at an EPA automotive lab have been working over the past year to determine how much electric vehicle technology is likely to advance in the next decade in order to set the strongest, achievable tailpipe emissions limits.
David Haugen, the director of the lab, said that auto companies have always complained about new environmental and emissions standards. “We’ve heard that from them for 50 years, and then the companies have done a great job meeting them each time the standards came in, which gives us confidence that this one is also going to go well,” he said.
Tensions among the auto industry, autoworkers and the Biden administration played out over the past week, with the administration forced to rearrange its rollout of the proposal, according to three people familiar with what happened.
Officials had originally planned for Regan to announce the policies in Detroit, surrounded by U.S.-made all-electric vehicles.
But as auto executives and the UAW learned the details of the proposed regulations, some grew uneasy about publicly supporting it, according to the people familiar with their thinking. The setting was moved from Detroit to the EPA headquarters in Washington. No one from the UAW attended, according to the organization’s spokesperson, although Bozzella and representatives from Ford, General Motors and Mercedes were there.
In an interview, Regan acknowledged that some auto executives and leaders of the UAW had expressed anxiety over the proposals, adding that they could be amended to assuage those fears.
“We’re very mindful that this is a proposal, and we want to give as much flexibility possible,” he said.
The agency will accept public comments on the proposed rules before they are finalized next year. The rules would take effect starting with model year 2027.
Environmentalists praised Biden for delivering on a promise he made during his first days in office, when he called climate change a “moral imperative, an economic imperative” that would be central to all his decision-making.
A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to keep average global temperatures from increasing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, the effects of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failures and species extinction would become significantly harder for humanity to handle. The planet has already warmed by an average of about 1.1 degrees Celsius.
Biden has pledged to cut the country’s emissions in half by 2030 and to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2050. He took a major step toward meeting that target last summer, when he signed the Inflation Reduction Act. It includes $370 billion in spending over the next decade to fight climate change, including tax incentives up to $7,500 for the purchase of U.S.-made electric vehicles.
That law is projected to help the United States cut its emissions by 40% by 2030 — not quite enough to meet Biden’s pledge. Experts said the new EPA regulations, if enacted as proposed, were needed to reach Biden’s goal.
“The EPA standards are a huge step forward in addressing the largest source of climate pollution: transportation,” said Luke Tonachel, senior director of the clean vehicles and buildings program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.
A sharp rise in electric vehicles in the United States could mean wider availability and sales of electric vehicles outside its borders, Tonachel said.
“This can be a world-leading standard that puts the world on a much-needed pathway for curbing global pollution from transportation,” he said.
Laurence Tubiana, who helped broker the 2015 Paris climate accord and who is now CEO of the European Climate Foundation, welcomed the EPA’s action.
“This is confirmation to the world of the seriousness of the engagement of Joe Biden on climate change and keeps the U.S. as a front-runner on climate,” Tubiana said. “It’s resonating very well in Europe and the world.”

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration Wednesday proposed the nation’s most ambitious climate regulations to date, two plans designed to ensure two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032.
The new rules would require nothing short of a revolution in the U.S. auto industry, a moment in some ways as significant as the June morning in 1896 when Henry Ford took his “horseless carriage” for a test run and changed American life and industry.
The government’s challenge to automakers is monumental: Last year, all-electric vehicles were just 5.8% of new cars sold in the United States. All-electric trucks were even more rare, making up fewer than 2% of new heavy trucks sold.
Nearly all major automakers have already invested billions in producing electric vehicles at the same time as they continue to manufacture the conventional vehicles powered by gasoline, which deliver their profits. The proposed regulations would require them to invest more heavily and reorient their processes in ways that would essentially spell the end of the internal combustion engine.
If the two rules are enacted as proposed, they would put the world’s largest economy on track to slash its planet-warming emissions at the pace that scientists say is required of all nations in order to avert the most devastating impacts of climate change.
“By proposing the most ambitious pollution standards ever for cars and trucks, we are delivering on the Biden-Harris administration’s promise to protect people and the planet, securing critical reductions in dangerous air and climate pollution and ensuring significant economic benefits like lower fuel and maintenance costs for families,” the Environmental Protection Agency’s administrator, Michael Regan, said in a statement.
The EPA cannot mandate that carmakers sell a certain number of electric vehicles. But under the Clean Air Act, the agency can limit the pollution generated by the total number of cars each manufacturer sells. And the agency can set that limit so tightly that the only way manufacturers can comply is to sell a certain percentage of zero emissions vehicles.
The proposed regulations will surely face legal challenges from those who see them as government overreach.
“They are using this established longstanding statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal — the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles,” said Steven G. Bradbury, who served as chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration. “This is clearly driven by the president’s directive to achieve these results. I don’t think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the use of statutes in this way.”
The proposed tailpipe pollution limits for cars, first reported by The New York Times on Saturday, are designed to ensure that 67% of sales of new light-duty passenger vehicles, from sedans to pickup trucks, will be all-electric by 2032. Additionally, 46% of sales of new medium-duty trucks, such as delivery vans, will be all-electric or of some other form of zero-emissions technology by the same year, according to the plan.
The EPA also proposed a companion rule governing heavy-duty vehicles, designed so that half of new buses and 25% of new heavy trucks sold would be all-electric by 2032.
Combined, the two rules would eliminate the equivalent of carbon dioxide emissions generated over two years by all sectors of the economy in the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China.
But some autoworkers and manufacturers fear that the transition to all-electric vehicles envisioned by the Biden administration goes too far, too fast and could result in job losses and lower profits.
While major automakers have invested heavily in electrification, they are apprehensive about customer demand for the pricier all-electric models; the supply of batteries; and the speed with which a national network of charging stations can be created.
Autoworkers fear job losses, since electric vehicles require fewer than half the number of workers to assemble than cars with internal combustion engines do.
Automakers and union workers have been expressing those fears directly to the president since 2021, when Biden announced an executive order directing government policies to ensure that 50% of all new passenger vehicle sales be all-electric by 2030.
As word began to spread last week that his new regulations were designed to go still further, some automakers pushed back.
John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers, questioned how the EPA could justify “exceeding the carefully considered and data-driven goal announced by the administration in the executive order.”
“Yes, America’s transition to an electric and low-carbon transportation future is well underway,” Bozzella said in a statement. “EV and battery manufacturing is ramping up across the country because automakers have self-financed billions to expand vehicle electrification. It’s also true that EPA’s proposed emissions plan is aggressive by any measure.”
“Remember this: A lot has to go right for this massive — and unprecedented — change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” Bozzella said.
Engineers and scientists at the EPA have been working over the past year to determine how much electric vehicle technology is likely to advance in the next decade in order to set the strongest, achievable tailpipe emissions limits.
Tensions between the auto industry and the Biden administration played out over the past week, as the administration was forced to rearrange its rollout of the proposal, according to three people familiar with what happened.
Officials had originally planned for Regan to announce the policies in Detroit, surrounded by U.S.-made all-electric vehicles.
But as auto executives and the United Auto Workers learned the details of the proposed regulations, some grew uneasy about publicly supporting it, according to the people familiar with their thinking. The setting was moved from Detroit to EPA headquarters in Washington, where Regan announced the proposed regulations Wednesday morning.
In an interview, Regan acknowledged that some auto executives and union leaders had expressed anxiety over the proposals — adding that they could be amended to assuage those fears.
“We’re very mindful that this is a proposal, and we want to give as much flexibility possible,” he said.
The agency will accept public comments on the proposed rules before they are finalized next year. The rules would take effect starting with model year 2027.
Environmentalists praised Biden for delivering on a promise he made during his first days in office, when he called climate change a “moral imperative, an economic imperative” that would be central to all his decision-making.
A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to keep average global temperatures from increasing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, the effects of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failures and species extinction would become significantly harder for humanity to handle. The planet has already warmed by an average of about 1.1 degrees Celsius.
Biden has pledged to cut the country’s emissions in half by 2030 and to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2050. He took a major step toward meeting that target last summer, when he signed the Inflation Reduction Act. It includes $370 billion in spending over the next decade to fight climate change, including tax incentives up to $7,500 for the purchase of U.S.-made electric vehicles.
That law is projected to help the United States cut its emissions by 40% by 2030 — not quite enough to meet Biden’s pledge. Experts said the new EPA regulations, if enacted as proposed, are needed to reach Biden’s goal.
“The EPA standards are a huge step forward in addressing the largest source of climate pollution: transportation,” said Luke Tonachel, senior director of the clean vehicles and buildings program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. “If the strongest standards are finalized, it will put the U.S. on a path to end pollution from vehicle tailpipes and that’s essential to meeting both our climate and our public health goals.”
A sharp rise in electric vehicles in the United States could mean wider availability and sales of electric vehicles outside its borders, Tonachel said.
“This can be a world-leading standard that puts the world on a much-needed pathway for curbing global pollution from transportation,” he said.
Laurence Tubiana, the CEO of the European Climate Foundation who helped broker the 2015 Paris climate accord, welcomed the EPA’s action.
“This is confirmation to the world of the seriousness of the engagement of Joe Biden on climate change and keeps the U.S. as a front-runner on climate,” Tubiana said. “It’s resonating very well in Europe and the world.”

Full text: The LIV golfer was at 12 under with a three-stroke lead after two rounds when play was suspended because of inclement weather.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- After the Friday round of last year's Masters Tournament, Brooks Koepka stormed to a Mercedes-Benz parked at Augusta National Golf Club. He was in a fury, a four-time major tournament champion with a beat-up body, a war chest of pent-up ambition and another missed cut.
He tried twice with his fist to break the back window, which did not so much as crack, a pair of low moments in a year so overrun with them that one of the finest golfers of his generation found himself wondering whether he should play on.
"If I wasn't going to be able to move the way I wanted to, I didn't want to play the game anymore -- it's just that simple," Koepka said on Friday, when he recounted how it sometimes took 20 minutes to get out of bed, or how he had sometimes feared demanding too much of his knee.
But as Koepka gave the world a new glimpse into his tormented mind and sustained agony, it was as the leader of the Masters, where his five-under-par 67 in Friday's second round gave him a three-stroke lead when play was suspended for the day because of inclement weather.
A victory on Sunday -- or whenever the tournament ends, given a Saturday forecast of two inches of rain and winds reaching 30 miles per hour -- would be of an exorcism of sorts for Koepka, who went from champion to close-but-not-quite to cut material over just a few years. It would also be a singular achievement for LIV Golf, the circuit Koepka joined last year after Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund bankrolled it with billions of dollars, and assure Koepka that, even as much of the golf establishment denigrates his new league, he can play the Masters for life and, likely, other majors for at least five more years.
"If you win one here," Koepka said Friday, "it kind of ticks a lot of boxes, doesn't it?"
Indeed. It would also put him a British Open victory away from a career Grand Slam.
Koepka approached the first tee on Friday sharing one-third of the lead with Viktor Hovland and Jon Rahm, who had also carded 65s on Thursday. With poor weather looming, he figured an early start would be an advantage. By the time Augusta National briefly suspended play for the first time on Friday, he was well past signing his scorecard, and Rahm and Hovland had not even made the turn. Rahm had not gained so much as a stroke after six holes, and Hovland had surrendered one after seven.
Meanwhile, Sam Bennett, a 23-year-old amateur from Texas A&M University, had picked up four shots to move to eight under. His 68 on Friday matched Marvin Ward's Masters record from 1940 for the lowest second round by an amateur. No amateur has ever won the tournament, first played in 1934.
But Bennett, who trailed Rahm by a stroke after the world's third-ranked golfer birdied the eighth and ninth holes, certainly outmaneuvered many professionals. Rory McIlroy, No. 2 in the Official World Golf Ranking, had a miserable Friday and was poised to miss the cut at the conclusion of the second round, which Augusta National officials hope to restart on Saturday.
Although the cut line could shift and some were still playing, the past major champions Bryson DeChambeau, Sergio García, Louis Oosthuizen and Bubba Watson were all in significant danger of exiting the tournament. That would dent the showing of the LIV circuit that upended golf's outward civility and turned players, in the minds of the league's critics, into symbols of greed and a surreptitious Saudi quest to repair the kingdom's tarnished reputation.
For Koepka, who earned about $ 38 million in prize money on the PGA Tour, LIV has been his most prominent proving ground lately. He has won two of the circuit's events, including a tournament in Florida last weekend.
On Friday at the Masters, he scarcely waited to break the tie he faced at daybreak. He moved to the top of the leaderboard with a birdie at No. 2, one of those eminently gettable holes where a potential champion should make headway.
He made par on the next five holes, and then he reached No. 8, the 570-yard par-5 that Rahm eagled on Thursday.
After his drive, Koepka figured he had about 256 yards to the pin. A smear of mud encrusted part of the ball, leaving Koepka to wonder what it would do. He wanted to leave the ball short of the pin, clutched his 3-iron and took a swing that, he said, he could not have made not all that long ago, not with that uphill lie and a lack of power.
The ball landed just short of the green, and then bounced onto it, rolling toward the right. A putt later, he, too, had an eagle at No. 8. Birdies at No. 13, which is playing 35 yards longer this year, and No. 15 sealed his 67, a bogey-free round on a day when McIlroy had four just on the front nine.
"He drove it well, hit his irons well, chipped it well and putted it well," said Gary Woodland, the 2019 U.S. Open winner who was grouped with Koepka on Thursday and Friday. "It was a clinic for 36 holes."
Such a show of force seemed improbable until only recently, and it was still so unexpected that Koepka being able to linger in a crouch at No. 13, which he birdied on Friday, was notable.
For some time, he said afterward, he had been angry when he did something so simple and standard for a professional golfer, angry about how he had slipped at home and dislocated a knee -- and burst a kneecap and tore a ligament when he tried to relocate the knee himself.
Had he been healthy, he acknowledged Friday, the decision to join LIV, with its guaranteed money and 54-hole, no-cut tournaments, probably would have been a closer call. Around the time LIV's first season ended in the fall, he said, he began to believe he was on the verge of a revival. By the end of January, he felt all but certain of it.
"I've got a completely different knee, so the normal is a little bit different, but swing-wise, it still feels the same," he said. "I'm able to do everything I need to, and the confidence is there. The confidence was lost just because of my knee and that was it."
Hovland, who was through 10 holes when play was suspended, and Collin Morikawa, who had finished his round, were tied for fourth at six under, just behind Rahm and Bennett.
The nearest LIV player to Koepka's score was Phil Mickelson, who trailed the leader by eight strokes. For the embattled league, that gap is almost beside the point. Koepka's surge at Augusta is perhaps the circuit's most welcome reprieve after months of setbacks, including legal defeats, a miserly television contract in the United States and, according to a court filing from LIV, revenues of "virtually zero." (A federal judge in California ruled Friday that a trial in the acrimonious litigation between the PGA Tour and LIV would not begin in January 2024, as had been planned. The judge did not immediately set a new trial date.)
LIV's detractors and rivals, particularly the PGA Tour, have reveled in its troubles and pined for its demise. At the same time, many in the golf establishment fretted over the possibility that a LIV player could soon enough prevail at one of the sport's grandest competitions.
At last summer's British Open, a reporter asked the R&A's chief executive whether a LIV player hoisting the claret jug would amount to the governing body's "worst nightmare."
After all, the executive, Martin Slumbers, had just lashed LIV's model as "not in the best long-term interests of the sport" and "entirely driven by money."
"Whoever wins on Sunday is going to have their name carved in history," Slumbers replied then, "and I'll welcome them onto the 18th green."
The sport's leaders came only so close to such a scene last summer. One like it might now be only two rounds away -- once, of course, the second round actually concludes.

Full text: The Biden administration hopes its guidelines for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits will encourage automakers to reduce their reliance on China for batteries and raw materials.
The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will significantly shorten the list of electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Officials hope the change will push carmakers to move their supply chains out of China and to the United States or its allies.
The rules, issued by the Treasury Department, are a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change by encouraging the use of zero-emission vehicles and green energy. The law also seeks to reduce the industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of critical raw materials.
For purchases of their electric cars to qualify for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits, automakers must meet strict requirements for where they assemble the cars and batteries and where they get the materials that go into batteries. Only a handful of vehicles are expected to qualify for the full credit when the rules, which are more stringent than previous requirements, go into effect April 18, down from 21 now.
The new rules, which could be revised in response to comments from the public, will require that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in each electric car's battery come from domestic sources or countries with which the United States has trade agreements.
The full list of qualifying cars will not be published for a couple of weeks, but Tesla has begun informing buyers that the changes would affect its lineup. The company said on its website that the least expensive version of its Model 3 sedan, one of the most popular electric cars, would no longer be eligible for the full credit. The car uses a battery made in China.
General Motors said Friday that three electric vehicles it plans to sell this year -- the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles -- would qualify for the full credit.
James M. Wickett, a partner at Hogan Lovells who focuses on tax and energy policy, said the electric vehicle tax credit was "moving supply chains, to the tune of tens of billions."
"The details matter in a significant way," he added.
One significant detail on Friday expanded the program to include battery minerals from Japan and paved the way for adding more countries, such as the 27 members of the European Union.
Officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have also begun discussing plans to build a kind of buyers' club for critical minerals that could exert pressure over the global industry, including setting higher labor and environmental standards for mining, processing and manufacturing.
The race is on for manufacturers whose vehicles don't qualify for the U.S. tax credits to procure the minerals and components that will satisfy the requirements. The credit awards a significant competitive advantage to any car that makes the grade.
To be eligible, at least 50 percent of the components in an electric car battery must be made in North America. And 40 percent of the minerals used to make the batteries, which often contain nickel, manganese and cobalt, must come from domestic sources or from countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The minerals quota will rise every year until it reaches 80 percent by 2027, and the component quota will climb to 100 percent in 2029.
The administration said it would later issue rules clarifying how much investment that companies could receive from countries like China and Russia and still qualify for tax credits. The law includes prohibitions on using critical minerals and battery components from a "foreign entity of concern," a term that includes companies based in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Siyu Huang, the chief executive of Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts company that is developing advanced batteries with backing from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, welcomed the trade agreement with Japan. But she said it would be "very challenging" to acquire battery-grade lithium because almost all the refineries are in China.
"The critical part of this is really about where the lithium is coming from," Ms. Huang said.
In writing the rules, Biden officials have tried to balance two priorities: Encouraging Americans to buy cleaner cars to mitigate climate change, and trying to bring more factories for cars, batteries and battery materials to the United States and its allies.
Company executives, and some analysts, said the administration had come down on the side of the latter goal. Given the limited number of vehicles that currently qualify for tax credits, some consumers could decide to wait to buy an electric car until more become eligible in a few years, said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
"What always happens if people are uncertain is they hold on to their wallets," Mr. Reinsch said.
Jennifer Safavian, the chief executive of Autos Drive America, which represents foreign carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen, welcomed Japan's inclusion and said it would help strengthen supply chains. Yet, she added, the drop in the number of eligible cars would slow the growth of electric cars.
But some lawmakers complain the Biden administration has been too generous to foreign companies. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a pivotal player in the Inflation Reduction Act's writing and passage, said this week that he may bring a court case challenging the administration's interpretation of the law.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Manchin said that the Treasury Department's guidance "completely ignores the intent" of the act.
"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains," he said. "American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas."
The legislation has already shaken up the car industry. Immediately after President Biden signed the bill in August, a provision excluded from the tax credits any electric vehicles not made in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
Hyundai and Kia cars made in South Korea no longer qualified, angering that nation's leaders, who felt betrayed by a close military and trade partner. Sales of South Korean-made electric vehicles have since lost market share in the United States.
The law also proved to be a major source of friction diplomatically. Leaders of the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies feared the program would lure investment away from their countries or force them to offer more generous subsidies to compete with the United States.
Because the European Union, Japan and Britain do not have free-trade agreements with the United States, products from those countries, including battery materials, did not qualify for any portion of the tax credits.
Under pressure from foreign governments, the Biden administration proposed a workaround. In a news release, the Treasury Department said the law did not define the term "free trade agreement," which "could include newly negotiated critical minerals agreements." The Biden administration signed a limited trade deal with Japan on Tuesday covering critical minerals, and is negotiating a similar deal with the European Union.
But the strategy has been strongly criticized by lawmakers in Congress, who have said the administration failed to consult with them on trade policy, or argue that U.S. taxpayer money will now subsidize Japanese industry.
For consumers, the new rules are likely to make many electric vehicles more expensive.
At least some Tesla vehicles are likely to remain eligible. The company makes cars in California and Texas and batteries in Nevada. Ford Motor said it would "soon" disclose whether any of its vehicles qualify.
Carmakers will have to certify whether their vehicles meet the components and minerals requirements. The Internal Revenue Service will enforce the rules. Some vehicles may qualify for only half the credit if, for example, they meet the component quotas but not the minerals quotas.
The list of eligible cars is expected to grow as it becomes easier for companies to buy processed lithium and other materials from U.S. trade partners like Canada and Australia. Numerous companies are developing mines and building refineries. More cars will also qualify once Hyundai, Ford, Honda and other automakers finish building new car and battery plants in the United States.
And a loophole in the law allows companies to collect the credits if they lease vehicles to customers, even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers could pass on those credits to consumers by reducing monthly lease payments.

In a Tiny Hungarian Village, a Big Fight Over a Chinese Plant: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A $ 7.8 billion factory planned by a Chinese company in eastern Hungary has become divisive even within the party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who championed it.
The small-town mayor, long a loyal foot soldier for Hungary's governing party, recently committed what he described as "political suicide," throwing himself in the path of an enormous $ 7.8 billion Chinese battery factory project promoted by his dissent-intolerant prime minister, Viktor Orban.
"It is like lying in front of a steamroller," Zoltan Timar, the mayor of Mikepercs, said of his decision to side with residents opposed to the project, which his Fidesz party championed. "I just hope it won't roll over me too soon."
The factory, which would be the biggest of its kind in Europe, is the fruit of a yearslong diplomatic and economic tilt by Mr. Orban away from the West toward countries like China and Russia. It promises to put Hungary at the center of a wrenching and, for some, highly profitable green transition, with electric cars leading the way.
But residents in Mikepercs, a Fidesz stronghold in eastern Hungary, are seething over the arrival on nearby farmland of bulldozers and dump trucks preparing the way for the Chinese plant. Many worry the project would create pollution, drain their water supply and bring an influx of Chinese and other foreign workers.
"Pocketknives have opened up in everyone's pocket," said Eniko Pasztor, a pensioner and opponent of the factory, using a Hungarian phrase used to express anger.
Two public hearings on the venture, held in the nearby city of Debrecen in January, descended into chaos amid fistfights and shouts of "traitor" directed at officials by residents anxious about their future health and property values.
Taman Polgar Toth, a journalist with a local news site, Debreciner, said he "had never seen anything like it -- hundreds of people yelling and fighting."
Behind the noise, however, lie two of the most consequential and closely entwined issues of the day: China and climate change. Disagreement over what to do about either has thrust tiny Mikepercs (population: 5,300) into a global ruckus.
In a push to dominate new technologies vital to the reduction of carbon emissions, China has lavished tens of billions of dollars' worth of tax breaks and other subsidies on its electric carmakers.
It is now the world's biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, led by Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., or CATL, the company behind the Hungarian project.
China's dominance of the industry has raised alarm in the United States, where a recent battery-factory project involving CATL in Virginia collapsed after Gov. Glenn Youngkin denounced it as a "front for the Chinese Communist Party." In Europe, there have been warnings about the risks of dependence on Chinese battery manufacturers.
CATL already has a $ 2 billion plant in Germany that was widely welcomed, but its plans for the larger one in Hungary has left it at odds with the nearly half of the country's population that, according to a survey this week, wants new battery plants banned.
Mr. Orban's courtship of China and its investors is part of Hungary's "Eastern Opening," a policy he announced in 2010 in an abrupt turn away from his previous role championing democracy, human rights and Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
The shift has delighted Beijing. On a visit last month to Budapest, the Hungarian capital, China's senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, praised Hungary for its "China-friendly policy."
Many other European countries have soured on China, in part because of its support for Russia over the war in Ukraine. But Hungary -- already isolated from its NATO and European Union allies because of its equivocal stand on the war -- has doubled down.
"He is the last man standing as a friend of China in the European Union," said Tamas Matura, a foreign relations scholar at Corvinus University in Budapest.
When Hungary announced the battery plant last August, it trumpeted it as the biggest foreign investment in the country's history.
Previous Chinese megaprojects in Hungary, notably a nearly $ 3 billon high-speed railway between Budapest and Belgrade, the capital of neighboring Serbia, have been mired in delays and accusations of corruption relating to secret contracts for Mr. Orban's allies in business.
Now, the battery plant has been met with stiff opposition, first from local residents, and then from opposition politicians and civil society activists.
They were joined last week by the governor of Hungary's central bank, Gyorgy Matolcsy, a former Fidesz stalwart who accused Mr. Orban's government of stoking inflation by pursuing economic growth through large foreign investments in basic manufacturing, like battery plants. Hungary has become a manufacturing hub for German carmakers, Asian companies like Samsung, which has a battery plant near Budapest, and others foreign corporations.
The new Chinese battery factory is expected to create 9,000 jobs, but some economists say the macroeconomic gains, like years of robust growth, from such projects are offset by the inflation they help fuel. Hungary has Europe's highest annual rate of inflation, running at around 25 percent.
Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapest, a prominent liberal critic of both Mr. Orban and China who has renamed several streets in the capital to give them names like "Free Hong Kong Road," said the "huge Chinese factory is a symbol of Hungary's model of capitalism" based on what he said were "low wages, low environmental standards and low protection for workers."
"In Hungary, we have socialism for the elites and capitalism for the masses," he said.
More worrying for the government is the public rift, small but highly unusual, that has opened up within the ranks of Fidesz.
Mr. Timar, the mayor of Mikepercs, won 100 percent of the vote in the last election in 2019, his fifth victory in a row for the party.
Struggling to contain discontent among its supporters, Fidesz has deployed its vast media apparatus to paint the furor over the battery plant as the work of outside agitators funded by the Hungarian-born financier George Soros, the governing party's go-to villain, and "fake" residents mobilized by the opposition.
But Fidesz's problems began last November, when a group of women in Mikepercs, angry that they had not been consulted about the Chinese project, organized a street protest, the first of many.
Ms. Pasztor, the pensioner, joined other women to form Mothers of Mikepercs, a group that wants to halt construction of the factory until residents have reliable information about what it would mean for their water supply, noise levels and pollution. Another big question they have is where the plant's workers would come from, since unemployment in the area is nearly nonexistent.
The mayor, Mr. Timar, held a town-hall meeting and invited CATL to address local concerns. The company, he said, told him it was "too busy" to send someone to answer questions.
Asked about the meeting, a spokesman for the Chinese company, Fred Zhang, said CATL "communicates regularly" with the mayor and has been "actively responding to questions and concerns from local residents."
Many of the concerns, he added, "are misinformation and misunderstanding. We intend to strengthen our communications with local communities in the future."
Ms. Pasztor said she has nothing against China but did not want neighborhood houses turned into dormitories for Chinese and other foreign workers, a widespread concern after years of anti-immigrant fear-mongering by Mr. Orban and his party's media machine.
The Fidesz mayor of Debrecen, Laszlo Papp, a strong supporter of the Chinese factory, acknowledged that many locals were upset but said this was largely because there "is a lot of fake information" about how much water the plant would use, where factory workers would come from and other issues.
He added that it was important to keep an eye on long-term economic development and not be distracted by "momentary shifts in the public mood" driven by political rivalries. "You can't run a city on the basis of mood and feelings," he said.
The Chinese factory, its supporters say, is vital for the whole country.
"The green transition is inevitable, and we want to be part of it," said Mate Litkei, director of the Climate Policy Institute in Budapest, hailing the Chinese investment as an important contribution to the shift away from fossil fuels.
Mr. Litkei said that Hungary needed to ensure there were enough batteries on hand before 2035, when a European Union ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars will start.
Mercedes-Benz Group, which has a big factory in Hungary, welcomed CATL's plans, saying it would be the "first and biggest customer of the new plant's initial capacity."
When CATL in January opened a much smaller battery factory in Germany, it met with no opposition from local residents or German environmentalists, whose Green Party is part of the coalition government in Berlin.
In Hungary, however, politics have become so polarized and toxic, with Fidesz for years vilifying environmental activists as agents of Mr. Soros, that neither side trusts the other.
Hungarian environmentalists see electric cars as a big improvement on carbon-emitting vehicles, but point to the damage caused by the mining and processing of lithium, cobalt and other hazardous materials used to make batteries.
On top of that, said Peter Ungar, co-chairman of the Green Party of Hungary, factories like the one next to Mikepercs consume vast amounts of water and energy and cover arable land with concrete. CATL's Hungarian plant would cover an area around the size of 400 football fields.
"Batteries are not our salvation," Mr. Ungar said. "Nor is China."

Many of the concerns, he added, “are misinformation and misunderstanding. We intend to strengthen our communications with local communities in the future.”
Pasztor said she has nothing against China but did not want neighborhood houses turned into dormitories for Chinese and other foreign workers, a widespread concern after years of anti-immigrant fearmongering by Orban and his party’s media machine.
The Fidesz mayor of Debrecen, Laszlo Papp, a strong supporter of the Chinese factory, acknowledged that many locals were upset but said this was largely because there “is a lot of fake information” about how much water the plant would use, where factory workers would come from and other issues.
He added that it was important to keep an eye on long-term economic development and not be distracted by “momentary shifts in the public mood” driven by political rivalries.
“You can’t run a city on the basis of mood and feelings,” he said.
The Chinese factory, its supporters say, is vital for the whole country.
“The green transition is inevitable, and we want to be part of it,” said Mate Litkei, director of the Climate Policy Institute in Budapest, hailing the Chinese investment as an important contribution to the shift away from fossil fuels.
Litkei said that Hungary needed to ensure there were enough batteries on hand before 2035, when a European Union ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars will start.
Mercedes-Benz Group, which has a big factory in Hungary, welcomed CATL’s plans, saying it would be the “first and biggest customer of the new plant’s initial capacity.”
When CATL in January opened a much smaller battery factory in Germany, it met with no opposition from local residents or German environmentalists, whose Green Party is part of the coalition government in Berlin.
In Hungary, however, politics have become so polarized and toxic, with Fidesz for years vilifying environmental activists as agents of Soros, that neither side trusts the other.
Hungarian environmentalists see electric cars as a big improvement on carbon-emitting vehicles but point to the damage caused by the mining and processing of lithium, cobalt and other hazardous materials used to make batteries.
On top of that, said Peter Ungar, co-chair of the Green Party of Hungary, factories like the one next to Mikepercs consume vast amounts of water and energy and cover arable land with concrete. CATL’s Hungarian plant would cover an area around the size of 400 football fields.
“Batteries are not our salvation,” Ungar said. “Nor is China.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Real Estate Broker Pleads Guilty in Scheme to Profit From New York City Shelters: [National Desk]

Full text: Sheina Levin was a former business partner of Victor Rivera, whose dealings were the subject of a New York Times investigation.
The owner of a Brooklyn real estate company pleaded guilty this week to paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks to a homeless-shelter operator in a yearslong scheme to profit from programs meant to help homeless people.
The real estate company owner, Sheina Levin, specialized in renting housing to nonprofit groups. On Thursday, she admitted to bribing Victor Rivera, the former leader of one of the largest nonprofit homeless-shelter contractors in New York City, to lease property from her company and tap into a stream of city funding earmarked for housing homeless people, according to papers filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Rivera, the former chief executive of the Bronx Parent Housing Network, pleaded guilty last year to federal crimes related to the same scheme and was subsequently sentenced to 27 months in federal prison. His dealings with Ms. Levin, as well as a pattern of sexual assault and harassment accusations against him, were first detailed in a New York Times investigation in 2021.
Ms. Levin was charged on Thursday and immediately pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud for the kickback scheme, which stretched from May 2019 to January 2021.
In previous court filings, federal prosecutors said Ms. Levin's real estate company, Urban Residences Corp., had paid nearly $ 690,000 in bribes to Mr. Rivera, her onetime business partner, so that his group would rent a Bronx building she controlled.
The kickbacks were disguised as consulting fees to a company run by Mr. Rivera's son, which had "few if any business expenses," according to court filings. Prosecutors said the elder Mr. Rivera used the money to make mortgage payments on his home.
"This unscrupulous real estate company owner resorted to bribes and kickbacks to become the landlord of choice for a taxpayer-funded nonprofit that provides vital homeless shelter services," said Jocelyn E. Strauber, the commissioner of New York City's Department of Investigation, which investigated the case with prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
Ms. Levin's lawyer, Michael Farkas, declined to answer questions about the case, but he said in a statement that "this matter, and Ms. Levin's conduct, are far more complex than suggested by the D.O.I. commissioner."
As rates of homelessness have risen in New York, city officials have struggled to crack down on financial misconduct among some shelter contractors. Under a unique court order that requires the city to provide temporary housing to every homeless person, New York City farms out the operation of its shelters to dozens of nonprofit groups. In recent times, public spending on these groups has swelled to more than $ 2 billion a year.
Mr. Rivera helped found the Bronx Parent Housing Network in 2000 on a shoestring budget, and he expanded the organization into one of the largest operators of homeless shelters in New York City. His organization received more than $ 274 million in city money to run dozens of homeless housing sites from 2017 to 2021.
But as the money flowed in, Mr. Rivera found an opportunity to get rich: He collected an annual salary of $ 453,000, drove a Mercedes-Benz leased by the nonprofit and steered millions of dollars in contracts to friends and associates.
Ms. Levin, his partner in a separate housing venture, was one of those associates.
The Times investigation showed how Mr. Rivera's organization paid millions of dollars in rent to Ms. Levin's real estate company to lease two buildings for housing homeless people.
In court filings, federal prosecutors also detailed Mr. Rivera's pay-to-play relationship with three contractors doing business with his organization. He arranged for a construction company, RJP Construction, to get contracting work in exchange for $ 66,000 in bribes, court filings show.
The construction company's owner, Fernando Rodriguez, faced criminal charges for his role in the bribery scheme in March 2021 and pleaded guilty to these and other charges in a separate health care fraud case. In January, Mr. Rodriguez was sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to pay more than $ 66,000 in restitution to the Bronx Parent Housing Network.
Mr. Rivera also steered millions of dollars in contracts to a security firm, Prime Protective Bureau, in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks and a guarantee that the company would hire his former wife for a high-paying job. No one involved with the security company has been charged.
Prosecutors said the largest illicit payments to Mr. Rivera came from Ms. Levin's company. The felony charge Ms. Levin pleaded guilty to carries a maximum prison term of 20 years, according to a Department of Investigation spokeswoman. Ms. Levin's sentencing hearing is scheduled for July. As part of her plea, she agreed to forfeit more than $ 790,000 and pay restitution of more than $ 838,000 to the Bronx Parent Housing Network.

Change Remains The Only Constant As M.L.S. Returns: [Sports Desk]

Full text: St. Louis City S.C. will hit the field as the league's 29th franchise, but to watch it, and every other team, fans will have to get to know Apple TV+.
St. Louis, a city with a rich soccer history dating back more than a century, will finally get its Major League Soccer team this year. But to watch it, and the league's other 28 teams, armchair supporters will have to make the transition from television to streaming, whether they like it or not.
Here's what is happening with M.L.S. in 2023.
What's new?
For the seventh straight season, M.L.S. is expanding. St. Louis City S.C. will be the league's 29th team -- a total that may grow in the next few months -- and play in a new stadium downtown, Citypark.
St. Louis had long been a target for expansion; the city had a pioneering professional soccer league in the early 1900s and N.A.S.L., indoor and minor league teams more recently. But previous efforts all failed, torpedoed either by inadequate financing or, in 2017, a public referendum in which voters rejected a plan to finance a stadium for an expansion franchise.
Even when St. Louis did finally get a team, its debut was put on hold for a year because of delays brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Now, though, the team that M.L.S. and St. Louis fans have long coveted is here.
The new team includes Roman Burki, a 32-year-old Swiss goalkeeper with seven years at Borussia Dortmund under his belt, and Klauss, a Brazilian striker. But if recent M.L.S. history is any indication (not you, Atlanta United), St. Louis City is likely to suffer typical expansion woes as it tries to build a winner.
It may not be the lowest team on the M.L.S. totem pole for long, however: Commissioner Don Garber has made clear that the league's expansion will not stop at 29. "We do need more teams," Garber said this week in New York. A 30th franchise will be announced by the end of the year, he said, with San Diego and Las Vegas currently leading the contenders. Garber also cited Phoenix, Sacramento, Detroit and Tampa, Fla., as possibilities for further expansion in the near future.
What will Week 1 bring?
Thirteen games will be played on Saturday, starting with New York City F.C.'s visit to Nashville on Saturday afternoon. The big game comes later in the day: M.L.S. is expecting a crowd of more than 70,000 in the Rose Bowl on Saturday to watch the Los Angeles Galaxy, now playing second fiddle in the city they once ruled, take on the defending league champion, L.A.F.C.
The Philadelphia Union, which lost last season's M.L.S. Cup championship game in an excruciating manner, will kick off against Columbus at home. And Atlanta United, which led the league in attendance again last season, expects another big crowd inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium for its opener against San Jose.
How can I watch?
M.L.S. is banking on its younger fan base's familiarity with technology (and its aversion to traditional TV) as it moves the bulk of its games to Apple TV+ as part of a 10-year, $ 2.5 billion broadcast contract.
For hard-core M.L.S. fans, that will mean a deluge of content: every game, including the playoffs and the Leagues Cup tournament with the Mexican league; English and Spanish broadcasts; a Red Zone-style whip-around show hitting the highlights of games as they happen; and no blackouts for out-of-market games.
The cost is $ 79 a year with an Apple TV+ subscription and $ 99 without, but several games each week will be broadcast free throughout the season.
As for traditional television, ESPN is out of the mix, as are all local broadcasts around the country. Fox and FS1 will broadcast roughly one game a week, part of a conscious effort to keep one foot in the traditional broadcasting world as the league dives headlong into something new. "We didn't want to go cold turkey and shut it all down," said Gary Stevenson, the league's deputy commissioner.
Who is going to win the M.L.S. Cup?
The list of favorites has to start with L.A.F.C., which won the Supporters' Shield with the best regular-season record last season and then added the M.L.S. Cup title, becoming the first team to pull off that double since Toronto F.C. in 2017. The Welsh star Gareth Bale, whose tenure was known for limited minutes and stunning goals, has retired, and the team's top scorer, Cristian Arango, has moved to the Mexican league, so expect more of the load to fall on the club legend Carlos Vela, now 33.
Philadelphia had the same number of points as L.A.F.C. last season and a much better goal difference (plus-46 to plus-28), but it lost the Shield because it had fewer wins and then the final in the most agonizing way possible.
The Union are well equipped to find their way back. Andre Blake is the reigning goalkeeper of the year, Jakob Glesnes was last season's defender of the year and Dániel Gazdag will again provide the goals.
Nashville should rely on last season's league most valuable player, Hany Mukhtar, who led M.L.S. with 23 goals. After a shaky first season, Austin took a huge step forward by reaching the Cup semifinal last season and now will look to improve even more. Inter Miami was a .500 team last season, but it has added Josef Martínez, who had 98 goals in six years with Atlanta United. If he can regain his past scoring form, he makes any team a title contender.
The playoffs changed again. How will they work?
Expansion and playoff tinkering are two time-honored M.L.S. traditions, and this week the league announced yet another new postseason format. This season, 18 teams will make the playoffs, up from 14, and there will be a new play-in round for the lowest-ranked two in each conference. After four years of strictly one-and-done games, M.L.S. will introduce a best-of-three format for the round of 16. But the quarterfinals and beyond will revert to single-game eliminations. Confused? Here's some supplemental reading with all the rules.
What about side competitions?
The Concacaf Champions League, the regional championship that was won by an M.L.S. team, the Seattle Sounders, for the first time in 22 years last season, begins in March with L.A.F.C., Philadelphia, Vancouver, Orlando and Austin participating. The two-legged final ends on June 4.
League games will be halted from mid-July to mid-August for an expanded 77-game Leagues Cup that will include every team from M.L.S. and Mexico's Liga MX. Those games all will be held in the United States and Canada.
And the American M.L.S. teams will join the venerable U.S. Open Cup, which dates back to 1914, in April, with the final scheduled for Sept. 27. The defending champion is Orlando City F.C., but the safest of bets is that an M.L.S. team will win it again. The last non-M.L.S. team to win the Open Cup was the Rochester Raging Rhinos in 1999.

Lucid Steps Up Production As Supply Chains Stabilize: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The maker of electric luxury sedans said it made more than 7,000 cars in 2022, achieving a scaled-down target.
Lucid Motors said on Wednesday that it increased production of its luxury electric sedans by more than 50 percent in the fourth quarter, as better supplies of parts and materials allowed the company to slightly exceed its manufacturing target for the full year.
The carmaker said it produced 7,200 vehicles in 2022, its first year of manufacturing in significant numbers, including 3,500 in the fourth quarter. In August, the company said it aimed to make 6,000 to 7,000 cars during the year.
That target, however, had been lowered from an earlier goal of 20,000 vehicles. And the report on Wednesday disappointed Wall Street investors who had expected more. Lucid shares fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading.
Even as shortages of some parts and materials persist, "it's much better than it was," Peter Rawlinson, Lucid's chief executive, said in an interview.
Shipping cars remains a problem, Mr. Rawlinson said, helping to explain why deliveries of 4,400 vehicles last year fell short of production.
Along with Rivian, a maker of electric pickup trucks, Lucid is among the most prominent companies trying to take advantage of the shift to electric vehicles and challenge traditional carmakers.
Lucid's main selling points are efficiency and range. All variations of the sedan can travel at least 450 miles on a full charge, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That's more than any Tesla model.
Still, the odds are long. Tesla is the only new American carmaker in more than a century to achieve mass production and survive as an independent company. Auto manufacturing requires huge upfront investment, and profit margins are usually thin.
Lucid's least expensive model, the Air Touring, sells for $ 107,400, competing for wealthy buyers with companies like Mercedes-Benz and Porsche that have introduced luxury electric cars. Lucid has announced plans to begin selling an $ 87,000 model this year.
The company plans in the next years to produce cars that could compete with Tesla's more affordable Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, Mr. Rawlinson said on Wednesday.
Lucid, which has the backing of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, has $ 4.9 billion in cash, enough to survive at least through the first quarter of 2024, the company said in an earnings report on Wednesday.
Sales in the last three months of 2022 were $ 258 million, up from $ 195 million in the third quarter. Lucid reported a loss in the fourth quarter of $ 473 million, down from a loss of $ 530 million in the previous quarter.
The company does not expect to make a profit in 2023 as it continues to ramp up production, Sherry House, Lucid's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
Lucid said Wednesday that it aimed to produce 10,000 to 14,000 cars in 2023. Potential customers have reserved more than 28,000 vehicles as of this week, the company said, not counting up to 100,000 cars that Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy.
Mr. Rawlinson cautioned that not all of the reservations, which are nonbinding, would translate into sales. "You can never count your chickens before they're hatched," he said.

Full text: An agreement with the White House to allow electric cars made by other automakers is part of a broad effort to improve charging and increase sales of battery-powered vehicles.
Tesla will open some of its fast chargers, which had been exclusive to its customers, to all electric vehicles by the end of next year, the Biden administration said on Wednesday as it announced a broad effort to improve charging and encourage more people to buy battery-powered vehicles.
The company's network of fast chargers has been a key element in the company's success by giving drivers confidence that they will be able to charge cars during longer trips. The company's network also has a reputation for being faster and more reliable than the networks available to owners of electric vehicles made by other manufacturers. Those chargers require drivers to download special apps and often are hard to use or out of commission.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States, and its network could provide a significant boost to the Biden administration's plans to encourage electric vehicle ownership and fight climate change. Financial incentives to car buyers and manufacturers, part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats in Congress last year, are already making some electric vehicles as cheap to buy as comparable gasoline cars.
The Biden administration said 7,500 Tesla chargers will be open to other vehicles by the end of 2024. Of those, 3,500 are fast chargers capable of recharging a vehicle in about half an hour to an hour. The rest are slower chargers at hotels, restaurants and other destinations that are already available to owners of other car brands if they buy an adapter.
Tesla has about 17,700 fast chargers in the United States, according to the Department of Energy, meaning that most of the network will remain closed to electric vehicles made by General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and others.
Tesla said the opening of its network would be part of a major expansion. "Our U.S. network will more than double by the end of 2024 to support our growing Tesla fleet and new E.V. customers," the company said on Twitter without providing further details.
By opening its network, Tesla can earn revenue from owners of its competitors' vehicles, but may also diminish one of its main advantages as it faces stiffer competition from established carmakers.
"It's a double-edged sword for Tesla," said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research. "It helps to grow the industry. It demonstrates that Tesla wants to be a team player. On the other hand, this reduces a competitive advantage vis-à-vis the other manufacturers who are way behind in creating their own charging networks."
Tesla already allows other vehicles to use its chargers in a pilot program in 14 European countries, including France, Germany and Britain. The company's network in Australia and Iceland is also open to other cars.
Tesla's decision to open its network means the company will become eligible for some of the $ 7.5 billion in grant money that Congress authorized as part of a bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021. The money is meant to help create a nationwide charging infrastructure. The administration announced rules for the program Wednesday, including requirements that the equipment be manufactured in the United States, and that chargers function without specialized mobile phone apps.
Chargers will be required to accept a standard form of payment, such as credit cards. Charging companies will be required to offer toll-free numbers where drivers can pay by phone. Another possibility is that apps for charging networks like ChargePoint or EVgo would be programmed to work with other networks, in the same way that an A.T.M. card from one bank can be used at the machines owned by other banks. California, which has more electric vehicles on the road than any other state, already requires chargers to accept major credit cards.
The fragmented charging system in the United States is a major frustration for electric vehicle owners, who often find that they must download apps and enter personal details and payment information before they can charge. The procedures used to activate charging equipment also differ from company to company, leading to confusion.
Companies that offer charging must also ensure that the network works 97 percent of the time, a requirement that could cull weaker providers and force the industry to make its equipment and software more reliable. Charging systems must be standardized, the administration said in a fact sheet.
The requirements are achievable, said Mike Calise, Americas president for Tritium, an Australian manufacturer of charging equipment that has a factory in Lebanon, Tenn.
"This is very good for the industry, very good for E.V. adoption," Mr. Calise said of the administration's plan. Tritium said Wednesday that it would increase its work force in Tennessee by 50 percent, to 750 employees, to help meet increased demand.
The Biden administration's goal is to build a network of 500,000 chargers in the United States by 2030, up from 130,000 today, and increase electric vehicles' share of new car sales to 50 percent, compared with 6 percent last year. All 50 states are participating in a program designed to line major highways with fast chargers no more than 50 miles apart.
Manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz, G.M. and Ford plan to install charging equipment at dealerships and other locations. ChargePoint, Volvo and Starbucks will work together to install chargers at 60 Starbucks locations between Denver and Seattle. The truck stop operators Pilot Flying J and Travel Centers of America also plan to install chargers.
Most owners of electric cars charge their vehicles at home using a dedicated 220-volt connection that can typically fill up a car battery in about eight hours, but that is often not an option for people who rent homes or apartments. Charging electric cars using a standard 110-volt outlet can take up to 60 hours.
Executives in the electric vehicle industry said they were glad that the administration had established rules for charging infrastructure. "This regulatory certainty is going to make it easier to move forward," said Anne Smart, vice president of global policy for ChargePoint, which has installed chargers at stores, restaurants, gas stations and other locations. Expansion of the charging system "will move quickly," she added. "It's a lot of funding."

U.S. Aid Worker Was Killed by Guided Missile, Video Shows: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Times analysis suggests that an intentional strike, not an indiscriminate attack, most likely killed Pete Reed. It is unclear whether the attackers knew he was with a group of aid workers.
Roughly a minute after an American paramedic, Pete Reed, and a team of aid workers began tending to a wounded civilian in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on Feb. 2, they were attacked. Mr. Reed, a former U.S. Marine volunteering on the war's front lines, was killed, and several of his colleagues were wounded.
Volunteers at the scene initially attributed the strike to indiscriminate Russian shelling. But a frame-by-frame analysis of a video taken at the location -- and shared with The New York Times -- shows that Mr. Reed, who was unarmed, died in a targeted strike by a guided missile almost certainly fired by Russian troops.
It is unclear if the Russians knew the group was made up of aid workers. But its convoy had markings that should have signaled to the Russians the type of vehicles they were hitting. One of the vehicles was clearly marked with a red cross, and the type of weapon used in the attack -- a laser-guided antitank missile -- is usually fired when a gunman sees and selects a target.
Still, the target in this case, a white Mercedes-Benz van, did not have any clearly visible medical markings, and while the aid workers were unarmed at least one medic was wearing military-style camouflage.
The video shows Mr. Reed and the group of aid workers standing beside the white van, which they were using to transport humanitarian supplies. A missile flying parallel to the ground directly hits the van, destroying it and killing Mr. Reed.
The video was filmed on a smartphone by Erko Laidinen, an Estonian volunteer with an organization called Frontline Medics who was trailing just behind Mr. Reed.
The footage appears to show that the strike involved a Kornet antitank guided missile, which has a range of around three miles. Mr. Reed and the aid workers were at a slightly elevated position along a street that led toward the Russian front line, around two miles away.
Mr. Laidinen said that his vehicle's dash camera had also recorded the episode, and that the footage showed a second missile strike, which was aimed at another vehicle but missed its target. The footage has yet to be made public.
A volunteer named Roma, who was standing near Mr. Reed when the missile struck and who was wounded in the blast, told The Times in an interview that there had been no military units nearby. One of the vehicles at the scene was clearly marked as an ambulance, he said.
He provided only his given name because of safety concerns.
A photograph published by The Wall Street Journal shows an injured Norwegian medic running from the scene of the attack. It also shows the ambulance marked with a red cross on a white background across the street from where Mr. Reed and other volunteers were attacked.
Experts said the type of weapon used should have enabled the attacker to identify the nature of the target. With weapons such as these, "you have an expectation that the firer is going to have the ability to differentiate between a medical worker and a combatant," said Marc Garlasco, a war crimes investigator who is in Poland training Ukrainian teams investigating war crimes.
Mr. Garlasco added that the episode required further investigation, but that on its face it was a "potential war crime."
A video of the aftermath shows the aid workers' white van destroyed by the attack. Debris is strewn around the area, and a body is lying lifeless on the ground.
Bakhmut, an industrial city surrounded by salt mines with a prewar population of around 70,000 people, has been under intense bombardment since the summer. In recent weeks, Russian troops have come increasingly close to encircling the city.
With a small population of civilians still present in the city, aid workers like Mr. Reed and his teammates have served as lifelines for people sheltering in basements without heat and with dwindling rations. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said it would no longer allow aid groups into the city.
Mr. Reed and his team were alerted to the wounded civilian by Ukrainian troops that had just returned from the area. The street had been under shelling or missile attack at some point: At least one other vehicle had been destroyed in the same area, though it was unclear when, Roma said.
Ukrainian forces traverse the battlefield in all types of civilian vehicles, including privately owned sedans and school buses. It is therefore possible that Mr. Reed was targeted because his team had simply driven into a kill zone frequently targeted by Russian troops.

Tesla Workers at a Factory in Buffalo Begin a Campaign to Form a Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If successful, the workers who help develop Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance system will be the first group at the company to organize.
A group of workers at a Tesla factory in Buffalo began a campaign on Tuesday to form a union, saying they want better pay and benefits. If successful, the effort could establish the first union at the fast-growing auto and energy company, which has fiercely resisted efforts to organize its employees.
The factory in Buffalo makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla's website, and also has about 800 workers who help develop driver-assistance software for cars. The software workers initiated the union drive, and went public Tuesday in an effort to win broader support at the site.
Tesla pays workers in Buffalo less than national averages and they receive little sick time, workers involved in the drive said. "We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build," Keenan Lasch, a member of a group calling itself Tesla Workers United, said in a statement.
The employees are working with Workers United, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. The union campaign was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Attempts to organize Tesla workers have so far failed. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has been openly hostile to unions. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company's car factory in Fremont, Calif., and that Mr. Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The company's nonunion workplaces potentially give the company a cost advantage over established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, whose employees are represented by the United Auto Workers in the United States. Unionized workers generally receive better pay and benefits than workers who are not represented.
The U.A.W. has so far been frustrated in its attempts to expand beyond the Michigan automakers. In recent years, attempts to organize workers for foreign automakers with factories in the South, including Nissan, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, have failed.
Tesla is the latest big technology company to be the target of labor organizers. Amazon workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted in April to unionize, but workers at an Amazon facility in Albany, N.Y., voted in October against union representation.
The drive in Buffalo has the support of Jaz Brisack, who gained national prominence for her efforts to organize Starbucks workers in Buffalo.
"So incredibly glad to be working with the Tesla workers on their campaign!" Ms. Brisack said on Twitter on Tuesday.
The Autopilot workers in Buffalo analyze data collected by cars to improve the software, which has been blamed for numerous crashes, some fatal. Federal officials have asked Tesla for documents related to the self-driving software, the company disclosed last month.
Tesla has openings for jobs in Buffalo that entail labeling images and videos collected from cars. No experience in artificial intelligence or data labeling is required, according to two job postings on its website.
Workers said they were committed to Tesla's mission but wanted a greater voice. In an open letter to fellow workers, they said they wanted to form a union that would "be as innovative as the company we work for and to build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company."
"As much as I love my job, it can feel very disheartening living paycheck to paycheck when I work for one of the most successful companies in the world," Zahra Lahrache, who has worked at Tesla in Buffalo for five months, said in a statement issued by the workers, "and that is why I am exercising my right to unionize."

Garlasco added that the episode required further investigation, but that on its face it was a “potential war crime.”
A video of the aftermath shows the aid workers’ white van destroyed by the attack. Debris is strewn around the area, and a body is lying lifeless on the ground.
Bakhmut, an industrial city surrounded by salt mines with a prewar population of around 70,000 people, has been under intense bombardment since the summer. In recent weeks, Russian troops have come increasingly close to encircling the city.
With a small population of civilians still present in the city, aid workers like Reed and his teammates have served as lifelines for people sheltering in basements without heat and with dwindling rations. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said it would no longer allow aid groups into the city.
Reed and his team were alerted to the wounded civilian by Ukrainian troops that had just returned from the area. The street had been under shelling or missile attack at some point: At least one other vehicle had been destroyed in the same area, though it was unclear when, Roma said.
Ukrainian forces traverse the battlefield in all types of civilian vehicles, including privately owned sedans and school buses. It is therefore possible that Reed was targeted because his team had simply driven into a kill zone frequently targeted by Russian troops. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Impact of Tom Brady’s Retirement Is Still Unfolding

Tom Brady will not be competing on a football field next fall. That much is certain, at least if you believe his second retirement will stick.
In the past, NFL players had to file paperwork with the league office to receive certain retirement benefits, and determining if a player had formally retired or not offered insight into whether the decision would stick.
But times have changed.
“There is no requirement to submit official paperwork,” Brian McCarthy, an NFL spokesperson, wrote in an email. “A public statement from a player, such as participating in a press conference or posting a video from a beach, would suffice.”
By the “posting a video from a beach” standard, Brady is officially retired, as far as the league is concerned, and the clock can start ticking on his eligibility for benefits and being voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
There could, however, be one more slight delay in that process: Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, told CNN that he wanted to sign Brady to a one-day contract so he could retire as a member of the Patriots — the team he played for in 20 of his 23 NFL seasons. The symbolic gesture is sometimes used so a star player can get a proper goodbye from the team he was most associated with.
Brady’s retirement, however, leaves others — notably the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Fox — to ponder their futures. Brady was one of the greatest players in the history of the game, and his absence will have a ripple effect on the sport.
The Buccaneers must first determine how serious Brady is about retirement. If his decision is not set in stone, they will have to consider whether they want to try to lure him back. But assuming he is done, they must answer a question all NFL teams are eventually faced with: Are we competitive or not?
The Buccaneers sneaked into a divisional title and an appearance in the playoffs despite a losing record this season. Injuries piled up for the Buccaneers, a veteran-laden team that had mortgaged its future to be competitive for as long as Brady was on the roster.
Now that he isn’t, and the bill has come due, does general manager Jason Licht blow up the team? Does Blaine Gabbert, the team’s backup quarterback, get a promotion, or will the team seek a replacement like Jimmy Garoppolo, who is set to enter free agency after six seasons with the San Francisco 49ers? (That Garoppolo had once been seen as Brady’s heir apparent in New England adds intrigue.)
Whatever Tampa Bay decides, Brady will linger on the team’s balance sheet. Because of the way his contract was restructured last year, he will count as $35 million against the team’s salary cap for the 2023 season. The Buccaneers are already $55 million over the salary cap, according to Spotrac.
There is some administrative maneuvering the Buccaneers can engage in to spread out the hit of Brady’s contract, but ultimately they will have to account for that money.
Brady, who had plenty of leverage with Tampa Bay, made substantially more money each year he played for the Buccaneers than he did in his time with the Patriots, where he took a number of team-friendly contracts. Even as a slightly diminished player, he could still have commanded a hefty sum to play next season. But unlike some peers who hang around for paychecks, Brady will be well compensated in his post-NFL life.
Last offseason, Fox signed Brady to a huge contract to join the network’s top NFL announcing booth once he retired. This came shortly after Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, who had called Fox’s top games for two decades, decamped together to ESPN.
Brady’s deal has been reported by The New York Post as being worth $375 million over 10 years, although Fox has not confirmed that amount and has declined to comment.
Without Buck and Aikman, and with Brady still playing, Fox promoted Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen, a former Carolina Panthers tight end, to their top booth. Burkhardt and Olsen will call the Super Bowl next weekend. But presumably Brady will replace Olsen at some point, possibly soon.
Before this season, Olsen said he was going to try to do as good a job as possible to make the decision for Fox executives to replace him with Brady as difficult as possible. And if they still do it?
“At the end of the day, I’m a big boy,” he said in a radio interview last month. “I know what I signed up for. I took a chance on myself. I rolled the dice.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Tom Brady’s Last Season Didn’t Go as Planned. Was It Worth It?

The debates on sports talk shows and in barbershops about who is the greatest football player of all time will always start with Tom Brady. He is the most accomplished player in NFL history, with two decades of dominance over the sport. But along with all of the exclamation points — seven Super Bowl titles! Five Super Bowl MVP awards! — Brady’s career also now carries a question mark:
Should he have come back for one last season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after initially retiring last year?
Brady, who announced his retirement again Wednesday, saying he meant it this time, did not have the kind of year, either on the field or off, that he had been used to when he returned to the Buccaneers at age 45. His season and his career ended in a 31-14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in an NFC wild-card game last month, but things had started to unravel long before that.
Because of his style as a pocket passer (even early in his career he was not a scrambler), Brady relied heavily on having a talented offensive line that could give him time to find open receivers. The Buccaneers had built one of the best offensive lines in the league. But before this season, guard Alex Cappa bolted for the Cincinnati Bengals in free agency, guard Ali Marpet retired, and center Ryan Jensen suffered a knee injury in training camp that sidelined him for the regular season.
Brady himself missed 11 days in training camp to attend to what coach Todd Bowles called “some personal things.” His absence generated speculation about Brady and his relationship with former model Gisele Bündchen. In October, the couple divorced after 13 years of marriage, one day after the Buccaneers’ fifth loss in six games.
Throughout the season, the Buccaneers’ offense struggled to score, and Brady threw for just 25 touchdowns, tied for the fifth-worst total of his career as a full-time starter. Brady had never hidden his frustrations with a struggling offense, whether while playing with the New England Patriots or Tampa Bay, sometimes slamming tablet computers on the sideline or yelling at linemen.
This year, Brady turned to a new tactic when frustrated: tripping or kicking defensive players. Brady kicked Atlanta Falcons defensive lineman Grady Jarrett at the end of a play in a Week 5 win and was fined $11,139 by the NFL. In the postseason loss to Dallas, Brady tried to slide tackle Cowboys safety Malik Hooker. (The slide tackle, illegal in football, is allowed in soccer.) The NFL fined Brady $16,444. He planned to appeal because, he said on his podcast, “I didn’t even hit him. I tried to trip him, but I didn’t.”
The problems off the field continued. Brady endorsed FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed last year. Many of the millions of people who lost money expressed some animus toward Brady and other celebrity endorsers. Brady himself was a major shareholder in FTX, according to a court document, and his stake went from tens of millions of dollars to virtually zero.
“I sure don’t feel bad for him,” said Lee Smith, a retired tight end whom the Patriots drafted before he played 11 seasons with Buffalo, Oakland and Atlanta. “Maybe his crypto losses I feel the worst for him on. And his family stuff because, once again, man, the guy’s a human being. He’s not a robot.”
Brady’s human vulnerability caught up with him. Getting hit by abnormally large men is a part of a quarterback’s job description, but in his final year Brady seemed afraid to face that, which was perhaps understandable given his age. Whether because of fear, pressure in the pocket or both, he made throws into the ground to avoid hits and threw a costly interception in the season-ending loss to the Cowboys. This year’s Buccaneers finished with the worst record (8-9) of any team for which Brady was the full-time starter in his NFL career. And the Buccaneers were only in the playoffs because their division, the NFC South, was the worst in the NFL.
Pundits stopped bloviating about how great Brady was for his age and insisting he could play into his 50s, as they did when he retired the first time, and began begging him to quit.
“You out here looking like somebody that’s stealing money,” Marcus Spears, a former NFL defensive lineman who is now an ESPN personality, said on a podcast. He added: “Bro, go home, bro. Go home. Figure out something else to do. I know it’s Tom Brady. I know it’s the GOAT. You scared to get hit, and you play football. Those two things don’t align.”
Many debated whether Brady, who was a free agent after the 2022 season, would sign with another team. The San Francisco 49ers, his favorite team as a child in the Bay Area, seem to be a good quarterback away from a Super Bowl appearance. The Las Vegas Raiders have Brady’s longtime offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, as their head coach and many talented offensive players.
“Honestly, after watching tonight’s game, who would want Tom Brady starting on their team next year?” Ryan Clark, a former NFL defensive back who works as an ESPN personality, wrote on Twitter after the Buccaneers’ loss to the Cowboys.
So was coming back in 2022 worth it for Brady? He will likely answer that one day on his podcast or on a Fox broadcast, for which he will be a commentator. Brady wasn’t terrible in his final season; he threw for the third-most passing yards in the league and the sixth-highest total of his career. But he was clearly not the player he once was nor did he have a championship-level team around him. So Brady’s career, which had played out like the perfect Hollywood movie, came to what seemed to be an unsettling end.
“All of us have to go out on our terms, or we won’t be happy, and most of us don’t get to leave on our own terms,” said Smith, who retired after the 2021 season, his 11th in the NFL. “They make that decision for you. So I think that it was worth it because he gets to have the closure that he walked away when he was supposed to.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

It’s Second and So Long for Brady

Tom Brady, one of the world’s most decorated professional athletes and widely viewed as the greatest player in NFL history, announced Wednesday that he would retire. For good this time.
“I’ll get to the point right away,” Brady, who just completed his 23rd season, said in a short video posted on social media. “I’m retiring. For good.”
He is expected to step into a role as a TV broadcaster, after signing a deal in 2022 with Fox Sports that was reportedly worth $375 million over 10 years.
Brady also runs several businesses. He founded health and wellness company TB12 Sports with his longtime trainer Alex Guerrero. He also has Religion of Sports, which is a media company, and the Brady Brand clothing line.
Brady, 45, exits his football career as the most accomplished player in the sport. He won seven Super Bowls and was named the MVP of five of those games, both NFL records. He sits atop the list for almost every major passing statistical category, including career completions (7,753), passing yards (89,214) and passing touchdowns (649), but distinguished himself most in the postseason, where he set records for game-winning drives (14) and fourth-quarter comebacks (nine).
The oldest active player in the NFL this season, Brady’s late-game heroics helped the Tampa Bay Buccaneers reach the playoffs again despite their 8-9 record. But the team lost in the wild-card round of the playoffs to the Dallas Cowboys by a 31-14 margin, which could not be surmounted even by Brady, whose last NFL pass was an incompletion aimed at Julio Jones.
This season was his worst as a professional but still elite by comparison. Brady threw for 4,694 passing yards, the third most in the league, while completing 66.8% of his passes.
He retired after his third season with the Buccaneers, a campaign that at one point looked as if it wouldn’t happen: Brady first announced his retirement on Feb. 1, 2022, but reversed that decision after less than six weeks.
The season occurred with the backdrop of a tense period in his personal life. Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, his wife of more than 13 years, announced in October that they had divorced. They have two children together — a son, Benjamin, 13, and a daughter, Vivian, 10. Brady also has a son, Jack, 15, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.
Hints of disharmony between Brady and Bündchen began circulating at the end of the 2021 season. He had previously said in interviews that his focus on his career caused issues in the marriage, and in September 2022, Bündchen told Elle magazine that she worried about his health if he continued to play. “Obviously, I have my concerns — this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present,” she said.
Brady missed several training camp practices in the summer, as well as two games in August for what was described as personal issues.
Brady joined the Buccaneers in 2020, leading Tampa Bay to a Super Bowl victory in his first year with the team. That season came after he left the New England Patriots, the franchise for which he had played his entire career to that point. Brady spent two decades in New England, where he won six world championships, but he did not come to new contract terms and left the team as an unrestricted free agent.
The Patriots drafted Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft. He won the starting quarterback job midway through his second season in 2001, replacing the injured Drew Bledsoe, and led New England that season to its first Super Bowl victory. Brady was linked to coach Bill Belichick throughout his career in New England as the two shaped one of the league’s marquee dynasties. Along with winning six Super Bowls, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most among the NFL’s franchises, the Patriots appeared in nine Super Bowls and 13 AFC championship games.
But his career in New England also faced challenges. The NFL in 2015 investigated whether the Patriots purposely deflated footballs to gain an advantage in the 2015 AFC championship game. Brady served a four-game suspension for being “generally aware” of the scandal known as Deflategate.
After appearing to fumble against the Oakland Raiders in a playoff game that preceded his first Super Bowl win, Brady was also the face of the so-called tuck rule, which states that if a quarterback loses possession of the ball while his arm completes an intentional forward motion, the play should be ruled an incomplete pass instead of a fumble.

Tom Brady: Answering the Questions You Didn’t Know You Had

You may have heard some Tom Brady news, straight from the quarterback’s mouth. But beyond the mere fact of his announcement Wednesday that he is retiring from the NFL, there is a lot more to know.
Who is Tom Brady?
Wait, seriously? You don’t know Tom Brady, the superstar NFL quarterback who has won seven Super Bowls?
Just kidding, I know who Brady is. But could you briefly review his career for me anyway?
Brady grew up in Northern California and played college football at Michigan. But he was unheralded enough to be drafted only in the sixth round by the New England Patriots in 2000, a slight he has used as motivation throughout his career.
The pick was a steal, as Brady led the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories. He moved on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a free agent and won a seventh Super Bowl, the most by any player. He was named MVP in five of those Super Bowls.
He finished with gaudy regular season stats: 7,753 complete passes, 89,214 passing yards and 649 passing touchdowns, all records, over 23 seasons.
In the playoffs, he has another 1,200 completions, 13,400 yards and 88 touchdowns. Again, those are all records.
Did you say 23 seasons? How old is this guy?
He’s 45 (and turns 46 on Aug. 3). He was the oldest player ever to play in the NFL besides a few kickers.
Didn’t he retire once before?
Yes, about a year ago. “I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore,” he wrote. Forty days later he made that competitive commitment again and decided to come back for the 2022 season.
Has he made a lot of money?
He was paid $30 million for his most recent season and has earned more than $300 million over his career.
In 2022, he was rated the ninth highest paid athlete in the world by Forbes, which estimated he made an additional $50 million above and beyond his salary in that year alone.
The extra cash comes from endorsements of cars, clothes and mobile service providers, among many other products.
Brady also endorsed FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed last year. Many of the millions of people who lost money in the failure declared some animus toward Brady and other celebrity endorsers. Brady himself was a major shareholder in FTX, according to a court document, and his stake went from tens of millions of dollars to virtually worthless.
Wasn’t he involved in some bizarre ball controversy?
Sadly, this answer could probably be book length. In short, Brady was accused of arranging to deliberately deflate the footballs used in a playoff game in January 2015 to gain a competitive advantage, a bizarre scandal that came to be known as Deflategate. After numerous claims of skulduggery and court appeals — yes this reached federal court — Brady finally agreed to accept a four-game suspension for being “generally aware” of the plot. He served the suspension during the 2016 season.
What’s next for him?
Before this season, Brady agreed to serve as a commentator for Fox Sports upon his eventual retirement. While his salary for that job is not public, various reports have put it at $20 million, $25 million or even $30 million a year. (The New York Post said it was worth $375 million over 10 years.)
No doubt his on-field prowess and off-field fame will continue to get him endorsement deals as well.
What about Brady’s personal life?
Brady has a son with actress Bridget Moynahan. He married model Gisele Bündchen, and they have a son and a daughter. The couple announced in October that they were divorcing after more than 13 years of marriage.
Brady is a longtime friend of former President Donald Trump, but he has mostly tried to stay cagey in public about his politics. Before Trump was elected in 2016, Brady had a “Make America Great Again” cap in his locker in 2015 and mused about a Trump administration (“There’d be a putting green on the White House lawn,” he predicted).
Brady founded the health and wellness company TB12 Sports with his longtime trainer Alex Guerrero. He also has Religion of Sports, which is a media company, and the Brady Brand clothing line.
What’s this I hear about a movie?
Fortuitously, or not, a movie called “80 for Brady” is opening on Friday. Sally Field, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno and Lily Tomlin play Patriots fans of a certain age who travel to the Super Bowl to see their hero. Brady appears in the film as himself, along with some of his old Patriots teammates. He is also credited as a producer.
By all accounts, Tom Brady is not going to be vanishing from sight anytime soon. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Tom Brady, one of the world’s most decorated professional athletes and widely viewed as the greatest player in NFL history, announced Wednesday that he would retire. For good this time.
“I’ll get to the point right away,” Brady, who just completed his 23rd season, said in a short video posted on social media. “I’m retiring. For good.”
Brady, 45, exits the league as the winner of seven Super Bowls, an NFL record, and atop the list for almost every major passing statistical category. He was the oldest active player in the NFL this season but still played at an elite level through the end.
Brady had announced on Feb. 1, 2022, that he would retire, but reversed his decision after less than six weeks and returned to play his third season in Tampa Bay. It was his worst as a professional — the team finished with an 8-9 record and lost in the wild-card round of the playoffs to the Dallas Cowboys. But Brady threw for 4,694 passing yards, the third most in the league, while completing 66.8% of his passes.
The season occurred in the backdrop of a tense period in his personal life. Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, his wife of more than 13 years, announced in October that they had divorced.
He is expected to step into a role as a TV broadcaster, after signing a deal in 2022 with Fox Sports that was reportedly worth $375 million over 10 years.
Brady also runs several businesses. He founded the health and wellness company TB12 Sports with his longtime trainer Alex Guerrero. He also has Religion of Sports, which is a media company, and the Brady Brand clothing line.
Brady joined the Buccaneers in 2020, leading Tampa Bay to a Super Bowl victory in his first year with the team. That season came after he had left the New England Patriots, the franchise for which he had played his entire career to that point. Brady spent two decades in New England, where he won six world championships, but did not come to new contract terms and left the team as an unrestricted free agent.
The Patriots drafted Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft. He won the starting quarterback job midway through his second season in 2001, replacing the injured Drew Bledsoe, and led New England that season to its first Super Bowl victory. Brady was linked to coach Bill Belichick throughout his career in New England as the two shaped one of the league’s marquee dynasties. Along with winning six Super Bowls, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most among NFL franchises, the Patriots appeared in nine Super Bowls and 13 AFC championship games.
But his career in New England also faced challenges. The NFL in 2015 suspended Brady for five games after an investigation into whether the team purposely deflated footballs to gain an advantage in the 2015 AFC championship game. Brady served a four-game suspension for being “generally aware” of the scandal known as Deflategate.
After appearing to fumble against the Oakland Raiders in a playoff game that preceded his first Super Bowl win, Brady was also the face of the so-called “tuck rule,” which states that if a quarterback loses possession of the ball while his arm completes an intentional forward motion, the play should be ruled an incomplete pass instead of a fumble.

Punk Dynamos' Unexpected Return: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The indie-rock band from Ohio was poised for a breakout when it lost its frontman, Tim Taylor, in a 1997 car accident. Now the group is releasing an EP of demos and taking the stage once again.
On a late May morning in 1997, a mangled lamppost surrounded by the wreckage of a 1977 forest-green Mercedes-Benz stood near Lawn and North Main Streets in Dayton, Ohio. Tim Taylor, the 28-year-old leader of Brainiac, the city's swiftly ascending synth-punk band, had been driving home alone from a local nightclub at about 3:25 a.m. when his car spun out of control, crashed and exploded in flames.
Brainiac -- often stylized as 3RA1N1AC -- had recently toured with Beck, played Lollapalooza and recorded with Kim Deal, John Peel and Steve Albini. The group was known for its hyper-energetic live performances, where Taylor writhed across the stage. According to the band's surviving members -- the bassist Juan Monasterio, the guitarist John Schmersal and the drummer Tyler Trent -- major labels, including Interscope and Elektra, were wooing the group with seven-figure offers. But when Taylor, the son of the cellist Linda Taylor and the jazz guitarist Terry Taylor, died in the accident, so did Brainiac, and the opportunities awaiting the band.
In the ensuing years, the group's influence was cited by figures as varied as Trent Reznor and Fred Armisen. "I still can't think of an artist that approaches their flavor of mad science -- clanging, clashing, vibrant, silly, scary, unafraid," said Sadie Dupuis of the band Speedy Ortiz, who named her solo project Sad13 as a Brainiac tribute. She called the band's mix of guitar heroics, processed screams and other experimentation "pure genius."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A 2019 documentary, "Brainiac: Transmissions After Zero," revived interest in the group and helped reunite Monasterio, Schmersal and Trent. "The documentary was really cathartic," Schmersal said in a phone interview. "Once the band was done, we all scurried away like ants from a magnifying glass. But we realized how much we enjoyed our friendship that dissipated by Timmy leaving."
With momentum from the documentary and downtime during the pandemic, Schmersal decided to finally open the Brainiac archives -- old suitcases filled with cassettes, photos and ephemera. "In the past, whenever I'd open the suitcases, I'd spiral out of control, then run away," he said. "But I started thinking about why I've held on to them for so long. And where they should go."
Now, 26 years after Taylor's death, Brainiac is releasing "The Predator Nominate EP," featuring nine never-before-heard demos, on Friday. "There's an eight-track reel-to-reel floating around with old recordings, but no one knows where it is," Schmersal said. "But 'Predator Nominate' is Brainiac's last concerted effort, our last complete thought, before the end."
During the band's brief run from 1992 to 1997, it released three full albums of chugging and sometimes sprawling punk that relied mostly on traditional rock instruments. Taylor, a singer, guitarist and keyboardist, also played a Moog, and often modulated his vocals with synths and effects, inspired by the Dayton funk innovator Roger Troutman. For its final EP, "Electro-Shock for President," which arrived only weeks before Taylor's death, Brainiac employed a more fully realized electronic palette that continues on "Predator Nominate."
"Brainiac went electronic when harsh rock music wasn't really being interpreted via electronics," said Kelley Deal of the Breeders, whose sister and bandmate, Kim, produced the 1995 Brainiac EP "Internationale." "They were always more liberal with song structure, but they still made radio-friendly music. Only they made it electronic. And so aggressive."
"Predator Nominate," which clocks in under 13 minutes, is more haunting than harsh. The title track channels early Cure recordings; "Smothered Inside" recalls Brainiac's indie-rock beginnings; lighthearted synth vignettes like "The Game" balance sad, jarring songs like "Going Wrong"; and "Kiss the Dog" is a pop gem.
The band's unexpected release of previously unheard music comes with another surprise: a return to the road. Brainiac is playing a handful of U.S. dates and a brief tour of the United Kingdom with Mogwai, whose singer and guitarist, Stuart Braithwaite, shared a bill with the band in the mid-90s as a budding musician. "They were hands down the weirdest and most engaging band I'd seen," Braithwaite wrote in his recent memoir. "Super melodic but incredibly obtuse."
Schmersal, who traditionally sang backup, will now serve as lead singer. "No one understands the nuances of this music like we do," he said. "If we don't perform it, you'll never hear it this way." The Dayton guitarist, vocalist and synth player Tim Krug, a student of the band for some 30 years, will join for the tour.
Trent, the band's drummer, emphasized that Taylor is irreplaceable. "For us, this is a way to still be in awe of Tim, to honor him, or else we wouldn't do it. And I wish people could see how much joy and life and healing Tim's mom gets out of this," he said. "Tim was one in a million."
In the years since Brainiac's premature end, Schmersal, who is now based in Palm Springs, Calif., founded the band Enon and went on to play with Caribou, Crooks on Tape and Vertical Scratchers. Monasterio, a freelance motion-graphics designer, moved to Los Angeles. Trent still lives in Dayton, where he serves as associate pastor at Lifepointe Church and director of a local nonprofit, Hope4 Kettering.
Monasterio, who befriended Taylor in fifth grade, called the release "probably the final chapter on Brainiac," and suggested others might take inspiration from it: "Maybe someone will tap into Tim's genius and make something beautiful. I think Tim would want that, too."
He recalled a conversation with his bandmate that has eerie resonance today. "One time, I was out with Tim, and I remember him saying, 'We have to rise like a phoenix from the flames,"' Monasterio remembered. "He was saying Brainiac had to be reborn in some way."

If Buffalo and Kansas City Meet, It Would Be in Atlanta: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If Kansas City and Buffalo advance to the conference championship round of the N.F.L. playoffs, the game will be held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, a neutral location.
The N.F.L. announced Thursday that Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta would serve as the neutral site for a potential A.F.C. championship game between Buffalo and Kansas City, should those teams advance.
That game would be played Jan. 29, a Sunday, at 6:30 p.m., Eastern time.
The N.F.L. last week approved a resolution to "mitigate the competitive inequities" caused by the cancellation of the Jan. 2 Bills-Bengals game because of Damar Hamlin's cardiac arrest.
That game, in Week 17, had significant playoff implications. Both the Buffalo Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals were in contention for the A.F.C.'s No. 1 seed, which comes with a coveted bye for the playoffs' first round and home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs.
The N.F.L. postponed the game after Hamlin's collapse, then announced later that the game would not be resumed or replayed. Kansas City was in first place when the game was stopped and then won its final regular-season game to finish with a 14-3 record and hold on to the conference's top seed.
Kansas City lost to the Bills (13-3) and the Bengals (12-4) during the regular season. Because Buffalo and Kansas City wound up playing an uneven amount of games, the N.F.L. decided that if the teams met in the conference championship, the game should be played at a neutral site. A matchup between other teams for the A.F.C. championship would be played at the home stadium of the team with the higher seed, the league said.
In a statement, the N.F.L. said playing the game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened in 2017 and hosted the Super Bowl in the 2018 season, would make sense because it is nearly equidistant from both Buffalo and Kansas City, Mo. (Buffalo is nearly 900 miles from Atlanta; Kansas City is nearly 800.)
Hamlin was discharged from a Buffalo hospital on Wednesday, and his continued improvement was cited by the league in its announcement.
"We are heartened by the continued improvement and progress of Damar Hamlin in his recovery, and Damar and his family remain top of mind for the entire N.F.L. community," Commissioner Roger Goodell said, adding that he was "grateful to Arthur Blank and the Atlanta Falcons for agreeing to host the A.F.C. championship game."
On Sunday, in the wild-card round, the Bills, who have the A.F.C.'s No. 2 seed, will host the Miami Dolphins, and the Bengals, with the No. 3 seed, will host the Baltimore Ravens.

Mercedes Plans to Build Charging Network in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The network could help increase the low number of charging stations, encouraging more people to buy electric vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz said Thursday that it would install a network of 2,500 high-powered chargers in the United States by 2027, a sign the German carmaker is expanding its commitment to electric vehicles by borrowing a page from Tesla's playbook.
The fast chargers, distributed among 400 stations, will operate under the Mercedes brand. Owners of the company's cars will have preferential access, although the network will be open to cars from other manufacturers.
Tesla started building charging stations years ago, and the network has been essential to the automaker's success by allaying the fears of car buyers that they won't have enough places to plug their vehicles in and could be stranded on the side of the road. Those U.S. fast chargers work only with Tesla cars, although the company has said it will open the network to other brands.
Mercedes's planned charging network is the latest sign that the company, which has lost customers to Tesla, is serious about electric vehicles. Last year, the company opened a battery factory in Alabama and began building an electric sport utility vehicle, the EQS, at its plant near Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Even when complete, Mercedes's network will be only about one-third as large as Tesla's is now. Still, the effort is more ambitious than any by other traditional automakers. Electrify America has 3,400 fast chargers at 790 locations in the United States, but does not prominently display the Volkswagen brand even though the German company founded the network and owns a majority of the business.
"This is a strategic decision to put our money where our mouth is," Ola Källenius, the chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, told reporters Thursday.
The company, already a partner in Ionity, a European charging network, also plans to install Mercedes-brand chargers in Europe and China but is beginning with the United States.
Mercedes will split the cost of the network with MN8, a solar energy producer that will provide energy to the sites. The companies said they planned to apply for federal subsidies available to companies that build chargers.
Mercedes owners will be able to reserve charger time at the network, which will be designed to work automatically with Mercedes cars so that drivers won't need to do anything except plug in the vehicle.
Charging and payment "all happens under the covers, in an invisible way," Pasquale Romano, the chief executive of ChargePoint, a maker of chargers that will supply charging equipment to Mercedes, said Thursday.
The automaker plans to start building the charging hubs this year. At least some of the devices will pump energy into cars at 350 kilowatts per hour, much faster than chargers typically found in the United States.
The hubs will be close to restaurants and restrooms, Mercedes said, for example near luxury malls that are frequented by the company's well-heeled customers. The hubs will have surveillance cameras for security.
Mercedes is trying to address complaints by electric vehicle owners that they feel unsafe while using chargers in isolated areas. The hubs will be in "a safe location," Markus Schäfer, the chief technology officer of Mercedes, said, "not in the backyard of a shopping center next to the dumpster."

Mercedes-Benz said Thursday that it would install a network of 2,500 high-powered chargers in the United States by 2027, a sign the German carmaker is expanding its commitment to electric vehicles by borrowing a page from Tesla’s playbook.
The fast chargers, distributed among 400 stations, will operate under the Mercedes brand. Owners of the company’s cars will have preferential access, although the network will be open to cars from other manufacturers.
Tesla started building charging stations years ago, and the network has been essential to the automaker’s success by allaying the fears of carbuyers that they won’t have enough places to plug their vehicles in and could be stranded on the roadside. Those U.S. fast chargers work only with Tesla cars, although the company has said it will open the network to other brands.
Mercedes’ planned charging network is the latest sign that the company, which has lost customers to Tesla, is serious about electric vehicles. Last year, the company opened a battery factory in Alabama and began building an electric sport utility vehicle, the EQS, at its plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
Even when complete, Mercedes’ network will be only about one-third as large as Tesla’s is now. Still, the effort is more ambitious than any by other traditional automakers. Electrify America has 3,400 fast chargers at 790 locations in the United States, but does not prominently display the Volkswagen brand even though the German company founded the network and owns a majority of the business.
“This is a strategic decision to put our money where our mouth is,” Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, told reporters Thursday.
The company, already a partner in Ionity, a European charging network, also plans to install Mercedes-brand chargers in Europe and China but is beginning with the United States.
Mercedes will split the cost of the network with MN8, a solar energy producer that will provide energy to the sites. The companies said they planned to apply for federal subsidies available to companies that build chargers.
Mercedes owners will be able to reserve charger time at the network, which will be designed to work automatically with Mercedes cars so that drivers won’t need to do anything except plug in the vehicle.
Charging and payment “all happens under the covers, in an invisible way,” Pasquale Romano, CEO of ChargePoint, a maker of chargers that will supply charging equipment to Mercedes, said Thursday.
The automaker plans to start building the charging hubs this year. At least some of the devices will pump energy into cars at 350 kilowatts per hour, much faster than chargers typically found in the United States.
The hubs will be close to restaurants and restrooms, Mercedes said, for example near luxury malls that are frequented by the company’s well-heeled customers. The hubs will have surveillance cameras for security.
Mercedes is trying to address complaints by electric vehicle owners that they feel unsafe while using chargers in isolated areas. The hubs will be in “a safe location,” Markus Schäfer, the chief technology officer of Mercedes, said, “not in the backyard of a shopping center next to the dumpster.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Soaring N.B.A. Star Brings His Friends Along for the Ride: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard, is having a career season as one of the N.B.A.'s top scorers. He's had a little help from his childhood friends.
Mark Daigneault thought he had his first day in Hamilton, Ontario, all mapped out: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the star guard he coaches on the Oklahoma City Thunder, would make his morning rounds to shoot hoops and lift weights, and Daigneault would ride along.
There was only one problem.
"I don't have room in my car," Gilgeous-Alexander told him, "because I pick up all my friends."
Sure enough, once Daigneault hopped out of his Uber at Gilgeous-Alexander's preferred gym in nearby Burlington, Daigneault found him working on his shooting as several young men in matching Thunder T-shirts rebounded for him.
Gilgeous-Alexander soon introduced Daigneault to his "super close homies," five childhood friends whose coordinated outfits that morning were no coincidence. They knew Daigneault was in town.
"We wanted to make a good impression," said Sunday Kong, a former high school teammate.
In Oklahoma City, Gilgeous-Alexander, 24, has established himself as one of the N.B.A.'s most dynamic players. On a young team with promise, he ranks among the league leaders in scoring, averaging a career-best 31.4 points a game, while shooting 50.5 percent from the field -- supercharged numbers that hint at his abilities as a 6-foot-6 guard who can absorb contact at the rim and create space on the perimeter.
Back home in Hamilton, a small city about 40 miles southwest of Toronto, five of Gilgeous-Alexander's pals -- a crew that also includes Mark Castillanes and Maurice Montoya, two of his best friends since elementary school, and Vincent Chu, who sat next to him in ninth-grade homeroom -- practically fall off their couches whenever he crosses up a defender.
"Anytime I see him do something on the court, I'm like, 'Hey, we practiced that!' " said Devanté Campbell, who played youth soccer with Gilgeous-Alexander.
Gilgeous-Alexander is always trying to improve, said Daigneault, now in his third season as the Thunder's coach. That makes him an ideal fit for Oklahoma City -- the same place where a young Russell Westbrook became a triple-double machine, Kevin Durant honed his perimeter game and James Harden crafted his step-back jumper. Each summer, Gilgeous-Alexander devises his own to-do list.
"Shai's got every resource available to him," Daigneault said. "If he wanted to hire a staff and move to Hawaii in the off-season, he could do it. Instead, he parks himself in Hamilton and works with friends who have been in his life forever."
In Gilgeous-Alexander's self-styled basketball lab, where a sneaker salesman and a restaurant manager throw defensive traps at him, and a college student and an aspiring doctor feed him passes, he prepares for his future by returning to his past.
"Those guys give me a sense of home," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "They give me back a piece of myself that feels like so long ago."
'I've got to get better'
Before he was getting buckets at Madison Square Garden and walking the runways at fashion week in Paris, Gilgeous-Alexander was someone else: the new kid at Regina Mundi Catholic Elementary School.
After moving to Hamilton from Toronto when he was 11, Gilgeous-Alexander met Montoya and Castillanes on his first day of sixth grade. Castillanes recalled showing him around.
"Kind of quiet," Castillanes said. "But once you got to know him, he became himself."
Gilgeous-Alexander impressed on the basketball court, Castillanes said, by being able to dribble and make layups with both hands. But as an undersized ninth-grader at St. Thomas More Catholic Secondary School, Gilgeous-Alexander was cut from the equivalent of the junior varsity and wound up on a team of other freshmen.
"I wasn't hurt by it," he said. "It was more a feeling of, I'm not good enough, so I've got to get better."
In his spare time, Gilgeous-Alexander would hoop with Montoya and Castillanes at their Filipino basketball league -- the start of a basketball odyssey. Gilgeous-Alexander spent his sophomore year at Sir Allan MacNab Secondary School on Hamilton's west side before he transferred again, this time to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in Chattanooga, Tenn., as he sought better competition.
Gilgeous-Alexander eventually landed at the University of Kentucky, where John Calipari, the team's coach, knew he needed to be tough on him. Otherwise, Calipari was going to hear about it -- from Gilgeous-Alexander's mother, Charmaine Gilgeous, a former Olympic runner for Antigua and Barbuda.
"When he played well, she would call me and say, 'Don't you let up on him,"' Calipari said.
Gilgeous-Alexander had arrived at Kentucky with a hitch in his jump shot -- Calipari compared it to Charles Barkley's herky-jerky golf swing -- and spent the early weeks of the season mostly coming off the bench. By the middle of January, he was blossoming as a starter. By June, he was the 11th overall pick in the 2018 N.B.A. draft, headed to the Los Angeles Clippers.
Gilgeous-Alexander played so well as a rookie that the Thunder put him on their wish list. That summer, when the All-Star Paul George wanted to be traded to the Clippers from Oklahoma City, the Thunder insisted that Gilgeous-Alexander be included in the deal.
Now in his fourth season with the Thunder, Gilgeous-Alexander is the face of a franchise that should come equipped with training wheels. Although Chet Holmgren, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2022 draft, is out for the season with a foot injury, the Thunder have a core that includes Josh Giddey, 20, and Luguentz Dort, 23. Even amid his emergence, Gilgeous-Alexander has never sought to separate himself from his teammates.
"I might have sworn at Lu before," Gilgeous-Alexander said, "but me and Lu lived together, and we're like brothers so it doesn't count."
Gilgeous-Alexander and Dort, who are also teammates on the Canadian men's national basketball team, are candid about their bromance. When Gilgeous-Alexander was vaccinated against the coronavirus, Dort held his hand. (Gilgeous-Alexander is afraid of needles.) When they were roommates, Dort accepted the perils of sharing space with someone who was recently voted GQ magazine's Most Stylish Man of the Year.
"I don't want to say his clothes are everywhere," Dort said. "But he has a lot of clothes -- clothes that have a lot of volume to them."
But while life in the N.B.A. is rewarding -- Gilgeous-Alexander is in the first year of a five-year contract extension worth about $ 180 million -- it can also be disorienting. So he dodges complacency as if it were a traffic cone, supplementing his time with the team by working with Olin Simplis, a high-profile skills coach.
And, of course, he heads to Hamilton at the start of each off-season to work out with friends who neither expect nor ask for anything in return.
'Just something that friends do'
After his first season in Oklahoma City, Gilgeous-Alexander wanted to make his summers more structured. So he hit up his buddies: Would they help him out five mornings a week?
"It wasn't even something that needed to be said," said Campbell, who works full-time at a Kids Foot Locker and assists with a girls' basketball league. "It was just something that friends do: If we want to see this guy grow and succeed, we need to be there for him no matter what."
Last summer, Gilgeous-Alexander would text his friends a few minutes before 7 a.m. to let them know that he was leaving his house -- his hoops-centric version of flashing the Bat-Signal.
"You get that text, and you know you have about 15 minutes to get ready," said Chu, a student at Toronto Metropolitan University.
Gilgeous-Alexander would retrieve his friends, one by one, in his pale brown Mercedes-Benz G-Class. Castillanes was typically the first stop.
"He always got the front seat," Chu said.
Once assembled, they often had enough time during the ride to Burlington to cram in a homespun version of "Carpool Karaoke." In June, Jack Harlow's album "Come Home the Kids Miss You" was on repeat. By July, they were tearing through Burna Boy's latest tracks.
"It's a refreshing start to the day to see all your friends," Chu said, "even when you're mad tired."
At the gym, they would warm up and stretch, then Gilgeous-Alexander would polish his shooting for about an hour as his friends rebounded for him. He usually filled the second hour with drills -- footwork, defense, passing -- before transitioning into half-court games of 3-on-3 with a lopsided feel.
"Shai takes all the shots," Campbell said.
His court work complete, Gilgeous-Alexander would drop his friends off so he could lift weights -- in another buddy's two-car garage. Nem Ilic, 27, who describes his work as "athlete development," spent last summer building Gilgeous-Alexander's lower body: lunges in the garage, weighted sled pushes in the cul-de-sac out front. (The neighbors always knew when Gilgeous-Alexander was around.)
"Guys in my position, you usually have to work your way up from high school to college to the pros," Ilic said. "And I have a unique timeline. It went straight to Shai."
In their own way, the friends are a part of it all.
"I think the N.B.A. is so crazy that he wants to come here and feel grounded," Chu said, "and we're all so grounded up here that we want to hear about N.B.A. life."
They can see Gilgeous-Alexander's progress -- and feel it, too, whenever they try to defend him on those early summer mornings.
"I want to say it's never really that much of a fun time," Campbell said.
They have busy lives of their own. Montoya, for example, manages a Hamilton-area restaurant. Castillanes recently relocated to Oklahoma City after Gilgeous-Alexander asked him if he would help manage his day-to-day life. And Kong works in public health while he prepares for medical school.
"You know how they say commitment will pay off if you improve by 1 percent every day? It's something you see in real time with Shai," Kong said. "And it's something I can apply to my own life."

Razor-Thin Win in Thriller Gives Georgia Work to Do: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Georgia scored in the final minute of the game, and Ohio State missed a field goal in the first minute of 2023.
ATLANTA -- The Georgia Bulldogs appeared very nearly finished, just as they had looked for much of Saturday night.
Adonai Mitchell had caught a touchdown in the final minute of the Peach Bowl, one of the College Football Playoff's semifinal showdowns, and Georgia had a lead of one measly point over Ohio State. But here were the Buckeyes, the No. 4 seed that had slid into the playoff after a debacle of a loss to Michigan, at the line of scrimmage and preparing to try a field goal to win.
The perpetual clock neared midnight Eastern time and the start of 2023. The clock that mattered more here, though, showed eight seconds, and the uprights stood 50 yards away, the kind of cruel distance that promised to leave one team a championship contender and the other an also-ran.
The snap came. Noah Ruggles swung his right leg, and then the ball swung wide to the left. The triumph of the comeback ordeal -- and it was very much an ordeal for the 79,330 people inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta -- would belong to Georgia, and Georgia alone. The Bulldogs won, 42-41, to advance to the national championship game against No. 3 Texas Christian, which toppled second-ranked Michigan in the Fiesta Bowl.
"We didn't play our best football game -- a lot of that had to do with Ohio State," said Georgia Coach Kirby Smart, who added, "If we want any chance at winning a national championship, we have to play a lot better football than we played tonight."
Indeed, the Bulldogs, like the Horned Frogs of T.C.U., have much to consider between now and their meeting in California on Jan. 9. Perhaps most urgently, Georgia will need to figure out where and how its vaunted defense, which entered the Peach Bowl having allowed opponents about 292 yards a game, went wrong enough to surrender 467.
Ohio State, of course, brought a formidable offense to Atlanta, with C.J. Stroud, a two-time Heisman Trophy finalist, at quarterback and a wizard of a receiver, Marvin Harrison Jr., all too ready to make any given play fodder for a hype video next season at the Horseshoe. For much of the night, that offense threatened to expel top-seeded Georgia and end its quest to become the lone back-to-back champion in playoff history.
Georgia was hardly caught unaware. Its players and coaches had preached how fearsome Ohio State could be and how the Buckeyes' loss to Michigan was far from an indictment.
The Bulldogs, who won last season's title as the No. 3 seed, had watched the film. They had studied the habits and tells of Coach Ryan Day's team. They had swagger and, effectively, a home-field advantage. And it still did not take long for the Buckeyes to conjure chaos.
It did not help that Georgia missed a 47-yard field goal on its opening drive. The ball returned to the Buckeyes, and Stroud used a 24-yard pass to Harrison to move Ohio State into Georgia territory. Later, Stroud took a snap and Harrison swept -- no, surged -- across the field and caught a touchdown.
The Bulldogs retaliated with a touchdown by way of a quick throw from quarterback Stetson Bennett to Kenny McIntosh, but quickly found themselves down 21-7 early in the second quarter, in part because of their own miscues. Bennett, himself a Heisman finalist, had thrown an interception that helped lead to an Ohio State score, and nerves were fraying in Atlanta and Athens, in Norcross and Waycross.
Georgia fans of this particular era, after all, are not accustomed to trailing by any margin, much less a double-digit one.
Still, Georgia trailed by 4 at halftime and eventually set up for its surge with less than nine minutes left in the game.
After a hapless Ohio State drive, Bennett found Arian Smith charging alone up the field. The throw arrived as Smith's feet reached the playoff logo at the Ohio State 25. He ran, ran and ran a little more. He could have slowed down a touch since no Buckeye defender was close enough to try a lunge to stop him.
Ruggles responded to the touchdown with a 48-yard field goal for Ohio State. Two minutes, 43 seconds to go, and Georgia, the reigning champion, was down by 6 in Atlanta.
This was not a game where many fans were leaving. (Theatrics aside, if you had paid what some of them did to get in -- a mortgage payment or more -- you might have been hard-pressed to leave, too, no matter the score.) The stadium, where Georgia had crushed two opponents this season, stayed awash in red, scarlet and hoarseness. The Peach Bowl, they were reasonably certain, would prove a lot better than the Peach Drop, a local New Year's Eve celebration.
The Bulldogs navigated deep into Ohio State territory. On second and 5, the ball rested on the 10 as the largest crowd in the stadium's history thundered as if championship ambitions depended on a single minute, which they did.
Mitchell lined up close to Georgia's sideline and took off as Bennett bounced backward. Mitchell zipped past a defender, cutting toward the middle of the field. Bennett passed. Mitchell, now in the end zone, cut back toward his sideline. Georgia's band loomed nearby.
He caught the touchdown. Jack Podlesny kicked the extra point for the 42-41 lead.
Ohio State had 54 seconds for its final drive. The Buckeyes reached Georgia's 32, helped greatly by a scramble from Stroud for 27 yards.
"We had done our job, and then we trusted the defense," Bennett said. "Then at that point, it was up to, I guess, the kicker."
It was, in fact, up to Ohio State's kicker.
Ruggles trotted out. Midnight approached. He took aim.
He and Ohio State got only anguish.

Gilgeous-Alexander eventually landed at the University of Kentucky, where coach John Calipari knew he needed to be tough on him. Otherwise, Calipari was going to hear about it — from Gilgeous-Alexander’s mother, Charmaine Gilgeous, a former Olympic runner for Antigua and Barbuda.
“When he played well, she would call me and say, ‘Don’t you let up on him,’” Calipari said.
Gilgeous-Alexander had arrived at Kentucky with a hitch in his jump shot — Calipari compared it to Charles Barkley’s herky-jerky golf swing — and spent the early weeks of the season mostly coming off the bench. By the middle of that January, he was blossoming as a starter. By that June, he was the 11th overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, headed to the Los Angeles Clippers.
Gilgeous-Alexander played so well as a rookie that the Thunder put him on their wish list. That summer, when All-Star Paul George wanted to be traded to the Clippers from Oklahoma City, the Thunder insisted that Gilgeous-Alexander be included in the deal.
Now in his fourth season with the Thunder, Gilgeous-Alexander is the face of a franchise that should come equipped with training wheels. Although Chet Holmgren, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2022 draft, is out for the season with a foot injury, the Thunder have a core that includes Josh Giddey, 20, and Luguentz Dort, 23. Even amid his emergence, Gilgeous-Alexander has never sought to separate himself from his teammates.
“I might have sworn at Lu before,” Gilgeous-Alexander said, “but me and Lu lived together, and we’re like brothers, so it doesn’t count.”
Gilgeous-Alexander and Dort, who are also teammates on the Canadian men’s national basketball team, are candid about their bromance. When Gilgeous-Alexander was vaccinated against the coronavirus, Dort held his hand. (Gilgeous-Alexander is afraid of needles.) When they were roommates, Dort accepted the perils of sharing space with someone who was recently voted GQ magazine’s Most Stylish Man of the Year.
“I don’t want to say his clothes are everywhere,” Dort said. “But he has a lot of clothes — clothes that have a lot of volume to them.”
But although life in the NBA is rewarding — Gilgeous-Alexander is in the first year of a five-year contract extension worth about $180 million — it can also be disorienting. So he dodges complacency as if it were a traffic cone, supplementing his time with the team by working with Olin Simplis, a high-profile skills coach.
And, of course, he heads to Hamilton at the start of each offseason to work out with friends who neither expect nor ask for anything in return.
‘Just Something That Friends Do’
After his first season in Oklahoma City, Gilgeous-Alexander wanted to make his summers more structured. So he hit up his buddies: Would they help him out five mornings a week?
“It wasn’t even something that needed to be said,” said Campbell, who works full-time at a Kids Foot Locker and assists with a girls basketball league. “It was just something that friends do: If we want to see this guy grow and succeed, we need to be there for him no matter what.”
Last summer, Gilgeous-Alexander would text his friends a few minutes before 7 a.m. to let them know that he was leaving his house — his hoops-centric version of flashing the Bat-Signal.
“You get that text, and you know you have about 15 minutes to get ready,” said Chu, a student at Toronto Metropolitan University.
Gilgeous-Alexander would retrieve his friends, one by one, in his pale brown Mercedes-Benz G-Class. Castillanes was typically the first stop.
“He always got the front seat,” Chu said.
Once assembled, they often had enough time during the ride to Burlington to cram in a homespun version of “Carpool Karaoke.” In June, Jack Harlow’s album “Come Home the Kids Miss You” was on repeat. By July, they were tearing through Burna Boy’s latest tracks.
“It’s a refreshing start to the day to see all your friends,” Chu said, “even when you’re mad tired.”
At the gym, they would warm up and stretch, then Gilgeous-Alexander would polish his shooting for about an hour as his friends rebounded for him. He usually filled the second hour with drills — footwork, defense, passing — before transitioning into half-court games of 3-on-3 with a lopsided feel.
“Shai takes all the shots,” Campbell said.
His court work complete, Gilgeous-Alexander would drop his friends off so he could lift weights — in another buddy’s two-car garage. Nem Ilic, 27, who describes his work as “athlete development,” spent last summer building Gilgeous-Alexander’s lower body: lunges in the garage, weighted sled pushes in the cul-de-sac out front. (The neighbors always knew when Gilgeous-Alexander was around.)
“Guys in my position, you usually have to work your way up from high school to college to the pros,” Ilic said. “And I have a unique timeline. It went straight to Shai.”
In their own way, the friends are a part of it all.
“I think the NBA is so crazy that he wants to come here and feel grounded,” Chu said, “and we’re all so grounded up here that we want to hear about NBA life.”
They can see Gilgeous-Alexander’s progress — and feel it, too, whenever they try to defend him on those early summer mornings.
“I want to say it’s never really that much of a fun time,” Campbell said.
They have busy lives of their own. Montoya, for example, manages a Hamilton-area restaurant. Castillanes recently relocated to Oklahoma City after Gilgeous-Alexander asked him if he would help manage his day-to-day life. And Kong works in public health while he prepares for medical school.
“You know how they say commitment will pay off if you improve by 1% every day? It’s something you see in real time with Shai,” Kong said. “And it’s something I can apply to my own life.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.
