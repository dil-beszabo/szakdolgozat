Full text: A younger generation discovers the appeal of wearing skins.
In March, Brandon Mahler took a pair of thrifted leather pants and spliced them into shorts. Holding the results, Mr. Mahler, a fashion consultant in New York, had to acknowledge that he'd crossed the line of sartorial sanity.
"When are you wearing leather shorts?" Mr. Mahler said, speaking with a Hyde-like clarity about this Jekyll-esque tailoring experiment. "They don't make sense."
On other leather items, Mr. Mahler, 33, doesn't hesitate. He owns three pairs of leather pants, several leather jackets and a prized Zegna leather blazer that called out to him at a secondhand store like a lustrous needle in the cotton haystack.
"Maybe it's this rebel bad boy thing," he said of his tendency to dress like an oil slick.
Mr. Mahler typifies a cohort of men -- often younger, yes, but also unbothered by the material's many clichés -- that have leaned into leather.
There's Shaboozey, the country-rap warbler who appeared on "Saturday Night Live" this month outfitted in leather from his boots to his bolo tie; Timothée Chalamet, putting a fine point on his rocker pivot by wearing a black leather Prada blazer on the "A Complete Unknown" red carpet; and the Memphis Grizzlies player Jaren Jackson Jr., who arrived at a recent game in inky leather pants and a matching leather tank top.
In stores, glossy options are available at all price points. Bottega Veneta's $ 6,700 made-ya-look calfskin shirt is printed to look like pedestrian flannel. Zara's oversize "leather blazer" sells for $ 139 though it's polyester. Somewhere in between are Supreme's $ 498 baggy leather pants.
Still, leather is one of those tripwire fabrics in men's fashion. To wear it is to face that you will look like you're doing a thing. Even men who clothe themselves in hides concede that there is a theatricality to the look.
"It's been hard for me to find a leather jacket that feels like it's not totally a costume," said Albert Muzquiz, 29, a fashion content creator in Los Angeles who posts under the name @EdgyAlbert.
Women, more conditioned to trying trends, are freer to toy with leather. It is unlikely that a woman in a leather blazer would be called Donnie Brasco. Men, as more than one source noted for this article, cannot skirt that same fate.
"Men don't want to be a caricature," said Savannah Yarborough, the designer of Savas, a leather specialty label with stores in Nashville and Los Angeles. In the past year, Ms. Yarborough has introduced $ 2,600 leather pants cut like five-pocket jeans and created full leather suits for clients. Her most "strange to witness" request, she said, was a zip-up leather hoodie, though she has now sold a number of them. (Wearing leather, of course, can be a base signifier that you spent money.)
"There's a sense of someone needing to give men permission because they're afraid that they may look like they're trying to be something," Ms. Yarborough said.
Savas also manufactured Mr. Muzquiz's ideal leather jacket: a raven-black blazer with peak lapels. He described the jacket as a sort of armor. "I often wear this one to clout-y L.A. events that I probably shouldn't really be invited to," he said.
Wearing it also makes him think of Brian De Palma's porn-industry thriller "Body Double," one of a number of '80s films -- erotic and otherwise -- to feature a leather-blazered main character. "There's just a real sexiness" to the glossy jacket, Mr. Muzquiz said.
The more you talk to men about leather, the more you realize their touch points can vary.
Some offer Leonardo DiCaprio's cigar-brown leather jacket from "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" as a template. Others propose the cast of "The Matrix," photos of which are regurgitated today on Y2K-worshiping Instagram accounts. A few nod to the gay subculture captured in the work of the artist Tom of Finland, though the mainstreaming of the leather trend has done much to mute those homoerotic overtones.
The leather hall of fame balloons with names like the Starchitect Peter Marino, who CBS News said dresses like a "bouncer at a leather bar"; Elvis Presley, who played his 1968 comeback special in a glossy leather suit; and John Shaft in his imposing black leather trench.
Leather detractors had their feelings captured in "The Leather Man," a much watched 2002 "Saturday Night Live" skit in which a leathered-up salesman played by Jimmy Fallon tried to sell a customer on venturing into the gloss. "Nothing's sexier than a pair of capri pants made from rattlesnakes," he implored. Nothing's squeakier either per the sketch, which had Mr. Fallon lumbering through the store, his outfit whining like a trapped mouse with each step.
Squeaks are trivial to Bryce Lennon, 37, a cartographer and part-time fashion blogger in Lumberton, N.J., who recently snatched up a boxy leather blazer at Goodwill. "I have an Afro, so it's giving 1970s," Mr. Lennon said. He can be swayed to the full leather look (the "Finnish tuxedo," if you will), but only if the shades match.
"The blacks have to go together, or it's just not gonna look right," he said.
The secondhand provenance of Mr. Lennon's blazer is pivotal to explaining how leather has gained traction again for young men. "We're going to these thrift stores, finding these pieces for $ 15, $ 20, and falling in love with them," said Raj Modi, a corporate analyst in Chicago who recently located a classic black leather blazer at a thrift store for $ 15.
This is a real-world example of fashion trend cycles at work: middle-aged men clean out their closets, including those leather jackets that they long ago downgraded from suave to sleazy. Those jackets land at thrift stores on the cheap where a new generation sees them as novel, even covetable.
"It's a little oversize," Mr. Modi, 24, said of his jacket. "It's got the shoulder pads." In it, he said: "I feel so freaking cool. There's no other way to explain it."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Andic got his start by selling T-shirts in Barcelona in the mid-1980s. He died in a fall during a hike.
Isak Andic, who built the fashion brand Mango from a Spanish storefront into a global giant with more than 2,000 stores on five continents, died in a fall while hiking near Barcelona on Saturday. He was 71.
The death was announced by Toni Ruiz, the chief executive of Mango. The cause was confirmed by Glòria Torrent Caldas, a spokeswoman for the company.
Mr. Andic, bespectacled and seen as relatively reclusive, started Mango in the mid-1980s by selling T-shirts in Barcelona. Over four decades, Mango grew into one of Spain's leading international retailers, known for its creative, eclectic and ever-changing selection of affordable women's wear.
Mr. Andic, who held the title of nonexecutive chairman at Mango, had a net worth of about $ 4.5 billion at his death, according to Forbes magazine.
Mango expanded beyond Spain in 1992 and opened its first U.S. location, in Los Angeles, in 2006. By 2008, it had launched a menswear line and opened an 8,000-square-foot store in the SoHo section of Manhattan. It held its first fashion show outside Spain in 2011.
Mango's success, in part based on a nimble approach that involved frequently replacing its merchandise, led to its growth in more than 100 markets. Over the years, it has received some scrutiny for safety lapses along its supply chain.
This year, Mango expanded its footprint in the United States, opening locations for the first time in Pennsylvania and in Washington, D.C. The company, which competes with fast fashion chains such as the Swedish-based H&M and the Spanish-based Zara, plans to have 40 American stores at year's end, up from 10 in 2022.
Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, was among the country's leaders who paid tribute to Mr. Andic. Isak Andic Ermay was born in 1953 in Istanbul. He moved with his family to Barcelona as a teenager and worked in the wholesale and retail sectors before opening Mango.
Jonathan Andic, his son, is an executive board member at Mango. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.

Full text: For holiday party season, easy ballerinas and Mary Janes that catch the light.
In T's column 1 Piece, 10 Budgets, we share 10 perfect versions of an item in a range of prices. Few accessories feel as festive as a glittering ballet shoe, and designers have shown plenty of them recently. Here are T market editor Angela Koh's favorites.
1. Zara, $ 60
"For the majority of us who don't have $ 1,600 to spend on, say, Loewe's rhinestone-adorned flats, Zara's iteration is a close alternative at a more accessible price."
2. Free People, $ 98
"These mesh flats shimmer thanks to metallic stitching, rather than rhinestones, which gives them a slightly subtler sparkle."
3. Madewell, $ 168
"Madewell's crystal-covered Mary Janes feature the brand's signature cushioned foot bed, making them comfortable enough to wear all day."
4. Loeffler Randall, $ 295
"The independent New York-based brand Loeffler Randall produces its pieces in small batches with meticulous attention to detail; the crystal embellishments on these flats are applied by hand."
5. Tory Burch, $ 348
"Who better to turn to for ballet flats than the designer Tory Burch? Her instantly recognizable 'T' emblem shoes debuted with her brand in 2004 and have become a modern classic."
6. Emme Parsons, $ 495
"The designer Emme Parsons takes a minimalist approach and avoids following trends, which means her pieces remain versatile staples for years."
7. Repetto, $ 530
"Founded in 1947 by the mother of a choreographer, the French footwear company Repetto has become synonymous with both ballet shoes and comfort -- each pair is built to have a flexible, glovelike fit."
8. MCM, $ 690
"These flats from the German brand MCM are similarly supple and slipper-like, but with crystals in a dramatic gradient arrangement."
9. Amina Muaddi, $ 1,560
"The designer Amina Muaddi's unapologetically glamorous accessories offer a bold counterpoint to the quiet luxury trend. The crystals on these suede flats are shaped like tiny hearts."
10. Santoni, $ 1,850
"The Italian shoe brand Santoni began in 1975 as a small family-run workshop and is still known for its artistry. The company's black suede flats stand out not only for their shine but also for their craftsmanship."

NEW YORK — Even when Monica Martino was “broke and couldn’t afford anything,” she loved roaming the stalls at New York City’s holiday markets.
“I used to walk around and just think it must be so magical for these people to be out here in these little jewel boxes selling their stuff,” she said.
Now Martino, 53, sits in a jewel box herself. Six years ago, she started a business, Lemon Zesty, making tote bags and other items printed with sassy images of her own creation. (She calls it “fresh art with a sour twist.”) This year, she was selling her wares in a stall at the Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Park, one of New York’s largest seasonal markets, with some 4 million visitors.
Black Friday marks the start of the holiday shopping season, traditionally observed with tightly crowded, bargain-hunting trips to big retailers and department stores.
But in holiday markets, small businesses are the focus, said Evan Shelton, senior vice president of Urbanspace, which hosts holiday markets in New York City. The company oversees outdoor markets, including in Bryant Park, Columbus Circle and the Union Square Holiday Market, which started in 1993 and is the longest-running market in the city. This year, Urbanspace also coordinated an indoor market at Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street for the first time in its 166-year history.
The shopping bonanza that is called Black Friday now starts well before Thanksgiving and continues with online sales through Cyber Monday (though, of course, there will be holiday sales up until Christmas). The Saturday that follows Black Friday became known as Small Business Saturday in 2010, and consumers are encouraged to shop at small and local businesses. It’s also one of the core days of the holiday market season, Shelton said.
Martino does about 80% to 90% of her sales for the year during the holiday markets, so she pours hours of work into gearing up for this exact moment. Whether she’ll experience a Black Friday bump as she has in past years remains to be seen. But, Martino noted, “everyone in the world comes to this part of town, so I’m expecting it to be busy .”
As soon as this year is over, she’ll “hibernate” for the rest of January before beginning preparations for the 2025 holiday shopping season.
“The economy matters less than the weather,” Eldon Scott, president of Urbanspace, said of the outdoor markets. “People tend to come out and want to be at the market.”
It was a rainy day in November when Allison Larimore stepped into Martino’s booth, drawn by her quirky art.
“It’s my sense of humor, and it reminded me of a friend back home, so I bought her a gift,” Larimore said.
Visiting New York from Seattle, Larimore, a research nurse who also makes handmade surgical scrub caps, said she liked to go in and out of the booths, asking vendors if they were the artists behind the products.
It “just makes it a little bit more wholesome,” she said. “More important to spend my money there.”
A Small-Business Laboratory
Holiday markets, commonly held outdoors under twinkling lights, have long provided small businesses with a boost and customers with a festive experience.
“Shopping around the holidays should be experiential because people are into it,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
“Even Santa Claus is an experiential thing,” she said. “The Thanksgiving Day parade, holiday music — it all puts you in the mood. And holiday markets, I think, are part of that.”
At Bryant Park, there is ice skating, a large holiday tree and cozy igloos, in addition to roughly 200 vendors. About 30% of them sell food, and the rest are hawking a variety of items made for gifting, including jewelry, socks, handbags, clothing and home goods.
The number of holiday shops at the park has grown steadily in the 23 years since the market’s inception, said Irene Vagianos Whelan, vice president of brand partnerships and events at Bryant Park.
Most of the shops are small businesses, she said, noting that many owners even started their businesses at the park. Bank of America, which teams up with the park to host the annual winter extravaganza, gives four minority-owned businesses with less than $1 million in revenue rent-free spaces in the market for two weeks during its peak season.
“We really try to launch their business,” Vagianos Whelan said. “We’ve had a couple of them turn into real vendors in the market.”
Rent varies for the other vendors, she said, but everybody is generally on a percentage deal, “so if the vendor does well, we do well. If the vendor doesn’t do well, they don’t suffer.” (Neither she nor Urbanspace would offer specifics about rent or entry costs.)
Lisa Devo, a co-owner of the Soap & Paper Factory, which is based in Nyack, New York, has sold her fragrant wares at holiday markets for years. She also sells her goods at retailers (Barnes & Noble, Paper Source and others), but the markets let her meet customers in the flesh.
“I love selling because I love people,” she said, adding, “When our customers come in, we hug. It’s so nice, and they want to see us succeed, and they want to support local business .”
Holiday markets make up about 20% of her sales for the year, Devo said, giving her the space to experiment with new items.
“It is very, very helpful for me to be here and look at what people are asking for, and talk to people about what they want,” she said. Roughly 80% of vendors return to Urbanspace’s markets, Shelton, the company’s senior vice president, said.
For Luca Meacci, owner of Casa Toscana, a Tuscan eatery, holiday markets provided a lifeline during the coronavirus pandemic. His two storefronts in New York City, which relied on office workers and tourists, had to close. But a booth at the Bryant Park market in 2020 allowed him to stay in business. Meacci, 42, now has two shops again and booths in several of Urbanspace’s holiday markets.
“Without the holiday market, I wouldn’t be able to be here,” he said, standing outside his booth inside Macy’s. “I’m very grateful for it.”
‘The Tree, the Vibes, It’s So Cozy’
Suzanne Kanj and her sister, Nina, were visiting the Bryant Park market on a rainy Friday night when they stopped into Devo’s booth, calling its scent “magnetic.”
The sisters, who live in New York City and have visited the market for the past five years, said they come to eat the pasta that’s made by another vendor in a Parmesan wheel and to drink hot chocolate.
“The tree, the vibes, it’s so cozy,” Kanj said.
A few booths away, Sasha Sherman and his team were roasting chestnuts in an electric oven (no open fire here). A man on a mission, Sherman, 35, is trying to revive the American chestnut treats by instilling a taste for them in customers.
During late fall and winter, he ships boxes of chestnuts harvested in Ohio and upstate New York — some 10,000 pounds this year — to purchasers around the country. His business, the Great Chestnut Experiment, has a number of pop-ups and other markets under its belt, but this is its first time at Bryant Park.
Sherman and his team dole out fresh roasted chestnuts and baked goods like chestnut swirled brownies and chestnut brown butter cakes. If it’s your first time ever having a chestnut, you get to ring a bell.
Holiday markets are the best place to bring chestnuts back into American culture, Sherman said, because, “fundamentally, chestnuts are, throughout the world, a food that is traditionally consumed around the holidays.” That time of year, he said, is “when they peak in their flavor.”

Luxury Giant's Fund Invests in a Cult Fashion Brand: [Style Desk]

Full text: The Swedish brand Our Legacy finally gets investment from LVMH.
LVMH Luxury Ventures Fund, the venture capital arm of Bernard Arnault's towering luxury empire, has acquired a minority stake in the insidery Swedish fashion brand Our Legacy.
To men's fashion zealots of a particular vintage, Our Legacy is now the little Scandinavian brand that could -- with the LVMH co-sign to prove it.
"All of a sudden we're a bigger brand at a different, new level," said Jockum Hallin, one of Our Legacy's co-founders.
"Its brand image is very cult," said Julie Bercovy, the chief executive of LVMH Luxury Ventures Advisors. Our Legacy, she said, is "under the radar, but on our radar."
Mr. Bercovy said the fund was compelled by Our Legacy's recent financial performance, as well as its strong brand identity, which she described as "quiet hype," a youthful twist on the quiet luxury trend.
The terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but Ms. Bercovy said that the investment was in line with the fund's previous investments, which are as much as $ 25 million for as much as 25 percent of a company. The investment stands to give Our Legacy a significant leg up, both financially and reputationally.
Founded in 2005 by Mr. Hallin, his childhood friend Cristopher Nying and Richardos Klarén, the brand's early collections had a whispery Scandinavian prep look, marked by belted cardigans and unobtrusive checked button-ups.
Our Legacy unfurled its freak flag over the next two decades. Key items today include its wry trompe l'oeil printed jeans; shrunken to-the-waist sweaters; and square-toed Camion boots (worn by celebrities like Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns, and endlessly recommended by men's fashion TikTokers).
Our Legacy's avant-minimalist clothes may owe much to Helmut Lang and Martin Margiela, but it's priced in the shrinking middle of the men's fashion market. At around $ 600 for those boots and $ 400 for jeans, Our Legacy's clothes are far more costly than Zara but still below the Guccis of the world.
Customers seem to be gravitating toward that middle ground.
"The last couple of years, the growth of Our Legacy has been way more rapid than the first 16," Mr. Hallin said. Between 2020 and 2023 sales doubled year over year. The 19-year-old brand is now stocked at around 250 stores globally, with flagship locations in Stockholm, London, Berlin and Seoul, and earns $ 40 million in revenue annually. Our Legacy is frequently, and fervently, name-checked on Instagram by 20- and 30-something men's fashion fanboys and the bro-y fashion podcast Throwing Fits.
Its profile has also been raised through collaborations with brands ranging from egalitarian streetwear (Stussy and Tremaine Emory's Denim Tears) to the Italian haute (Emporio Armani). Mr. Hallin acknowledged that these at times surprising partnerships probably nudged the brand onto LVMH's radar. "That's been something that's gained more eyes on us," he said.
As for LVMH, the investment is yet another signal that the giant behind Dior and Louis Vuitton is diversifying its holdings beyond luxury. It also comes during a critical juncture for the broader conglomerate: Last month, LVMH reported that its sales fell 3 percent from a year earlier, a decline driven in large part by slipping sales in the highly important Chinese market.
Ms. Bercovy stressed that the fund is "very autonomous" from the broader LVMH portfolio. "It's not like there's a lack in the group for men's wear, for Gen-Zs for instance, and we go for this," she said. Still, Ms. Bercovy said that Our Legacy's fan base, as well as its palatable price point made it an attractive investment.
"It's maybe for a younger generation which is obviously great, because as you know, the sector in fashion and luxury is of course driven by a new generation in terms of growth," she said. As a minority investor LVMH Ventures will get a board seat at Our Legacy, but she said the company will "remain fully autonomous from a pure vision standpoint, from a pure operational standpoint."
In choosing LVMH Ventures as a partner, Our Legacy's founders were reassured by its past investments in growing brands like Gabriela Hearst and especially Aimé Leon Dore, a New York label spanning the streetwear-luxury divide.
Mr. Hallin said he was swayed by the relatively hands-off approach that LVMH laid out, which he described as "observing" more than directing. "They said that they don't want us to change basically anything, just continue doing beautiful stuff," he added.
At Our Legacy, the funding will be earmarked, in large part, for territorial expansion. "We'll gain some muscle to be able to open stores," Mr. Hallin said. He added that he would like to open one or two Our Legacy stores a year, including in Paris, New York and Tokyo.
The investment will also allow the brand to scale up the women's wear line it introduced six years ago. "We have a beautiful team, but we can only do so much at once," said Mr. Hallin, who said around 35 people work in Our Legacy's corporate office. The women's line represents about 20 percent of Our Legacy's overall business.
A runway show, the sort of splashy spectacle that LVMH's core fashion brands have mastered, also wasn't out of the question. As Mr. Hallin said, "We're getting a little push in the back to get out in the world a little bit more."
With these possibilities, he believes that Our Legacy could be a $ 100 million business. "If we're not in that size within some years, like say three to five years," Mr. Hallin said, "something has stopped working."

A 'Real Housewife' Hits the Town: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Early on a Monday evening during New York Fashion Week, Jessel Taank breezed into the Sabyasachi boutique in the West Village, passing a life-size elephant sculpture near the sidewalk. But the "Real Housewives of New York City" star couldn't quite say what it was doing there.
"Good question," she said with a laugh. "There's apparently a great elephant migration that I wasn't aware happens this time of year, and Sabyasachi is celebrating that tonight."
In fact, The Great Elephant Migration is a touring art installation featuring a herd of 100 faux pachyderms, handcrafted in Tamil Nadu from a dried invasive shrub. (Actual Indian elephant migration in India happens year-round.)
Such obliviousness to details seems on brand for Ms. Taank, 41. After all, who could forget when she called TriBeCa "up and coming" on the last season of the "Real Housewives of New York City"?
But when she commits these faux pas, she does so with a disarming smile, one that has won over prickly fans. By the end of the show's 14th season -- and the first of the cast reboot -- it was clear that she had received the villain edit, criticized for what came off as willful ignorance and bratty behavior. But she had also found a fan base so ardent that, according to Rolling Stone, its members call themselves "Taank Tops."
Her second season premieres on Oct. 1 (giving East Coast viewers the choice between watching the show or the vice-presidential debate).
That Monday evening Ms. Taank was accompanied by her husband, Pavit Randhawa, who joined her for the party hosted by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the Indian couturier and a sponsor of the art installation. "I'm here for the food," Mr. Randhawa, 44, explained.
As Ms. Taank, a fashion publicist and founder of Oushq, an e-commerce platform bringing emerging Indian designers stateside, paused every few steps to distribute air kisses and exchange peals of laughter, Mr. Randhawa, a tech start-up strategist and "Real Housewives" fan favorite, kept an eye trained on the servers swirling past with chicken samosas and bite-size fish tacos.
"He's, like, having dinner," Ms. Taank said drolly. Such jabs have become part of their brand as a couple. Passing one appetizer station, the couple paused to do caviar bumps.
"Ah, there's Mr. Mukherjee!" Ms. Taank swanned over to say hello to the designer, her black and gold Zimmerman gown billowing in her wake.
"Oh, is that the main guy?" Mr. Randhawa asked someone nearby.
On "Real Housewives," Ms. Taank's background and marriage became fodder for on-camera speculation. On the first season, the other housewives regularly gossip that she was not forthcoming enough with her personal history, but it's relatively straightforward: Her parents grew up in Kenya with roots in Gujarat, India; during volatility in East Africa in the 1960s and '70s, they immigrated to London, where Ms. Taank and her brother, Bobby, a music producer, were born. Her father was an accountant, and her mother worked in child care and retail.
In 2006, after graduating from King's College London, she joined her uncles Nitin Vadukul and Max Vadukul (whose son, Alex Vadukul, is a reporter for The New York Times's Styles section), both well-known photographers, in New York. Her own career in fashion public relations has included stints working for Celine and Victoria Beckham and in-house at Michael Kors.
Finding her way to the back of the boutique, Ms. Taank ran into Mickey Boardman, the former editorial director of Paper Magazine, who had made a cameo on the show last season during a party at her home. "Have you met Mickey?" she asked her husband.
"Yeah, he was at our house," Mr. Randhawa answered. The two men had been discussing Mr. Randhawa's unconventional method of remembering which glass was his at that gathering.
He clarified: "You go to this kind of thing, and everyone's drinking champagne, and you're like 'Which one's my champagne?' No one's going to put a carrot in their champagne, right?"
Ms. Taank rolled her eyes. "This was a cocktail party with a lot of high-profile fashion editors, and he's walking around with a bloody carrot in his champagne."
"I never lost my drink that night," Mr. Randhawa retorted.
The couple met in New York, and they were friends and then roommates before they started dating. Ms. Taank asked him out in 2012, she said, and soon after, "I think I proposed to him."
They had been dating for a year when, in 2013, Michael Kors's human resources asked if she had a plan for after her visa expired in three months. "Oh, yes, I'm getting married," she remembered replying, before calling Mr. Randhawa, who grew up in Los Angeles, to inform him of this development.
They soon eloped at City Hall in Manhattan -- after which she went back to work while he went out day drinking with his friend who had served as witness -- and a much grander celebration in Mexico, covered by Vogue, followed in 2014.
Ms. Taank had somehow managed to avoid seeing a single episode of any "Real Housewives" franchise, she said, before joining the cast. "I knew I'd make good TV because I'm a lunatic, and so is Pavit."
That other "lunatic" pulled out his phone to summon an Uber home to their twins, Kai and Rio. "What's this place called?" he asked. Ms. Taank looked at him in disbelief, before yanking at an embroidered jacket nearby: "It's on every hanger in the store."
Ms. Taank still styles herself. That evening, she paired her caftan-like gown with a petite Yves Saint Laurent bag; gold Alexis Bittar earrings; and simple Gianvito Rossi stilettos. She left Mr. Randhawa to his own devices, giving him the guidance that Sabyasachi was "the Chanel of India."
"He was like, 'That's a lot of pressure,"' she said. "So he comes out, does a twirl, and was like, 'What do you think Sabyasachi would say if he knew I was wearing Zara and H&M?"'
After Mr. Randhawa went home, Ms. Taank headed to a bar at the Warren Street Hotel in, yes, TriBeCa -- "Look at it, it's so up and coming, it's so buzzing!" she quipped -- for a quiet moment before her next event.
Though she'd started her own P.R. consultancy while filming the show's first season, during fashion week she often finds herself to be of interest as much as her clients. "All of a sudden you're talent and not a publicist," she said.
While waiting for the spicy margarita she had ordered, she hopped behind the bar to help the bartender, a man named Anthony Baker, with the other bar tabs to speed things along.
Soon she was free-pouring a batched tequila mixture for a Daisy Clementine, the bar's signature drink. "Whoa!" Mr. Baker stopped her. "We have to measure it out!"
"Oh, was that alcohol?" she asked innocently.
Ms. Taank grabbed a pair of tweezers and gently crowned the glass with a slice of orange before passing it on. "Tell them Jessel Taank of 'Real Housewives' made their drink!"
A few minutes later, spicy margarita in hand, she settled into a colorful couch to discuss the forthcoming season. "It is definitely the best type of mirror, because I noticed my tone is a little bit abrasive," she said. "When I look at Pavit and what he does for us, I really do take for granted having a husband that's so supportive. On the show you see me being kind of dismissive to him sometimes, but I really have focused on making sure that I prioritize our relationship."
After all the hate she received at first, was she nervous about coming back for more?
Not in the least, she said. "I'm not a one-hit wonder."

Millions in the Path of Flooding in Africa, and Over 1,000 Are Dead: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Flooding caused by heavy rains has left more than 1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed.
Aishatu Bunu, an elementary schoolteacher in Maiduguri, a city in Nigeria's northeast, woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of her neighbors shouting.
When she opened her front door, she was greeted by the sight of rising waters outside. "We saw -- water is coming," Ms. Bunu said.
In a panic, she and her three young children grabbed some clothes and her educational certificates and fled their home into waters that quickly became chest high, eventually finding temporary shelter at a gas station.
Ms. Bunu was speaking on Friday from the bed of a truck that she managed to board with her children after several days of sheltering at various sites across the flood-stricken city. The floodwaters inundated Maiduguri early last week after heavy rainfall caused a nearby dam to overflow.
Flooding caused by the rain has devastated cities and towns across west and central Africa in recent days, leaving more than 1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed. Up to four million people have been affected by the floods and nearly one million forced to flee their homes, according to humanitarian agencies.
The exact number of deaths has been difficult to tally given the scale of the disaster, and the officially reported figures are not up-to-date. In Nigeria, the authorities said that at least 200 people had died, but that was before the floods hit Maiduguri, which has added at least 30 people to that toll. In Niger, more than 265 have been reported dead. In Chad, 487 people had lost their lives as of last week. In Mali, which is facing its worst floods since the 1960s, 55 died.
The first night after they fled their home, Ms. Bunu said she and her children, Zara, Ahmed and Fatima, slept in a gas station. The next morning, they sought shelter in the grounds of a research institute, where they stayed for two days, sleeping in the open, surrounded by water.
Apart from a few peanuts, they had no food. Ms. Bunu said she did not think she would survive.
Scenes of devastation could be seen across Maiduguri on Friday. Dead people and animals floated past. People were trapped in schools and on rooftops. Some slept on the highway.
Over the weekend, many people were rescued across the city after being trapped by the floodwaters for days. The ground floor of the main hospital was submerged, destroying vital equipment, samples and the polio laboratory.
Rising waters swept crocodiles and deadly snakes out of the zoo and into communities, while 80 percent of the zoo's animals drowned, according to a statement from Ali Don Best, the general manager of the Borno State Museum Park, where the zoo is.
In Nigeria and in most of the region, the floods are hitting communities already racked by conflict, displacement and poverty. Even worse flooding is forecast for later in the year.
Although Africa produces only a fraction of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, Africans bear an exceptionally heavy burden from climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
And adapting to it will cost sub-Saharan Africa $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion annually over the next decade, or 2 to 3 percent of the region's gross domestic product, it said.
"The impact of climate change is what we're witnessing right now," said Olasunkanmi Okunola, a scientist whose study focuses on flood risk management and climate adaptation. "There's no way we can prevent major disasters from happening, but there are steps we can take to lessen the effect."
He pointed to early warning systems and improving countries' infrastructure, like drainage systems and roads.
In the Sahel, the arid strip just south of the Sahara, the problem is not usually an abundance of water, but lack of it. Decades of desertification and multiple failed rainy seasons have frequently led to drought.
That is the case in Zinder, a city in southern Niger, where last week a treasured historic mosque caved in as a result of heavy rains, captured in a resident's video.
"The collapse is a tragedy for all Muslims in Niger and around the world," said Macky Rabiou, an imam at the mosque, which was built in 1810.
Everybody in Zinder was grief-stricken, said Hakimin Fada, a worshiper at the mosque whose parents and grandparents had also prayed there.
"No one slept without feeling the pain," he said. "Although we acknowledge it as Allah's destiny, and we have to accept destiny, we can't help but feel profound sadness."
In neighboring Mali, Mariam Diallo, a housekeeper, said her family had spent nights trying to empty their house of water. They protected the grain they had for food, but "the water took all our shoes," she said.
Baba Faradji N'Diaye, an environmental expert based in Mali's capital, Bamako, said people had built everywhere, including in the river beds.
"Of course, it's a natural disaster, but it's also happened because of anarchic practices," he said. And the problem will only increase as the city's population does, he said.
"Everyone wants to move to Bamako," he said.
In Nigeria and across the region, there is a severe lack of funding to deal with the immense humanitarian crisis. In Nigeria, for instance, the United Nations has less than half of the $ 927 million it says it needs to save lives by providing food and clean water, and preventing disease.
As the floods lingered in Maiduguri, the only two bridges that link the city's eastern and western halves began to make strange noises. Cracks appeared.
Then, on Thursday one bridge collapsed, followed by the other on Friday, splitting the city in half with no access from one side to the other.
Half of Maiduguri is now underwater.
Friends and family members are trying to rescue one another, using canoes or trucks to access cutoff areas.
Ms. Bunu, the teacher, and her children were on one of those trucks on Friday, along with dozens of other women and children. They were all famished, having eaten barely anything since the floods hit.
As the truck made its way out of the waterlogged area in the pouring rain, a member of Nigeria's House of Representatives threw two loaves of bread to the people in the truck.
The women split the loaves among the children, giving each child a few mouthfuls.
From her spot on the bed of the truck, Ms. Bunu's head was bowed in thought. Occasionally, she looked up at the sky. She had no idea how her daughters from a previous marriage, who were staying with her sister, had fared. She tried calling but couldn't get through.
And the flood had swallowed the family's means of survival -- their sheep, goats and chickens -- as well as every household item they possessed.
"I don't have anything now," she said.
When they finally reached a camp, a nongovernmental organization gave them some water and food: half a can of sardines and half a loaf of bread per person.
It wasn't clear what would happen next.
Mamadou Tapily contributed reporting from Bamako, Mali; Amma Mossa from Zinder, Niger; and Elian Peltier from Dakar, Senegal.

Zac Posen's Mission? Reinvent the Gap.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Friday morning, just at the start of New York Fashion Week, more than 1,000 designers, models, factory workers, editors, retailers and influencers will gather in front of Macy's Herald Square and march up Broadway to Bryant Park to get out the vote. Most of them will be wearing the same thing: a white T-shirt (or T-shirt dress) with black letters that spell out the doodled slogan "Fashion for Our Future." The designer: Zac Posen, for Old Navy.
In other words, what is essentially a giant Old Navy show is going to be one of the first big events of New York Fashion Week.
"Crazy, right?" Mr. Posen said a few weeks earlier. He was bouncing on his toes in his glass-walled corner office at Gap Inc.'s headquarters in San Francisco, showing off a sample T-shirt. Crazy, he meant, that most of New York fashion would deign to don the same tee -- and crazy that it would be one of his.
After all, in 2019, Mr. Posen, former dauphin of New York fashion, protégé of Tom Ford, prince of the red carpet, became the cautionary tale of the industry: the hotshot who lost his way, his name and his brand, in the wilds of ego and private equity. Since then, he had been cobbling together a freelance collaboration here, a private commission there, to make ends meet. He was, professionally, off the radar.
So were Old Navy and its parent company, Gap Inc., the onetime avatar of cool Americana that had turned khakis and a white T-shirt into a billion-dollar behemoth once modeled by Joan Didion and LL Cool J. Overexpansion and excessive discounting had sent it on a 20-year decline, left behind by the fast-fashion giants Zara and H&M. A series of chief executives had promised turnarounds only to see sales slow and the stock fall ever farther. An ill-fated deal in 2020 with Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, left the company with egg on its face.
The group is still big -- last year's sales were $ 14.9 billion -- but it had become "just product," said Anna Wintour, the chief content officer of Condé Nast. "It had the name, it had the recognition, but there was no sense of excitement."
Then, in August 2023, Richard Dickson, Mattel's "Barbie" mastermind, was hired as chief executive. He decided that one of the problems with Gap was fear of taking risks. So he took one.
In February, he hired Mr. Posen to be chief creative officer of Old Navy and executive vice president and creative director of Gap Inc. The two newly created positions make Mr. Posen his "creative partner" overseeing products, advertising and stores for all Gap brands -- not just Old Navy but also Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta.
A man who had never managed more than 60 people was now helping to steer thousands of employees. A guy whose last gig was creating ball gowns for Ryan Murphy's recreation of the Truman Capote black and white ball in "Feud: Capote vs. the Swans" was going to turn his hand to basics.
"I certainly didn't see that coming," Ms. Wintour said.
The stakes are high for Mr. Posen and the company. The only thing pop culture loves more than an odd-couple story is a resurrection story. This has the potential to be both. But there is also a fine line between being relevant and being elitist. Get it wrong, and it could be a disaster.
"Just don't call it a comeback," Mr. Posen said.
From Tuxedos to Bluejeans
In any case, he is all in. He has traded his suits and tuxedos for jeans.
"When I met him, he was always wearing a suit," said Harrison Ball, Mr. Posen's fiancé, a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet. "He existed on a red carpet. That's what his company and his career demanded of him. I'm cleaning a 20-year-old storage unit right now. It's like, tuxedo, tuxedo, tuxedo, tuxedo."
During the early months of the pandemic, Mr. Ball said, Mr. Posen "started to wear jeans and took his shoes off and stopped styling his hair." According to Ms. Wintour, when he told her about his new job, his look was "full denim."
He hasn't entirely swapped New York for San Francisco -- Mr. Posen kept his Upper East Side apartment -- but he spends at least half his time in a new rental house on the bay. At 43, he still has the riot of dark curls that he had as a baby designer, the deep dimples and the Tom Ford-style stubble, but he looks a little more weathered around the eyes.
Mr. Ball found the house on Zillow. Four stories of wood and brick, it is set on a hill, with a red door and two widow's walks overlooking the bay. From the attic room, you can lie on an old iron bed, look directly out a window and see only water.
In the back, there is a garden where Mr. Posen grows jasmine, nightshades and nasturtiums. Next year, he said, he is planning to add "edibles" to the garden.
"Not those kinds of edibles," he said when a guest raised an eyebrow. He meant edible flowers. They are nice in a salad.
The couple commutes between San Francisco and New York. Mr. Posen is usually on an airplane; Mr. Ball, 31, drives back and forth with the couple's two miniature poodles: Tsuki, named after the Japanese word for moon, and Bizet, named for the composer. (Mr. Posen, a prototypical New Yorker, does not drive.)
When the couple met in 2020, Mr. Ball said, Mr. Posen had one poodle. "And I was like: 'Zac, I love you, baby, but I cannot be the dancer living with a fashion designer and a poodle. So your dog has to go live with your parents or something.' Then within two weeks, I started taking her to the theater, and I fell in love with her. And then I got another one."
The two got engaged two years ago, and they have gone through their career transitions together. Mr. Ball's last season with the ballet coincided with Mr. Posen's freelance period, and the designer came to every one of Mr. Ball's performances, sitting in the first ring in the seat that used to be George Balanchine's and making dinner for assorted dancers afterward.
"But I chose to leave," Mr. Ball said. "Zac didn't. He was forced to make that choice." It was, he said, "devastating."
'What Am I Doing Here?'
Mr. Posen prefers to think of his current job as another stage in his hero's journey, the one that took him from SoHo, where he was raised by an artist father and a lawyer mother; to St. Ann's School in Brooklyn, where he started dressing friends like Lola Schnabel and Jemima Kirke; to Central Saint Martins in London, holding his first fashion show at 21 and founding the House of Z, the name of the operating company that owned his brand.
His descent into Tartarus -- Mr. Posen is given to describing his trajectory in mythic terms -- came after years of struggling to build the business. In 2019, his private equity backer, Ronald Burkle's Yucaipa Companies, finally decided it was time for its exit and, after failing to find a buyer, wound down the House of Z, selling all of its intellectual property and archives. (Mr. Posen received nothing.) That was just before Covid restrictions put fashion on pause for months -- a dark period that prepared Mr. Posen to scale the heights, or at least the 15-story headquarters, of Gap Inc., with its soaring Richard Serra sculpture in the lobby, its "Gapeteria" (the employee canteen) and its views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Treasure Island.
"Everything has led to this," Mr. Posen said. "This" being his new office, and life, in San Francisco; "everything" being the multiple side gigs he took on to finance his own business that helped school him in accessibility. See his line with David's Bridal, his stint designing the uniforms for Delta Air Lines, his work as the head of Brooks Brothers women's wear and his six years as a judge on "Project Runway."
Even if, he said, Gap wasn't on his radar "at all." Even if he remembered thinking on his first day, "What am I doing here?"
Yet it was Mr. Posen's experience with failure that Mr. Dickson said was part of what attracted him to the designer when they first met at Balthazar in SoHo, over French fries and tea. Another plus: Mr. Posen's understanding of fit. (Memorably, Banana Republic once made a blazer with armholes too small for an average woman to wear.)
At that point, Mr. Posen and Mr. Ball had pretty much decided to move to Paris, and Mr. Posen had been interviewing for the designer gig at several French brands. He declined to say which ones, but gossip suggests Lanvin and Givenchy. Mr. Dickson was looking for a creative director for Old Navy, by far the largest Gap Inc. brand and, as the second largest apparel brand in the United States, with net sales of $ 8.2 billion last year, its financial engine. (Gap brand sales were $ 3.3 billion.)
After that conversation, both men were so excited that Mr. Posen persuaded Mr. Dickson to extend his remit to all of the Gap brands.
"I really appreciated that Zac had gone through very difficult periods of his career," Mr. Dickson said. It's the ability to handle both success and challenge that is critical, he said, "when you're in a leadership role at this level and scale." He said Mr. Posen was "humble," a word never much associated with the designer before.
Fashiontainment
"For fashion, you're supposed to be demure, and you're supposed to be cool and not that friendly, and then there's this guy who's so eager, like a puppy," Mr. Ball said. "That eagerness can come off as narcissism." Or hubris.
It often seemed as if Mr. Posen, whose story can seem like an improbable fashion version of "Zelig," was so enchanted by his own good fortune that he expected everyone else to be enchanted, too. He landed in London for college and immediately met Anita Pallenberg. An early show was partly underwritten by Mr. Ford and Domenico de Sole; they dressed him in Tom Ford suits. He said "Azzedine" (as in Alaïa) told him to go out on his own, and "Yohji" (as in Yamamoto) told him to move his show to Paris.
When asked about his wedding, he said that he and Mr. Ball were thinking of doing something small and quiet, at City Hall ... but then, he would also like a giant, "This Is Your Life"-style blowout with Bernadette Peters ("my first commission when I came back from Saint Martins") and Madonna performing, and guests like Liza Minnelli, Rihanna and Jennifer Hudson. He has stories about them all.
"I always felt more comfortable in the entertainment industry than in my own fashion industry," Mr. Posen said. He never won a designer of the year award, as he is quick to point out. His gowns often had a wowza Hollywood glamour that was more Cecil DeMille than Charles James.
Still, Mr. Posen is relentlessly positive. He said his time off had allowed him, for the first time in his career, to spend real time with his family (especially important after his mother's cancer diagnosis last year) and to get some crucial perspective on all the silly fashion stuff.
"Having your company closed and not knowing what to do after that much time is terrifying," he said. "People were writing things as if I had died. But I wouldn't have traded the opportunity and how this happened for anything in the world."
Jordan Roth, the theater producer, who has commissioned numerous opening-night looks from Mr. Posen, compared him to Willy Wonka, P.T. Barnum and Walt Disney, wrapped in one. Mr. Dickson called him the Pied Piper. Ms. Wintour said, "There's something very old-fashioned about him."
The irony is, Mr. Posen's affinity for a bit of unironic razzle-dazzle may have made fans of high-concept dress a little sniffy, but it makes him perfect for a company like Gap Inc. At this moment, as fashion segues into entertainment, he may actually have stumbled into his ideal job.
The Blue Glow
At Mr. Posen's office at Gap Inc., an entire wall is covered in printouts of what he has planned. On his desk is a new laptop with a yellow stickie note containing his name and password, a photo-booth printout of himself and Mr. Ball mugging at the Vanity Fair Oscar party and a bra from Athleta with a flexible underwire that he thought could be used as a base for draping an evening gown.
One of the first things Mr. Posen did when he arrived at Gap was work on a new blue. Actually, three new blues: an official Gap Inc. blue (the company is exploring its own Pantone shade); a Gap-brand blue, sort of between Yves Klein and cerulean; and an Old Navy "new navy," like "a good yacht." Mr. Posen could imagine the Gap-brand blue as a special light that will illuminate the stores at night so they have their own "blue glow." It could also be the color of new "Gapsicles" (a Gap ice pop) that could be sold in stores, with flavors like blue borage. This is the kind of "why not?" that is his happy place.
At Old Navy, he has been focusing on the details: party dresses cut high enough in the back to cover the bra strap, a ruffle added to an off-the-shoulder dress to cover the upper arms. The team bought back a few of his old evening gowns for reference, since he lost his archive. He says things like, "That color makes me depressed -- it's like the pea soup of teal," but in a nice way.
Oh, and he says, "I love brainstorming with all the brand C.E.O.s!"
He has enlisted Jacqueline Schnabel to help curate the Banana Republic stores, and Tonne Goodman, the Vogue sustainability editor, as a stylist on the campaigns. The first one starred Carolyn Murphy and the second, Lauren Hutton. ("I have to be honest, I was really surprised by the clothes," Ms. Goodman said. "The quality is excellent.")
Demi Moore, who once appeared in a Gap ad back when it was cool, wants to make another. Mr. Posen brought Gap to the Met Gala, on Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and made a white shirtdress for Anne Hathaway to wear to a Bulgari event. Though there was some critical pushback about his going the celebrity route, he sees it as being part of the cultural conversation -- and Gap history. Afterward, the Met Gala dress was displayed in the lobby of the Gap headquarters, and employees took selfies with it.
Mr. Posen is reveling in the fact that, after 20 years of running a business on a shoestring, he finally has resources. For him, Mr. Roth said, "commercial is not a limitation, it's an opportunity." He gets as animated about the technology that allows Old Navy teams to digitally sample a garment in 3-D, so there is no physical waste, as he did about double-face satin. He is planning to increase the internship program to create a pipeline of young designers from schools like Central Saint Martins, so that future hims consider Gap a potential career path, as they do LVMH.
He feels like the needle is moving. When he began approaching designers for collaborations, the answers, he said, were almost always: "Let's see. We're not ready for that. We love Zac, but we're not sure it's right for us." Now, he said, he has a slate of names lined up. The group's second-quarter results, released at the end of August, beat sales expectations. There may even be a full-fledged show next year. In the meantime, along with outfitting the fashion week march, Old Navy is also throwing a big 30th-anniversary bash during the New York collections.
The point is, Mr. Posen said, those Old Navy T-shirts (which are going to be sold in stores) don't just say "Vote." They say, Mr. Posen noted, "We're ready to be part of the conversation again."

SAN FRANCISCO — On Friday morning, just at the start of New York Fashion Week, more than 1,000 designers, models, factory workers, editors, retailers and influencers will march to Bryant Park to get out the vote. Most of them will be wearing the same thing: a white T-shirt (or T-shirt dress) with black letters that spell out the doodled slogan “Fashion for Our Future.” The designer: Zac Posen, for Old Navy.
In other words, what is essentially a giant Old Navy show is going to be one of the first big events of New York Fashion Week.
“Crazy, right?” Posen said a few weeks earlier. He was in his office at Gap Inc.’s headquarters in San Francisco, showing off a sample T-shirt. Crazy, he meant, that most of New York fashion would deign to don the same tee — and crazy that it would be one of his.
After all, in 2019, Posen, became the cautionary tale of the industry: the hot shot who lost his way, his name and his brand, in the wilds of ego and private equity. Since then, he had been cobbling together a freelance collaboration here, a private commission there, to make ends meet. He was, professionally, off the radar.
So were Old Navy and its parent company, Gap Inc., the onetime avatar of cool Americana that had turned khakis and a white T-shirt into a billion-dollar behemoth. Overexpansion and excessive discounting had sent it on a 20-year decline, left behind by fast-fashion giants Zara and H&M. A series of CEOs had promised turnarounds, only to see sales slow and the stock fall ever further. An ill-fated deal in 2020 with Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, left the company with egg on its face.
The group is still big — last year’s sales were $14.9 billion — but it had become “just product,” said Anna Wintour, the chief content officer of Condé Nast. “It had the name, it had the recognition, but there was no sense of excitement.”
Then, in August 2023, Richard Dickson, Mattel’s “Barbie” mastermind, was hired as CEO. He decided that one of the problems with Gap was fear of taking risks. So he took one.
In February, he hired Posen to be chief creative officer of Old Navy and executive vice president and creative director of Gap Inc. The two newly created positions make Posen his “creative partner” overseeing products, advertising and stores for all Gap brands — not just Old Navy but also Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta.
The stakes are high for Posen and the company. The only thing pop culture loves more than an odd-couple story is a resurrection story. This has the potential to be both. But there is also a fine line between being relevant and being elitist. Get it wrong, and it could be a disaster.
Posen is all in. He has traded his suits and tuxedos for jeans.
“When I met him, he was always wearing a suit,” said Harrison Ball, Posen’s fiance, a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet. “He existed on a red carpet. That’s what his company and his career demanded of him. I’m cleaning a 20-year-old storage unit right now. It’s like, tuxedo, tuxedo, tuxedo, tuxedo.”
During the early months of the pandemic, Ball said, Posen “started to wear jeans and took his shoes off and stopped styling his hair.”
The two got engaged two years ago, and they have gone through their career transitions together. Ball’s last season with the ballet coincided with Posen’s freelance period, and the designer came to every one of Ball’s performances, sitting in the first ring in the seat that used to be George Balanchine’s and making dinner for assorted dancers afterward.
“But I chose to leave,” Ball said. “Zac didn’t. He was forced to make that choice.” It was, he said, “devastating.”
Posen prefers to think of his current job as another stage in his hero’s journey, the one that took him from SoHo, where he was raised by an artist father and a lawyer mother; to St. Ann’s School in Brooklyn; to Central Saint Martins in London, holding his first fashion show at 21 and founding the House of Z, the name of the operating company that owned his brand.
His descent came after years of struggling to build the business. In 2019, his private equity backer, Ronald Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos., decided it was time for its exit and, after failing to find a buyer, wound down the House of Z, selling all of its intellectual property and archives. (Posen received nothing.) That was just before COVID lockdowns put fashion on pause for months — a dark period that prepared Posen to scale the heights, or at least the 15-story headquarters, of Gap Inc.
“Everything has led to this,” Posen said. “This” being his new office, and life, in San Francisco; “everything” being the multiple side gigs he took on to finance his own business that helped school him in accessibility. See his line with David’s Bridal, his stint designing the uniforms for Delta Air Lines, his work as the head of Brooks Brothers womenswear and his six years as a judge on “Project Runway.”
Even if, he said, Gap wasn’t on his radar “at all.” Even if he remembered thinking on his first day, “What am I doing here?”
Yet it was Posen’s experience with failure that Dickson said was part of what attracted him to the designer when they first met.
“I really appreciated that Zac had gone through very difficult periods of his career,” Dickson said. It’s the ability to handle both success and challenge that is critical, he said, “when you’re in a leadership role at this level and scale.”
At this moment, as fashion segues into entertainment, Posen may actually have stumbled into his ideal job.
He feels as if the needle is moving. When he began approaching designers for collaborations, the answers, he said, were almost always: “Let’s see. We’re not ready for that. We love Zac, but we’re not sure it’s right for us.” Now, he said, he has a slate of names lined up. The group’s second quarter results, released at the end of August, beat sales expectations. There may even be a full-fledged show next year. In the meantime, along with outfitting the fashion week march, Old Navy is also throwing a 30th-anniversary bash during the New York collections.
The point is, Posen said, those Old Navy T-shirts (which are going to be sold in stores) don’t just say “Vote.” They say, Posen noted, “We’re ready to be part of the conversation again.”

A Heavy Dependence On Garment Exports Hobbles Bangladesh: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Garment exports lifted the country to new heights. But overreliance on that industry also helped bring down Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Not long ago, Bangladesh was hailed as an economic miracle. Its singular focus on exporting textiles and apparel delivered rapid growth, lifting millions out of poverty and winning the country's prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, fame and admiration.
But Ms. Hasina's abrupt exit from power this week has exposed the limitations of that strategy, as Bangladesh struggles to combat steep inflation and joblessness that economists say are largely the result of poor policy decisions. Her increasingly authoritarian rule and Bangladesh's widespread corruption only added to the frustration that boiled over and forced her ouster.
Now, Bangladesh must decide its future.
Student protesters who had called for Ms. Hasina's resignation have brought in Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer, to oversee an interim government. Mr. Yunus faces a daunting task.
Most immediately, the country must restore order and stabilize its economy. In the longer term, Bangladesh will have to confront the wider economic stresses that had sent the protesters into the streets in the first place. All of that must happen on top of urgent demands to address the widespread abuses of Ms. Hasina's repressive tenure.
It is unclear how long the interim government will remain in place and how broad a mandate it will assume. But it and Mr. Yunus have the "aspirations of many entrusted upon them to deliver justice, create a functional economy and democracy, and establish rule of law and a transparent and accountable government," said Saad Hammadi, a fellow at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Canada.
These challenges might be too much for an interim government whose main purpose is to ensure that new leaders are elected through a free and fair process, Mr. Hammadi said in an email. "Institutional reforms will be required across the administration," he added.
Bangladesh underwent economic reforms starting in the 1970s, and the garment industry has been central to the country's economy for decades. But Ms. Hasina, who came to power in 2009, narrowed the country's focus to that single sector and expanded into new global markets, which drove much of Bangladesh's growth.
Cheaply made garments were attractive to global clothing retailers, especially fast-fashion brands like Zara and H&M. At the same time, that demand created livelihoods for millions of people, especially women, and transformed living standards.
Ms. Hasina spent heavily on infrastructure, reassuring international companies that they could rely on the country to meet their demands.
"What she brought was a level of stability, which was attractive for foreign investors," said Thomas Kean, a consultant on Bangladesh at the International Crisis Group. Garment buyers were unlikely to send business to Bangladesh if there were worker strikes, power cuts or other factors that made it unreliable, Mr. Kean said.
Ms. Hasina also instilled domestic confidence. Even as she brought the armed forces and judiciary under her control, quashed dissent and turned increasingly authoritarian, there was almost a "compact" between Bangladeshis and her government, Mr. Kean added. "There was a belief that she and the Awami League were the party that would deliver economic growth and development," he said, referring to the political party Ms. Hasina has led since 1981.
For more than a decade under Ms. Hasina, the economy grew at a blistering pace, in some years crossing 7 percent. Garment exports drove more than 80 percent of the country's earnings.
But that dependency was also Ms. Hasina's undoing.
The pandemic reduced global demand for textiles and apparel. At the same time, supply chain disruptions and Russia's war on Ukraine sharply raised prices for imported food and fuel. With so little diversification in its economy, Bangladesh was unable to pull in enough revenue from other industries to help pay the bills.
As inflation soared, the Hasina government's efforts to control it backfired. While trying to prop up the value of its weakening currency, Bangladesh spent down its foreign exchange reserves, which dropped so low that it was forced to seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2022.
By the time garment exports bounced back after the pandemic, Bangladesh was mired in its short-term troubles -- a situation that also highlighted underlying problems. Bangladesh collects very little in taxes, partly because of a lax bureaucracy and an unwillingness by many citizens to pay their taxes. Its tax-to-G.D.P. ratio, a measure of a government's ability to fund its priorities, is one of the lowest in the world. That meant it could not count on tax revenue to pay its steep bills.
Bangladesh still has a high growth rate, but economists and others say that the growth has been uneven, and that income inequality is high. The sense that the growth story on paper did not match up with the reality people saw on the ground fed into distrust of the government, said Iftekhar Zaman, the executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh.
Brazen corruption, including loan fraud and reports of money laundering by many in the business community who were seen as close to the prime minister, sowed further disaffection, Mr. Zaman said. "Everybody knew that this was being sustained by the people who were supposed to control corruption," he said.
Perhaps the biggest long-term problem for Ms. Hasina was her government's inability to create new jobs because of its narrow focus on the garment business. There aren't enough new or better-paying jobs for the country's large working-age population.
Last month, that cumulative frustration found an outlet when students began demanding an end to a preferential quota system for government jobs, which provide stability that Bangladesh's private sector often does not. Once Ms. Hasina sent the armed forces to quell the protests, the bubbling frustration with a system that had failed to deliver boiled into rage against her.
On Thursday, Bangladesh swore in the new interim government, with Mr. Yunus, 84, as its leader. He called for calm and appealed to the nation to restore order and eschew violence. Although it's unclear how long he will remain in office, Mr. Yunus -- a social entrepreneur who married profit with development through the microlending operation he pioneered through Grameen Bank -- is expected to institute market-friendly reforms.

Messy Love Is OK at 26, She Sings: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The rising country star writes about disastrous love and learning big lessons with charm, wit and solid hooks. Her new LP, "Am I Okay?," is due Friday.
The budding country star Megan Moroney was 36 stories above Times Square last month, waiting to meet some of her biggest fans, who were among the first invited to hear "Am I Okay?," her eagerly anticipated second album.
As she prepared to greet her guests in the glass aviary atop the Hard Rock Hotel, Moroney admitted she'd culled them via social media, group chats and meet and greets. "They don't know I stalk them," she said after slipping into a cobalt mini dress from Zara and a pair of metallic Balmain stiletto boots. Her hair teased into a butter-blond cloud, she joked, "It's 20 pounds of hair and 10 pounds of makeup." It's a look her fans recreate to varying degrees, but they're also drawn to the way Moroney embraces the moments most people airbrush out of their Instagram-perfect lives.
One example is the closer of "Am I Okay?," which is due on Friday: the spare, simple "Hell of a Show." It's just a verse and a chorus, a raw artist singing over an acoustic guitar about being jerked around by a self-absorbed boyfriend, pulling it together to slay a crowd of people who "love me better than you could've," but still crying herself to sleep.
It's hard to believe there's anyone who isn't clamoring for the attention of this 26-year-old rising songwriter. Moroney was the leading female nominee at the Academy of Country Music Awards this spring, competing for top prizes alongside Kacey Musgraves and Lainey Wilson. Her rocket-ship trajectory began with "Tennessee Orange" in 2022, a Romeo and Juliet ballad for fans of SEC football, which earned her 18 record company offers and nominations for both the A.C.M.s' and the Country Music Association Awards' song of the year. (She ultimately signed with Sony's Nashville and Columbia's New York divisions.)
Two years ago, when Moroney released her first EP, she seemed like just another attractive Nashville hopeful in a city overstocked with them. At least on paper. But she had ideas about how to become a star, and they started with her songwriting. Wry, vulnerable and a real reflection of how 20-somethings drink and wreck their hearts, Moroney's songs are authentic in a way the Music Row system can rarely access.
Juli Griffith, a three-decade publishing veteran who is now Moroney's manager, recalled listening to her for the first time and thinking, "My God! That broken voice. You just believed her, and it struck you and stuck with you."
Moroney, who grew up in Douglasville, Ga., didn't drink in high school and dated her brother's best friend for two years -- until he dumped her when he went to college. That first heartbreak shattered her, but also provided resilience when she realized she could survive.
She attended the University of Georgia and majored in accounting, getting a music business certificate in the process. Her parents wouldn't allow her to drop out to pursue songwriting, so Moroney, who graduated with a 3.9, pledged Kappa Delta and doubled down on college life. She started writing songs, but not telling people. After the bro-country star Chase Rice saw her playing a set of covers before the singer Jon Langston performed at a sorority charity event, he asked her to open for him at Athens's Georgia Theater, with one condition: She had to write an original song.
"In those four years, I grew up so much as a person, learned so much about who I am," she said. "Everything you go through in college, between the heartbreaks and being so drunk that you're literally fighting for your life on a curb, head between your legs -- that builds character."
Some emerging female artists would hesitate to be that candid. But Moroney's brand of truth-telling, equally funny and wounded, has struck a chord. "If you get a little too drunk and call your ex, like, whatever," she said. "I think that's all normal and human."
As she prepped for the Hard Rock event, Moroney discussed the artists who have provided her with inspiration. She was raised on a diet of John Prine, Eagles, Emmylou Harris and J.D. Souther by her father, and said her glammed-up look was partly a representation of a distinctly feminine power.
"I've always loved the way Dolly and Kacey have their hair up to the ceiling, you know?," she said, referring to Parton and Musgraves. "It's like they can say whatever they want, dressed like that."
"Am I Okay?," the follow-up to "Lucky" from last year, charts phases of several failed relationships, including one with a "Mr. Right" that was over before recording began; he inspired the title track's euphoric vertigo of seemingly finding the one. "That started out really great, then was like, 'Wait! This is actually pretty horrible,"' she said, laughing about the whiplash.
The new songs run an emotional gauntlet. There's the too-good-to-be-true steel guitar celebration "Third Time's the Charm"; a darker, minimalist track called "I Know You" that skewers a cheating soon-to-be-ex with layers of harmony that echo like voices in one's head; and "Indifferent," which grows from acoustic to bombastic as Moroney bids a relationship goodbye with a dismissive wave.
"It's like I'm 26, dating people, and you're going to be wrong," she said. "OK, fine. That's the point: It happened, and I'm OK. It's happening to someone right now, thinking this is the one. They're not, and it's going to be OK."
Kristian Bush, Moroney's producer (and half of the Grammy-winning country act Sugarland), joined her in New York for the event. Moroney, who had been a publishing intern at his publishing company in Marietta, Ga., called Bush shortly after she moved to Nashville, and he swung into action. "When Megan told me what she was doing, I got very protective and called Juli, my longtime publisher," he said. "Meg was a pretty girl, and I know how those rooms can be; Juli was the only one I trusted."
Once convinced of Moroney's work ethic, Griffith signed on as her manager and set up recording sessions with people who "would let Meg lead," which included Jessi Alexander, Luke Laird and Jessie Jo Dillon, the daughter of the Country Music Hall of Fame inductee Dean Dillon, who all have multiple writing credits on "Okay?" In the recording studio, Moroney prefers older-school processes to assemble a sound she calls "a vintage car that flies": actual musicians playing together instead of relying on drum machines, computer tracks and overdubbed instruments. (She has branded her sound "emo cowgirl country.")
"I know in my songs there's a lot of I'm bringing men down," Moroney said, adding that she'd only been in love three times. "But I always make jokes to the audience, 'Clearly, I love men, because I keep coming back and I keep trying. It just keeps not working out."'
Her honesty and wit have turned even casual listeners into loyal fans. At the Hard Rock, around 40 arrived from as far away as Arizona, California, Florida and even Canada. Some wore T-shirts with Moroney's picture and the words "Feminine Rage." After gathering in a room filled with cobalt and silver heart-shaped balloons, Moroney played all 14 songs and offered (at times laughing) commentary. The already released singles had everyone singing along with gusto, and "Heaven by Noon," a ballad inspired by an uneventful last conversation between her aunt and uncle on Sept. 11, hours before his death in the attack on the World Trade Center, brought even the men in the room to tears. (They cried at some of the relationship songs, too.)
Moroney will be bringing the music to many more people at headlining shows this summer, along with her ongoing opening slot on Kenny Chesney's stadium and amphitheater tour, and she'll be paying attention to the details. If her dating life has been a minefield, she believes using the shrapnel for her career is intentional: "Things don't happen to me, they happen for me," she said. And there have been important lessons in the highs and lows of her personal and professional lives so far.
"To me, the strong people can look at the sad situation, and be like, 'That was really messed up. You hurt my feelings.' Maybe I'll have a song and be vulnerable by saying that," she said. "But, also, I'll follow it up with a song that's like 'I'm going to be just fine. Don't worry about it."'

Uber to Offer $ 1,000
For Car Owners to Switch
Uber will pay $ 1,000 in credits to some commuters in the United States and Canada who ditch their cars for five weeks in favor of public and other transport services, it said on Thursday.
The ride-hailing and food delivery platform operator has, for several years, pushed the adoption of environment-friendly electric vehicles and has pledged $ 800 million to support its driver partners' shift entirely to E.V.s by 2040.
Under the "One Less Car" initiative, Uber will select up to 175 car owners in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Miami, San Francisco, Toronto and Vancouver for a five-week program.
They will get $ 500 in credit on the Uber app, a $ 200 voucher for car rental or car-share services and $ 300 for use on alternate modes such as public transport.
A similar initiative by Uber in Australia last year showed that commuters mainly took to walking, cycling and ride-sharing after ditching their cars. REUTERS

H&M Aims for Growth
With Renewed Discounts
H&M plans to offer more discounted fashions in the second half of this year as it tries to win back customers from the likes of Zara owner Inditex and Shein.
H&M has recently prioritized profitability over sales volumes to reach a 10 percent operating margin goal by this year.
But this has come at a cost in terms of market share, and in March the Swedish retailer said it would bolster sales to keep up with the competition.
On Thursday, H&M said external factors like material costs and currency moves were making the 10 percent margin goal more difficult to reach this year, and that it needed to ramp up sales growth.
Chief Executive Daniel Erver told Reuters it was vital for sales to pick up in the remaining two quarters of the year.
"If we see a weak sales development in the third quarter it will be very difficult to achieve," he said in an interview. REUTERS

McCormick Comes In Hot,
Helped by Price Increases
McCormick beat market expectations for second-quarter profit and sales on Thursday, led by strong demand for its spices and seasonings in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Customers grappling with still-high costs preferred cooking at home to dining out, improving volumes across the company's consumer segment, its biggest unit.
Consumer sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 5 percent even as total sales in the segment decreased 0.8 percent.
McCormick, the maker of Cholula hot sauce, reported a 1 percent fall in net sales, to $ 1.64 billion; the company cited the divestiture of its canning business as a reason for the drop.
McCormick reported an adjusted profit of 69 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 59 cents.
Benefits from price increases lifted the company's gross profit margin to 37.7 percent from 37.1 percent a year earlier. REUTERS

After Accident, Princess Anne of Britain Is Hospitalized With a Concussion: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The younger sister of King Charles III sustained a concussion after an incident on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said.
Princess Anne, the younger sister of King Charles III, was hospitalized on Sunday evening after suffering a concussion and other minor injuries in an unspecified accident, Buckingham Palace said on Monday.
The palace said Anne, 73, remained in Southmead Hospital in Bristol, but was expected to "make a full and swift recovery." A spokesman said the princess "is recovering well, is in a comfortable condition and is being kept in hospital as a precautionary measure for further observation."
The palace offered no details on the nature of the accident, which occurred while Anne was walking on the grounds of Gatcombe Park, a sprawling estate in Gloucestershire that serves as her country residence.
A person familiar with the royal family said there were horses in the area where Anne was injured, and that her head wounds were consistent with having had contact with the legs or head of a horse. Anne is an accomplished equestrian who competed for Britain in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal.
The palace said Anne's injuries would force her to postpone a trip to Canada later in the week. She will also miss a state banquet for Emperor Naruhito of Japan, and his wife, Empress Masako, a palace official said, that is being hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla on Tuesday evening.
Charles has been kept closely informed, the palace added, saying that he joined the whole royal family in "sending his fondest love and well wishes to the princess for a speedy recovery."
Anne's accident is the latest setback for Britain's royal family, which has struggled with the illnesses of two of its most visible members, Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, both of whom have been diagnosed with cancer.
Catherine, the wife of Prince William, made her first public appearance in several months on June 15 at a military parade commemorating the birthday of the king. Before her appearance, she said in a statement, "As anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days."
The king's decision to go ahead with the state visit of the Japanese emperor has been viewed as a positive sign for his recovery. There have been news reports, not confirmed by Buckingham Palace, that Charles was also planning to go ahead with a visit in October to Australia and Samoa, which will host a meeting of the Commonwealth heads of government.
The sidelining of Anne will deprive the royal family of one of its most indomitable workers. She routinely logs more than 400 public events a year -- often the most of any family member -- and with the thinning of the ranks of senior royals in recent years, Anne has shouldered an even heavier load.
With the deaths of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, the illnesses of Charles and Catherine, and the departure of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, for the United States, the royal family has had a much smaller pool of members to pick up its busy calendar of royal duties and obligations.
After the queen's death in September 2022, Anne, her only daughter, assumed unofficial status as the senior female figure in the House of Windsor, though in royal protocol she is outranked by Camilla. Princess Charlotte, the 9-year-old daughter of Catherine and William, is the most senior female royal in terms of succession.
Like her brother Charles, Anne has weathered ups and downs in her personal life, as well as in her public image. As a young woman, she was sometimes viewed as haughty and sharp-tongued. But she became respected for her philanthropic work, serving as president of Save the Children from 1970 to 2017.
Anne's first marriage to a fellow equestrian, Mark Phillips, ended in divorce, but she has had a stable second marriage to Timothy Laurence, a retired Royal Navy officer who served as an aide to the queen. An official said Mr. Laurence accompanied Anne to the hospital. He and her two children, Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips, were on the estate at the time of her accident, the official said.
In her public appearances, Anne is known for her brisk and unflappable demeanor -- a characteristic she has displayed in other challenging episodes. In 1974, she survived a kidnapping attempt, telling the gunman who ordered her out of her car to hold her for ransom: "Not bloody likely!"

U.K. Rate Of Inflation Hits 2.3%, Near Target: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Nelson, Eshe

Publication info: Nelson, Eshe.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The decline, which was less than economists expected, is nearing the Bank of England's 2 percent target.
Britain's inflation rate slowed last month to its lowest level in about three years, further cementing the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates later this year.
Consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in April from a year earlier, down from 3.2 percent in March, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. The rate, which declined slightly less than economists expected, was the lowest since July 2021 and approached the Bank of England's 2 percent target.
Inflation was pulled down by a decrease in the cap on household energy bills set by a government regulator. Food inflation also slowed to 2.9 percent, from 4 percent.
The steep decline in the headline inflation rate, which includes food and energy, signals a new phase in British policymakers' battle against inflation. Having aggressively raised interest rates after prices soared following pandemic lockdowns and the turmoil in energy markets after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, central bankers are trying to determine how much inflationary pressure is left in the economy and how soon they can cut interest rates.
It's a challenge shared by other major central banks. In the eurozone, officials have signaled rates cuts could come as soon as this summer, whereas in the United States, inflation remains relatively hot at 3.4 percent.
In Britain, the central bank expected inflation to fall to 2.1 percent last month. It forecast that, after a few months around its target, inflation would bounce a little higher and fluctuate around 2.5 percent until late 2025 as energy prices, which have stabilized, no longer pull down the overall inflation rate. But policymakers are scrutinizing wage growth and price increases in the services sector, such as restaurants, hotels and concerts, which are traditionally stubborn components of inflation and remain uncomfortably strong, hovering around 6 percent annual growth.
The slightly stronger-than-expected inflation reading could delay a rate cut by a few months over the summer, analysts said.
"While today's meaningful decline is welcome news, the Bank of England will be disappointed," Zara Nokes, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a note.
Policymakers will have concerns about the stickiness of some aspects of inflation, particularly because prices for services continued to grow more than expected in April, she added.
Policymakers have indicated that as long as inflation broadly follows their latest projections, rate cuts are on their way. Two members of the rate-setting committee have already voted for cuts.
A rate cut at the Bank of England's next policy meeting in June would be premature, Ms. Nokes said. The following meeting is in August, and traders are betting more heavily on a rate cut then.
The April inflation data comes on the heels of another report for Britain's economy that highlighted recent improvements. On Tuesday, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the institution was "delivering a little bit of good news for the U.K." as it ended its annual review of the country's economy.
After an unexpectedly strong exit from a recession at the start of this year, the fund raised ts forecast for Britain's economic growth this year to 0.7 percent, from 0.5 percent a month ago. For 2025, it forecast 1.5 percent growth, with interest rates falling and wages growing faster than inflation.
Actions taken by the British government and the Bank of England, "combined with favorable energy price developments, are paying off," Ms. Georgieva said in London. "The economy is growing, inflation is falling and soft landing is in sight," she said, referring to a situation in which inflation slows without a painful recession.
The fund expected inflation in Britain to make a "durable return" to target by early 2025 and recommended cutting interest rates from 5.25 percent to 4.75 percent or 4.5 percent this year, and by another one percentage point next year.
But the longer-term prospects for Britain's economy were gloomier. Weak labor productivity and the number of people who are out of the job market because of long-term health problems are weighing on the outlook, the fund said.
The fund also warned that British officials will probably need to make difficult choices to stabilize public debt, and balance that against the demands on increased public spending and investment. It advised against more tax cuts "as a general principle" even as the governing Conservative Party has stated its ambition to further reduce taxes ahead of a general election within the next eight months.

Christopher Edley Jr., 71, Whose Civil Rights Insight Influenced Presidents, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He pivoted between serving as an adviser to the Carter, Clinton and Obama White Houses and teaching at Harvard and Berkeley, where he was the law school dean.
Christopher Edley Jr., a civil rights expert and policy adviser who worked closely with three Democratic presidents and six presidential campaigns and served as an innovative dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, died on Friday in Stanford, Calif. He was 71.
His wife, Maria Echaveste, a deputy chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, said the cause of death, in a hospital, was complications of surgery.
Though he spent most of his career in teaching, including 23 years at Harvard Law School, his alma mater, Mr. Edley's career spanned the academic-political divide.
In the late 1970s, he worked for the White House domestic policy staff, specializing on issues like food stamps, child welfare and disability for President Jimmy Carter. Over a decade later, he took a leave from Harvard to be an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton.
Both roles came after working as a top Democratic campaign adviser, a role he also performed for Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, Howard Dean and Barack Obama.
In all cases he was known as a stalwart advocate for liberal policies on race, especially affirmative action, a position that often put him at odds with Democratic centrists eager to moderate the party's civil rights stance.
When, in 1995, Mr. Clinton named Mr. Edley to oversee a review of affirmative action under the slogan "mend it, don't end it," Mr. Edley made sure that very little mending was necessary. And he resisted pressure from inside the White House to engage with critics of affirmative action and other civil rights issues, whom he dismissed as dangerously disingenuous.
In 1991, he joined three other Black professors from top-tier law schools in testifying against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, arguing that Justice Thomas -- then a federal appeals court judge -- was too much of a political partisan to make fair decisions, a charge that he lobbed at many other Black conservatives.
"Though their opposition to these measures is framed as principle," he said of critics of affirmative action, writing in The Atlantic in 1997, "certainly their real goal is to protect the current distribution of privilege and opportunity that has produced white-male elites in virtually every sector."
By then he had returned to Harvard. Alarmed at a looming court case that seemed to threaten affirmative action in college admissions, Mr. Edley and a colleague, Gary Orfield, convened an emergency group of college presidents to discuss their plans should the courts dismantle racial preferences in education.
They found there were no plans, and in fact very little information about the state of civil rights and race-related policy in general. In response, Mr. Edley and Mr. Orfield founded the Civil Rights Project, which over the years has generated dozens of influential books, papers and conferences and become a model for creating research programs within law schools.
Mr. Edley did something similar after becoming dean of the Berkeley law school in 2004. He initiated a series of policy-oriented centers within the school focusing on issues like the environment and technology. He also greatly expanded the school's classroom space and library and created grants and fellowships to support students interested in public-interest careers.
"He was really a transformative dean," said Erwin Chemerinsky, the current dean and a classmate of Mr. Edley's at Harvard Law.
Mr. Edley stepped down as dean of Berkeley law in 2013 to deal with treatment for prostate cancer. He returned to teaching in 2016, and in 2021 was interim dean of the university's school of education.
Christopher Fairfield Edley Jr., was born on Jan. 13, 1953, in Boston, where his father, Chris Edley Sr., was completing legal studies at Harvard. His mother, Zaida (Coles) Edley, was an actress and speech therapist.
Christopher grew up in Philadelphia and New Rochelle, N.Y., following his father's career as a prosecutor, program officer at the Ford Foundation and president of the United Negro College Fund.
He graduated with a degree in mathematics and economics from Swarthmore College in 1973, then enrolled at Harvard Law School, where he became the first second-generation Black student in the institution's history. He took a leave of absence in 1976 to work for Mr. Carter's presidential campaign, then joined the Carter White House after graduating in 1978, receiving both a law degree and a master's in public policy.
After Mr. Carter lost re-election, Mr. Edley joined the faculty at Harvard Law, where he developed a specialty in education, civil rights and administrative law. Among his students was Mr. Obama.
Mr. Edley's first two marriages ended in divorce. He met Ms. Echaveste while both were involved with the Clinton White House; they married in 1999. Along with her, he is survived by his son from his second marriage, Christopher Edley III; two children with Ms. Echaveste, Elias and Zara; a grandson; and his sister, Judith Edley.
While remaining at Berkeley as dean, Mr. Edley worked closely as an adviser to the Obama campaign, then joined the inner ranks of the transition team. But he resisted entreaties to join yet another White House team, preferring to remain focused on civil rights issues in California.
"This was ground zero for the opportunity struggle that defines the civil rights agenda," he told The New York Times in 2007. "The challenges in education, health care, immigration, the criminal justice system, here in California, capture what the battle for racial and ethnic justice is today."

Clothier Express Has Filed For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Express Inc. -- once a trendsetter of casual office attire that has struggled to compete with the likes of Zara and H&M -- has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The retailer based in Columbus, Ohio, and founded in 1980 also said Monday it is seeking to sell the majority of its stores.
Express, which is the parent of the Bonbons and UpWest brands, is shuttering a handful of its outlets in the process. The company said it plans to close 95 of its Express retail stores and all 10 of its UpWest stores.
Closing sales at locations being shut down, which span across more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., are set to begin Tuesday. Beyond these closures, Express said that it expects to conduct business as usual.
Also on Monday, Express announced that it received a nonbinding letter of intent from a group led by WHP Global to potentially purchase the majority of its stores. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Grocery Giants to Sell Stores in Pursuit of Merger
Supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons said Monday they will sell more of their stores in an effort to quell the federal government's concerns about their proposed merger.
The companies now plan to sell 579 Kroger and Albertsons stores in markets where they overlap to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a New Hampshire grocery supplier and operator, for $ 2.9 billion. Under the initial divestiture plan, announced in September, C&S had planned to purchase 413 stores for $ 1.9 billion.
It's unclear whether the new plan will satisfy regulators. In February, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the $ 24.6 billion merger between the grocery giants, saying the lack of competition would lead to higher grocery prices and lower wages for workers.
The F.T.C. also said the initial plan to divest 413 stores to CS was "inadequate."

Delta to Raise Wages Amid Union Rumblings
Delta Air Lines, the most profitable U.S. carrier, is raising pay for nonunion employees as it gets ready for another attempt by a union to represent its flights attendants.
Its C.E.O., Ed Bastian, told Delta employees Monday that the airline will boost pay for flight attendants and ground workers by 5 percent, raise the minimum wage for its U.S. workers to $ 19 per hour and set aside money for merit raises.
Delta said the increases affect more than 80,000 employees.
"With this increase in base pay and starting rates, we continue our commitment to provide Delta people with industry-leading total compensation for industry-leading performance," Mr. Bastian wrote in a memo to staff. He said the company has raised pay among major work groups by a cumulative 20 percent to 25 percent since 2022. That figure includes base pay and profit-sharing. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Former employees of the brand, a Gen Z fashion favorite, recount race and size discrimination in a new documentary on HBO.
The clothing store Brandy Melville is known for selling diminutive, single-size pieces popular among Gen Z: linen short shorts, heart-print camisoles and sweatshirts printed with the word "Malibu."
Behind its Cali-girl aesthetic is a business that mistreats teenage employees and cashes in on young women's insecurities, according to "Brandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion," a documentary released on Tuesday on HBO.
The documentary intersperses former employees' accounts of racism and size discrimination while working in its stores with a broader look at the labor and environmental costs of the fast-fashion industry. The filmmakers said Stephan Marsan, the company's mysterious chief executive, did not respond to several requests for comment.
Eva Orner, the documentary's director, said in an interview last week that it was a challenge to get former employees on camera because so many were fearful of the company. Those who were included were identified by only their first names. "I've done a lot of stuff in war zones, and with refugees and really life-or-death situations, and people have been more comfortable being on camera," she said.
Ms. Orner, an Australian who won an Academy Award for the documentary "Taxi to the Dark Side," had not heard of Brandy Melville before producers mentioned the company to her in 2022 as a potential subject of investigation. The more she learned, the more she was disturbed by the brand's cultlike following among teenage girls, who see it flaunted by celebrities like Kaia Gerber and Kendall Jenner.
"These are the values that are in this T-shirt: It is racism, it is antisemitism, it is exploitation," Ms. Orner said. "I'm hoping parents watch this and are horrified."
Here are five of the major claims made in the documentary.
The company's business model is murky.
In some respects, Brandy Melville is similar to Zara, H&M and other retailers operating in the fast-fashion industry, which puts a premium on low-cost clothing manufactured on quick trend cycles. But its corporate structure is unusually "chaotic, messy and unclear," Ms. Orner said.
Each Brandy Melville store is owned by a different shell company, while the trademark for Brandy Melville is owned by a Swiss company, Kate Taylor, the author of a 2021 Business Insider investigation into the company that informed much of the documentary, said in the film. And despite leading a brand that built its success in large part on Instagram, Mr. Marsan has next to no online presence.
Former Brandy Melville staff members said in the documentary that executives would sometimes ask to buy the clothes the employees were wearing so that the brand could replicate them. The company has been accused online of stealing designs from independent designers and was sued by Forever 21 for copyright infringement in 2016. (The case ended in a confidential settlement, according to court documents.)
It has stood by its 'one size fits most' policy.
The company offers the bulk of its clothing in just one very small size, which it describes as "one size fits most." Mr. Marsan saw the policy as a way to keep the brand exclusive, according to former executives interviewed in the documentary, and criticism of the policy as confirmation that the strategy was working.
The film includes social media posts from customers saying they lost weight to fit into the brand's clothing. Multiple former employees described struggling with eating disorders while working at Brandy Melville, and several said the pressure to be thin while working there affected their self-esteem.
One former employee said in the documentary that working in the store made her hate her body and feel generally insecure.
Former employees described discriminatory hiring practices.
The company went out of its way to hire thin, white women who were often recruited on the spot while shopping in its stores, employees said in the documentary. Some said they were required to take daily full-body photos that were sent to Mr. Marsan, who sometimes fired them if he did not like the way they looked.
White employees were more likely to be assigned to the sales floor, while people of color were placed in less visible roles in the stock room, according to three former employees.
Former executives of Brandy Melville filed two lawsuits containing "serious allegations of racism" that were denied by the company in preliminary court filings, said Ms. Taylor, the reporter. One of the executives said in the documentary that his store in Toronto was closed by Mr. Marsan because it was frequented by people of color.
Company executives exchanged racist and antisemitic messages in a group chat.
Senior leadership shared Hitler memes, pornographic images and racist jokes in a group chat called "Brandy Melville gags," according to Ms. Taylor and two former executives interviewed in the documentary. One screenshot shown in the film features a skeletal woman wearing a sash that reads "Miss Auschwitz, 1943."
Mr. Marsan, his brother, store owners and members of the company's production team in Italy were all in the chat, according to one former store owner.
The group chat featured heavily in Ms. Taylor's Business Insider article. "The evil genius of Brandy is that when this exposé came out, they didn't do anything" except for briefly disable comments on their Instagram page, Ms. Orner said. "They just went on, business as usual."
The company may reflect broader patterns of exploitation in fast fashion.
Ms. Orner argued that Brandy Melville was also a case study in the way fast fashion can exploit workers and contribute to environmental waste.
The company's supply chain is opaque, but much of its clothing is manufactured at a factory in Prato, Italy, that employs Chinese immigrants, Ms. Orner said. Prato is home to several factories for fast-fashion companies, some of which have exploitative labor practices, Matteo Biffoni, the city's mayor, said in the documentary. (He did not comment on whether this was true of Brandy Melville's factory.)
The filmmakers also traveled to Ghana, where unwanted clothing items from the United States and Europe pile up in heaps and clog waterways. Brandy Melville's business model involves churning out inexpensive, trendy items that are likely to be discarded in this way, Ms. Orner said, and shipping them out to influencers in bulk, in exchange for free promotion.
"You can't make a film about fashion without showing the exploitation of pretty much everyone, from the workers, through to the models, through to the retailers to the consumers," Ms. Orner said. "Everyone's being exploited."

Kimberly-Clark PlansLeaner Operations
Kimberly-Clark said on Wednesday that it would reorganize into three business units as it looks to simplify operations and cut costs.
The consumer goods company, whose products include Kleenex, said it would incur about $ 1.5 billion in related costs over three years. Cash costs are expected to be about half that amount, mostly related to work force reductions, it said in a filing without disclosing how many jobs it would cut.
The company, based in Texas, is seeing benefits from its consistent price increases wane and inflation-stricken customers pull back on buying its pricier products. Kimberly-Clark, like it competitors, is losing shelf-space at retailers to more affordable private-label alternatives.
The company's reorganized segments will now include its business in North America, the international personal care segment and the international family care and professional businesses.

H&M's Quarterly ProfitIs Higher Than Expected
H&M, the world's second-largest listed fashion retailer, reported a first-quarter operating profit on Wednesday that was stronger than expected, as its new chief executive, Daniel Erver, said shoppers liked the brand's spring collections.
The Swedish group has struggled to maintain its position in the fast-fashion sector as a bigger rival, Zara, extended its dominance and the China-founded online retailer Shein, which sells $ 8 dresses, grew rapidly.
Mr. Erver said the company must concentrate on its core clientele. "Where we want to be laser-focused on being a credible fashion brand is for the younger female customer," he said.
H&M posted a quarterly operating profit of 2.08 billion crowns, or $ 196 million, up from 725 million crowns a year ago, and above the 1.43 billion expected by analysts in an LSEG poll.

China Wins Steel DisputeWith Australia
China has won a nearly three-year-long dispute with Australia at the World Trade Organization over tariffs on steel products that began during a low point of bilateral relations between the countries, and Australia's trade minister said Wednesday his government accepted the ruling.
Beijing took its complaint to the WTO in June 2021 over Australia's extra duties on railway wheels, wind towers and stainless steel sinks imported from China. Trade in these products was worth 62 million Australian dollars ( $ 40.4 million) in 2022.
On Tuesday, the WTO panel adjudicating the case in Geneva found that Australia's investigating authority, the Anti-Dumping Commission, had acted inconsistently with some articles of the anti-dumping agreement.
Australia's Trade Minister Don Farrell said Canberra accepted the WTO's ruling and supported a rules-based trading system.

Britain Issues a Definition of Extremism, Raising Concerns on Freedom of Speech: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The government said it would use a new legal definition of extremism to blacklist certain groups from public funding or engagement.
Britain's government published a new definition of extremism on Thursday that it intends to use to cut ties or funding to groups deemed to have crossed the line, but which critics fear could curtail campaigners' rights and curb free speech.
Michael Gove, a senior cabinet minister, said in a statement that the move was intended to "protect democratic values" by being "clear and precise in identifying the dangers posed by extremism."
Some advocacy groups and legal experts greeted the announcement with concern, warning that it could affect the rights of those deemed by the government to meet the definition. The only way to challenge such a decision is likely to be through the courts.
The initiative has also stirred a wider debate about how, before a general election that must be held by early next year, British politicians choose to deal with domestic tensions that have risen since Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel's subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of thousands of people have attended pro-Palestinian demonstrations in London and, according to the government, there has been a significant rise in both antisemitic incidents and anti-Muslim hate cases.
Even before the details of the new extremism proposals were made public, they had provoked criticism from rights groups and concern from three former Conservative Party home secretaries, whose remit included national security, who warned against using the issue of extremism for political advantage.
Leaders from the Church of England also weighed in. The archbishop of Canterbury -- Justin Welby, who is the head of the church and a peer in the House of Lords -- and the archbishop of York said in a statement on Tuesday that the new definition "not only inadvertently threatens freedom of speech, but also the right to worship and peaceful protest, things that have been hard won and form the fabric of a civilized society."
They added, "Crucially, it risks disproportionately targeting Muslim communities, who are already experiencing rising levels of hate and abuse."
Under the new plan, extremism will be defined as "the promotion or advancement of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance" that aims to "negate or destroy the fundamental rights and freedoms of others; or undermine, overturn or replace the U.K.'s system of liberal parliamentary democracy and democratic rights," or intentionally create a "permissive environment" for others to do so.
In its statement, the government said that its new definition was not statutory and would have no effect on existing criminal law. But it added that "the government will undertake a robust process to assess groups for extremism against the definition, which will then inform decisions around government engagement and funding."
Critics said it was that element -- the idea that whichever government is in power could blacklist groups it considers extremist and bar them from meeting with any government bodies or officials or receiving taxpayer funding -- that could threaten free speech and civil liberties.
David Anderson, a senior lawyer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the government, told the BBC that there were many questions that still needed to be answered about the policy.
"The definition remains extremely broad," he said. "For example, it catches people who advance an ideology which negates the fundamental rights of others. One can imagine both sides of the trans debate leaping on that one."
Mr. Anderson, who is also a member of the House of Lords, said he did not take much comfort from reassurances that the definition related only to interactions with government. "I think you are also affecting a lot of people potentially by branding them as extremists," he said, adding that it "affects potentially the freedoms and reputations of an awful lot of people."
Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Gove identified some of the organizations whose activities will be assessed in line with the new definition, including the British National Socialist Movement, which has been described by the government as a white supremacist group and Patriotic Alternative which opposes multiculturalism and immigration.
Mr. Gove said that those that "promote neo-Nazi ideology, argue for forced repatriation, a white ethno-state and the targeting of minority groups for intimidation, are precisely the type of groups about which we should be concerned."
He also named the Muslim Association of Britain, which says it is dedicated to "nurturing, supporting and leading Muslim grassroots contributions" toward positive social change; Cage, which has urged the release of prisoners in Guantánamo Bay and campaigned against some antiterrorism laws; and MEND, which describes its aims as helping to empower and encourage British Muslims. Such groups, Mr. Gove added, "give rise to concern because of their Islamist orientation and views."
The Muslim Council of Britain condemned the approach as undemocratic and potentially illegal. "A broad cross section of British society will see through the government's divisive extremism proposals," said Zara Mohammed, its secretary general.
Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International's chief executive, described the plan as a "dangerously sweeping approach to labeling groups and individuals 'extremist."'
"This attempt to stigmatize legitimate, peaceful political activity is taking us further down the road toward authoritarianism," he added.
Some Conservative lawmakers also warned against any measures that could threaten free speech. Miriam Cates, a Conservative Party lawmaker, told The Times of London that she believed radical Islamism to be the most significant threat to Britain's national security but that it should be addressed "by properly upholding our existing laws and proscribing groups that have links to terrorism."
"In a pluralistic democracy, there are, of course, a wide range of opinions that many of us would consider extreme," she added. "But the state should only intervene if there is an actual threat of physical harm. Otherwise, we erode our fundamental freedoms of speech, association, expression and religion."
The government tried to address such concerns in its statement on Thursday, saying that the plan was "not about silencing those with private and peaceful beliefs -- not will it affect free speech, which will always be protected."
A list of groups deemed to have fallen foul of the new definition is expected to be released in the coming weeks after an assessment process during which they will be allowed to make representations, Downing Street said.
The initiative follows a speech by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak this month in which he spoke of "a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality" in Britain since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in Israel. Mr. Sunak appealed to people in Britain to come together "to combat the forces of division and beat this poison."
Mr. Sunak had previously given an outspoken warning at a meeting of senior police officers that "mob rule is replacing democratic rule."
In an awkward juxtaposition for Mr. Sunak, the announcement on extremism came in the same week that it emerged that the Conservative Party's largest donor had reportedly said that Diane Abbott, a prominent Black lawmaker, "should be shot."
Asked on Thursday whether such comments would run afoul of the new extremism definition, Mr. Gove said, "I wouldn't want to conflate those motivated by an extremist ideology with an individual comment, however horrific, which had quite rightly been called out and which has quite rightly led to an apology."

Tories Under Fire After Donor Is Accused of Racist Remarks: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Frank Hester, the leading supporter of Britain's Conservative Party, is accused of making the comments about Diane Abbott, a well-known lawmaker.
Britain's governing Conservative Party was under pressure Tuesday to return more than 10 million pounds to a donor who reportedly said that Diane Abbott, a prominent lawmaker, "should be shot," and that looking at her made him "want to hate all Black women."
According to an investigation by The Guardian newspaper, Frank Hester, a health care technology entrepreneur, made the comments in 2019, at a meeting held at the offices of his company, The Phoenix Partnership. He has apologized but has not confirmed the Guardian's account of what he said.
Mr. Hester said on Monday that he "accepts that he was rude about Diane Abbot in a private meeting several years ago but his criticism had nothing to do with her gender nor color of skin," in a statement released by his firm that misspelled her last name.
The statement added that he had called Ms. Abbott twice "to try to apologize directly for the hurt he has caused her, and is deeply sorry for his remarks," and that he wished "to make it clear that he regards racism as a poison which has no place in public life."
According to the Guardian, Mr. Hester said in the meeting: "It's like trying not to be racist but you see Diane Abbott on the TV and you're just like, I hate, you just want to hate all Black women because she's there, and I don't hate all Black women at all, but I think she should be shot."
The first Black woman to be elected to Parliament, Ms. Abbott, 70, is a prominent figure in British politics and spoke on home affairs issues for the opposition Labour Party under its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
She was suspended from the Labour Party in Parliament last year pending an investigation into a letter she wrote to a newspaper calling to distinguish racism against Black people from prejudice against other groups.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, Ms. Abbott described Mr. Hester's reported comments about her as "frightening."
"I am a single woman and that makes me vulnerable anyway. But to hear someone talking like this is worrying," she said, adding that the fact that two members of Parliament "have been murdered in recent years makes talk like this all the more alarming."
A Labour lawmaker, Jo Cox, was murdered in 2016 by a right-wing extremist, and David Amess, a Conservative lawmaker, was murdered in 2021 by a radical Islamist who opposed British airstrikes against the Islamic State.
Mr. Hester is the Conservative Party's biggest donor and recently gave £5 million to the party, taking his total donations to £10 million in a year. With a general election expected later this year, the party on Tuesday was resisting pressure to return the cash.
On Tuesday afternoon, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative business and trade secretary, said that Mr. Hester's comments, "as reported, were racist," and, by the evening, Downing Street had echoed that verdict.
Earlier, another senior Conservative Party lawmaker and minister, Mel Stride, had told broadcasters that Mr. Hester's alleged comments "were clearly wrong" but people should "move on."
That did little to allay the criticism from opposition politicians. Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, described the reported comments as "abhorrent," and told the broadcaster ITV that Ms. Abbott had been a "trailblazer" who has "probably faced more abuse than any other politician over the years on a sustained basis."
Mr. Hester appeared to be "pretending that what was said wasn't racist or anything to do with the fact she's a woman," Mr. Starmer said, adding: "I don't buy that, I'm afraid, and I think that it's time the Tory Party called it out and returned the money."
Earlier, speaking in Parliament, Wes Streeting, a senior Labour lawmaker, said that the reported comments had used "utterly revolting, racist and inciteful language, which has no place in our politics and public life." Calling on the Conservatives to return donations from Mr. Hester, Mr. Streeting said that "if they have any integrity whatsoever, they will give every single penny piece back."
Some Conservative lawmakers were also critical, including Kwasi Kwarteng, who served briefly as chancellor of the Exchequer in the short-lived government of the former prime minister, Liz Truss. Mr. Kwarteng told the BBC that the comments were "clearly racist and they are clearly sexist."
Recent Conservative governments have featured some strikingly diverse cabinets and the party is led by Rishi Sunak, Britain's first nonwhite prime minister.
But the party recently suspended one of its former lawmakers, Lee Anderson, after he claimed that "Islamists" had gained control of the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, a Labour politician. On Monday Mr. Anderson formally quit the Conservative Party and joined Reform U.K., the small right-wing successor to the Brexit Party, which was once led by Nigel Farage who campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union.
Critics have accused the Conservatives of tolerating anti-Muslim hatred. In a letter sent last month to the Conservatives, Zara Mohammed, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said that "the Islamophobia in the party is institutional, tolerated by the leadership and seen as acceptable by great swathes of the party membership."
Ms. Badenoch, in her comments released on social media, said that she and Ms. Abbot "disagree on a lot. But the idea of linking criticism of her, to being a Black woman is appalling."
It was, she added, "never acceptable to conflate someone's views with the color of their skin."
However, Ms. Badenoch, who is the equalities minister as well as business and trade secretary, welcomed Mr. Hester's apology and said there "needs to be space for forgiveness" when there was contrition over flippant remarks.

What Is Happening to Our World?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: I've been The Times's foreign affairs columnist since 1995, and one of the most enduring lessons I've learned is that there are good seasons and bad seasons in this business, which are defined by the big choices made by the biggest players.
My first decade or so saw its share of bad choices -- mainly around America's response to Sept. 11 -- but they were accompanied by a lot of more hopeful ones: the birth of democracy in Russia and Eastern Europe, thanks to the choices of Mikhail Gorbachev. The Oslo peace process, thanks to the choices of Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat. China's accelerating opening to the world, thanks to the choices of Deng Xiaoping. India's embrace of globalization, thanks to choices initiated by Manmohan Singh. The expansion of the European Union, the election of America's first Black president and the evolution of South Africa into a multiracial democracy focused on reconciliation rather than retribution -- all the result of good choices from both leaders and led. There were even signs of a world finally beginning to take climate change seriously.
On balance, these choices nudged world politics toward a more positive trajectory -- a feeling of more people being connected and able to realize their full potential peacefully. It was exciting to wake up each day and think about which one of these trends to get behind as a columnist.
For the last few years, though, I've felt the opposite -- that so much of my work was decrying bad choices made by big players: Vladimir Putin's tightening dictatorship and aggression, culminating in his brutal invasion of Ukraine; Xi Jinping's reversal of China's opening; Israel's election of the most right-wing government in its history; the cascading effects of climate change; the loss of control over America's southern border; and, maybe most ominously, an authoritarian drift, not only in European countries like Turkey, Poland and Hungary but in America's own Republican Party as well.
To put it another way: If I think about the three pillars that have stabilized the world since I became a journalist in 1978 -- a strong America committed to protecting a liberal global order with the help of healthy multilateral institutions like NATO, a steadily growing China always there to buoy the world economy, and mostly stable borders in Europe and the developing world -- all three are being shaken by big choices by big players over the last decade. This is triggering a U.S.-China cold war, mass migrations from south to north and an America that has become more unreliable than indispensable.
But that's not the half of it. Because now that advanced military technologies like drones are readily available, smaller players can wield much more power and project it more widely than ever before, enabling even their bad choices to shake the world. Just look at how shipping companies across the globe are having to reroute their traffic and pay higher insurance rates today because the Houthis, Yemeni tribesmen you never heard about until recently, have acquired drones and rockets and started disrupting sea traffic around the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal.
This is why I referred to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as our first true world war, and why I feel that Hamas's war with Israel is in some ways our second true world war.
They are being fought on both physical battlefields and digital ones, with huge global reach and implications. Like farmers in Argentina who were stymied when they suddenly lost their fertilizer supplies from Ukraine and Russia. Like young TikTok users around the world observing, opining, protesting and boycotting global chains, such as Zara and McDonald's, after being enraged by something they saw on a 15-second feed from Gaza. Like a pro-Israel hacker group claiming credit for shutting down some 70 percent of Iran's gas stations the other day, presumably in retaliation for Iran's support for Hamas. And so many more.
Indeed, in today's tightly wired world, it is possible that the war over the Gaza Strip -- which is roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C. -- could decide the next president in Washington, D.C., as some young Democrats abandon President Biden because of his support for Israel.
But before we become too pessimistic, let us remember that these choices are just that: choices. There was nothing inevitable or foreordained about them. People and leaders always have agency -- and as observers we must never fall prey to the cowardly and dishonest "well, they had no choice" crowd.
Gorbachev, Deng, Anwar el-Sadat, Menachem Begin, George H.W. Bush and Volodymyr Zelensky, to name but a few, faced excruciating choices, but they chose forks in the road that led to a safer and more prosperous world, at least for a time. Others, alas, have done the opposite.
To close out the year, it's through this prism of choices that I want to re-examine the story that has consumed me, and I dare say much of the world, since Oct. 7: the Israel-Hamas war. It was not as inevitable as some want you to think.
I began thinking about this a few weeks ago, when I flew to Dubai to attend the United Nations climate summit. If you've never been there, the Dubai airport has some of the longest concourses in the world. And when my Emirates flight landed, we parked close to one end of the B concourse -- so when I looked out the window I saw lined up in a perfectly symmetrical row some 15 Emirates long-haul passenger jets, stretching far into the distance. And the thought occurred to me: What is the essential ingredient that Dubai has and Gaza lacks? Because both began, in one sense, as the convergence of sand and seawater at crucial intersections of the world.
It's not oil -- oil plays only a small role in Dubai's diversified economy today. And it's not democracy. Dubai is not a democracy and does not aspire to be one. But people are now flocking to live here from all over the world -- its population of more than 3.5 million has surged since the outbreak of Covid. Why? The short answer is visionary leadership.
Dubai has benefited from two generations of monarchs in the United Arab Emirates who had a powerful vision of how the U.A.E. in general and the emirate of Dubai in particular could choose to be Arab, modern, pluralistic, globalized and embracing of a moderate interpretation of Islam. Their formula incorporates a radical openness to the world, an emphasis on free markets and education, a ban on extremist political Islam, relatively little corruption, a strong rule of law promulgated from the top down and a relentless commitment to economic diversification, talent recruitment and development.
There are a million things one could criticize about Dubai, from labor rights for the many foreign workers who run the place to real estate booms and busts, overbuilding and the lack of a truly free press or freedom of assembly, to name but a few. But the fact that Arabs and others keep wanting to live, work, play and start businesses here indicates that the leadership has converted its intensely hot promontory on the Persian Gulf into one of the world's most prosperous crossroads for trade, tourism, transport, innovation, shipping and golf -- with a skyline of skyscrapers, one over 2,700 feet high, that would be the envy of Hong Kong or Manhattan.
And it has all been done in the shadow (and with the envy) of a dangerous Islamic Republic of Iran. When I first visited Dubai in 1980, there were still traditional wooden fishing dhows in the harbor. Today, DP World, the Emirati logistics company, manages cargo logistics and port terminals all over the world. Any of Dubai's neighbors -- Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Iran and Saudi Arabia -- could have done the same with their similar coastlines, but it was the U.A.E. that pulled it off by making the choices it made.
I toured the site of the U.N.'s global climate conference with the U.A.E.'s minister of state for international cooperation, Reem al-Hashimy, who oversaw the building of Dubai's massive 2020 Expo City, which was repurposed to hold the event. In three hours spent walking around, we were stopped at least six or seven times by young Emirati women in black robes in groups of two or three, who asked if I could just step aside for a second while they took selfies with Reem or whether I would be their photographer. She was their rock-star role model -- this Harvard- and Tufts-educated, nonroyal woman in a leadership role as a government contractor.
Compare that with Gaza, where the role models today are Hamas martyrs in its endless war with Israel.
Among the most ignorant and vile things that have been said about this Gaza war is that Hamas had no choice -- that its wars with Israel, culminating on Oct. 7 with a murderous rampage, the kidnappings of Israelis as young as 10 months and as old as 86 and the rape of Israeli women, could somehow be excused as a justifiable jailbreak by pent-up males.
No.
Let's go to the videotape: In September 2005, Ariel Sharon completed a unilateral withdrawal of all Israeli forces and settlements from Gaza, which Israel occupied in the 1967 war. In short order, Hamas began attacking the crossing points between Gaza and Israel to show that even if Israel was gone, the resistance movement wasn't over; these crossing points were a lifeline for commerce and jobs, and Israel eventually reduced the number of crossings from six to two.
In January 2006, the Palestinians held elections hoping to give the Palestinian Authority legitimacy to run Gaza and the West Bank. There was a debate among Israeli, Palestinian and Bush administration officials over whether Hamas should be allowed to run in the elections -- because it had rejected the Oslo peace accords with Israel.
Yossi Beilin, one of the Israeli architects of Oslo, told me that he and others argued that Hamas should not be allowed to run, as did many members of Fatah, Arafat's group, who had embraced Oslo and recognized Israel. But the Bush team insisted that Hamas be permitted to run without embracing Oslo, hoping that it would lose and this would be its ultimate refutation. Unfortunately, for complex reasons, Fatah ran unrealistically high numbers of candidates in many districts, dividing the vote, while the more disciplined Hamas ran carefully targeted slates and managed to win the parliamentary majority.
Hamas then faced a critical choice: Now that it controlled the Palestinian parliament, it could work within the Oslo Accords and the Paris protocol that governed economic ties between Israel, Gaza and the West Bank -- or not.
Hamas chose not to -- making a clash between Hamas and Fatah, which supported Oslo, inevitable. In the end, Hamas violently ousted Fatah from Gaza in 2007, killing some of its officials and making clear that it would not abide by the Oslo Accords or the Paris protocol. That led to the first Israeli economic blockade of Gaza -- and what would be 22 years of on-and-off Hamas rocket attacks, Israeli checkpoint openings and closings, wars and cease-fires, all culminating on Oct. 7.
These were fateful choices. Once Sharon pulled Israel out of Gaza, Palestinians were left, for the first time ever, with total control over a piece of land. Yes, it was an impoverished slice of sand and coastal seawater, with some agricultural areas. And it was not the ancestral home of most of its residents. But it was theirs to build anything they wanted.
Had Hamas embraced Oslo and chosen to build its own Dubai, not only would the world have lined up to aid and invest in it; it would have been the most powerful springboard conceivable for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, in the heart of the Palestinian ancestral homeland. Palestinians would have proved to themselves, to Israelis and to the world what they could do when they had their own territory.
But Hamas decided instead to make Gaza a springboard for destroying Israel. To put it another way, Hamas had a choice: to replicate Dubai in 2023 or replicate Hanoi in 1968. It chose to replicate Hanoi, whose Củ Chi tunnel network served as the launchpad for the '68 Tet offensive.
Hamas is not simply engaged in some pure-as-the-driven-snow anticolonial struggle against Israel. Only Hamas's useful idiots on U.S. college campuses would believe that. Hamas is engaged in a raw power struggle with Fatah over who will control Gaza and the West Bank, and it's engaged in a power struggle in the region -- alongside other pro-Muslim Brotherhood parties and regimes (like Turkey and Qatar) -- against pro-Western monarchies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the U.A.E. and military-led regimes like Egypt's.
In that struggle, Hamas wanted Gaza isolated and in conflict with Israel because that allowed Hamas to maintain its iron-fisted political and Islamist grip over the strip, foregoing elections and controlling all the smuggling routes in and out, which funded its tunnels and war machine and the lifestyle of its leaders and loyalists -- every bit as much as Iran's Islamic regime today needs its hostility with America to justify its iron grip over Iranian society and the Revolutionary Guard's control of all of its smuggling. Every bit as much as Hezbollah needs its conflict with Israel to justify building its own army inside Lebanon, controlling its drug smuggling and not permitting any Lebanese government hostile to its interests to govern, no matter who is elected. And every bit as much as Vladimir Putin needs his conflict with NATO to justify his grip on power, the militarization of Russian society and his and his cronies' looting of the state coffers.
This is now a common strategy for consolidating and holding power forever by a single political faction and disguising it with an ideology of resistance. It's no wonder they all support one another.
There is so much to criticize about Israel's occupation of the West Bank, which I have consistently opposed. But please, spare me the Harvard Yard nonsense that this war is all about the innocent, colonized oppressed and the evil, colonizing oppressors; that Israel alone was responsible for the isolation of Gaza; and that the only choice Hamas had for years was to create an underground "skyline" of tunnels up to 230 feet deep (contra Dubai) and that its only choice on Oct. 7 was martyrdom.
Hamas has never wavered from being more interested in destroying the Jewish state than in building a Palestinian state -- because that goal of annihilating Israel is what has enabled Hamas to justify its hold on power indefinitely, even though Gaza has known only economic misery since Hamas seized control.
We do those Palestinians who truly want and deserve a state of their own no favors by pretending otherwise.
Gazans know the truth. Fresh polling data reported by AFP indicates that on the eve of Oct. 7, "many Gazans were hostile to Hamas ahead of the group's brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel, with some describing its rule as a second occupation."
As Hamas's grip over Gaza is loosened, I predict we will hear a lot more of these Gazan voices on what they really think of Hamas, and it will be embarrassing to Hamas's apologists on U.S. campuses.
But our story about agency and choices does not stop there. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister -- 16 years -- also made choices. And even before this war, he made terrible ones -- for Israel and for Jews all over the world.
The list is long: Before this war, Netanyahu actively worked to keep the Palestinians divided and weak by strengthening Hamas in Gaza with billions of dollars from Qatar, while simultaneously working to discredit and delegitimize the more moderate Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, committed to Oslo and nonviolence in the West Bank. That way Netanyahu could tell every U.S. president, in effect: I'd love to make peace with the Palestinians, but they are divided, and moreover, the best of them can't control the West Bank and the worst of them control Gaza. So what do you want from me?
Netanyahu's goal has always been to destroy the Oslo option once and for all. In that, Bibi and Hamas have always needed each other: Bibi to tell the United States and Israelis that he had no choice, and Hamas to tell Gazans and its new and naïve supporters around the world that the Palestinians' only choice was armed struggle led by Hamas.
The only exit from this mutually assured destruction is to bring in some transformed version of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank -- or a whole new P.L.O.-appointed government of Palestinian technocrats -- in partnership with moderate Arab states like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. But when I raise that with many Israelis right now, they tell me, "Tom, it's not the time. No one wants to hear it."
That makes me want to scream: No, it is exactly the time. Don't they get it? Netanyahu's greatest political achievement has been to persuade Israelis and the world that it's never the right time to talk about the morally corrosive occupation and how to help build a credible Palestinian partner to take it off Israel's hands.
He and the settlers wore everyone down. When I covered the State Department in the early 1990s, West Bank settlements were routinely described by U.S. officials as "obstacles to peace." But that phrase was gradually dropped. The Trump administration even decided to stop calling the West Bank "occupied" territory.
The reason I insist on talking about these choices now is because Israel is being surrounded by what I call Iran's landcraft carriers (as opposed to our aircraft carriers): Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq. Iran is squeezing Israel into a multifront war with its proxies. I truly worry for Israel.
But Israel will have neither the sympathy of the world that it needs nor the multiple allies it needs to confront this Iranian octopus, nor the Palestinian partners it needs to govern any post-Hamas Gaza, nor the lasting support of its best friend in the world, Joe Biden, unless it is ready to choose a long-term pathway for separating from the Palestinians with an improved, legitimate Palestinian partner.
Biden has been shouting that in Netanyahu's ears in their private calls.
For all these reasons, if Netanyahu keeps refusing because, once again, politically, the time is not right for him, Biden will have to choose, too -- between America's interests and Netanyahu's.
Netanyahu has been out to undermine the cornerstone of U.S. Middle East policy for the last three decades -- the Oslo framework of two states for two people that guarantees Palestinian statehood and Israeli security, which neither side ever gave its best shot. Destroying the Oslo framework is not in America's interest.
In sum, this war is so ugly, deadly and painful, it is no wonder that so many Palestinians and Israelis want to just focus on survival and not on any of the choices that got them here. The Haaretz writer Dahlia Scheindlin put it beautifully in a recent essay:
The situation today is so terrible that people run from reality as they run from rockets -- and hide in the shelter of their blind spots. It's pointless to wag fingers. The only thing left to do is try and change that reality.
For me, choosing that path will always be in season.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Zara Pulls Ad Campaign That Spurred Outrage: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The ad campaign, which was called "The Jacket," reminded some users of Palestinians in the rubble of Gaza. Zara said it shot the campaign before the war began.
Zara, the fast-fashion retailer, said on Tuesday that it had removed an ad campaign, after critics said the imagery brought to mind scenes from the Israel-Hamas War and called it insensitive.
The campaign, which was called "The Jacket," featured the model Kristen McMenamy and was photographed by Tim Walker. In one of the images, Ms. McMenamy is holding what appears to be a mannequin wrapped in a white cloth material. In another image, what looks to be white powder is sprinkled on the floor.
"Unfortunately, some customers felt offended by these images," the fast-fashion brand said in a company statement posted Tuesday on Instagram, adding that people "saw in them something far from what was intended when they were created." The company said it "regrets that misunderstanding."
The company also noted in the statement that the campaign was conceived in July and photographed in September, before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. The campaign, which featured images of unfinished sculptures in an art studio, was developed for "the sole purpose of showcasing craftmade garments in an artistic context," the company said.
The photos posted on the company's Instagram page have since been deleted, but the batch could still be seen on The Cut and Design Scene's website.
Some customers called for a boycott of the brand over the images. Users compared the campaign's photos to recent ones taken by war photographers, in which Palestinians carry their dead loved ones in white body bags that are sometimes stained red with blood.
In one particularly poignant photo, taken by Mohammed Salem for Reuters, a Palestinian woman named Inas Abu Maamar, 36, holds the body of her 5-year-old niece, Saly, who was killed in an Israeli strike.
Critics of the campaign felt that even though it was developed before the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the decision to go ahead and release it in December was insensitive to the conflict.
"You're not aware enough of current affairs to be working in marketing," one critic posted on social media. "You approved it through ignorance."
Protesters gathered in front of a Zara store in Tunisia on Monday, according to Reuters, and they chanted while waving the Palestinian flag. Red paint was splattered on one of the store's windows.
In another video, a small group of protesters walked into what appeared to be a Zara store in Germany with tape on their mouths, waving images from the war and carrying props that appeared to simulate dead children in white body bags.
Some Instagram users added pro-Palestinian messages as comments on Zara's Instagram statement and its other recent posts.
The company has previously been tied to the conflict. In 2021, the company condemned one of its head designers, Vanessa Perilman, for sending anti-Palestinian messages online to Qaher Harhash, a Palestinian model.
The Israel strikes on Gaza made in response to the Hamas attack have been some of the most intense this century, with the Israeli military reporting in October that it had struck more than 7,000 targets in Gaza. The Biden administration announced this week that it was looking into reports by Amnesty International and The Washington Post that Israel used U.S.-supplied white phosphorus in violation of international law.

Shake Shack's Chief Will Retire Next Year
Randy Garutti, the chief executive of Shake Shack, is set to retire next year while the burger and milkshake chain gains significant momentum as it undergoes a significant expansion.
Mr. Garutti, who is also a board member, has worked for Shake Shack for more than 20 years. He plans to spend more time with his family upon retirement.
Shake Shack has opened 30 new restaurants this year and has a goal of 40 new locations in 2023. It plans to open the 40 restaurants next year, as well.
There are now more than 500 Shake Shacks in 18 countries and 33 states. The company expects to surpass $ 1 billion in revenue this year for the first time with double digit percentage growth in every one of the past 10 years.
The chain got an upgrade from Raymond James analysts last week, which say they expect fatter profit margins and the potential to increase traffic next year. Associated Press

Nvidia Announces Support For Vietnam's Work in A.I.
Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang (right), said on Monday that the company will expand its partnership with Vietnam's top tech firms and support the country in training talent for developing artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure.
Nvidia, which has already invested $ 250 million in Vietnam, has so far partnered with leading tech companies to deploy A.I. in the cloud, automotive and healthcare industries.
Reuters reported last week that Nvidia was set to discuss cooperation deals on semiconductors with Vietnamese tech companies and authorities in a meeting on Monday.
At Monday's event, Vietnam's investment minister Nguyen Chi Dzung said the country had been preparing mechanisms and incentives to attract investment projects in the semiconductor and artificial intelligence industries. Reuters

Zara Ad Campaign Sparks Outrage and a Boycott
Zara pulled an advertising campaign featuring mannequins with missing limbs and statues wrapped in white from the front page of its website and app on Monday after it prompted calls by pro-Palestine activists for a boycott of the fashion retailer.
Inditex, which owns Zara, said the change was part of its normal procedure of refreshing content. It did not comment on the boycott calls, but said the "Atelier" collection was conceived in July and the photos were taken in September. Zara said at the launch of the collection on Dec. 7 that it was inspired by men's tailoring from past centuries. The photos appear to show an artist studio with ladders, packing materials, wooden crates and cranes, and assistants wearing overalls.
Zara's Instagram account saw tens of thousands of comments posted about the photos, many with Palestinian flags, while "#BoycottZara" was trending on messaging platform X. Reuters

Garment Workers Reject Wage Hike in Bangladesh: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Unions in Bangladesh say a proposed wage increase falls short after a weekend of violent protests.
Days after violent protests over wages as low as $ 80 a month, officials in Bangladesh said on Wednesday they would increase the pay of garment workers by about 50 percent, a concession that appeared to fall short of satisfying thousands of workers who produce clothes for brands like H&M and Zara.
Over the weekend, at least two garment factory workers were killed and several police officers wounded in Gazipur District, north of Dhaka, as protesters ratcheted up their longstanding demand for higher wages. The police used tear gas to disperse protesters after some breached the gates of factories and vandalized them, leading to temporary shutdowns for manufacturers of ready-made garments that reach more than 150 countries.
The garment industry accounts for more than 80 percent of Bangladesh's annual exports of about $ 55 billion, and it is seen as the key driver of Bangladesh's economic growth in recent decades. More than 50 percent of employees in the industry are women, in a region with abysmal female participation in the formal work force. Even during Covid lockdowns, the government took measures to make sure factories remained open.
Union leaders said on Wednesday that they would continue their protests after the increase in the minimum wage announced by the government fell far short of their demand for a more than 150 percent increase for entry-level workers. They are calling for an increase to about $ 200 a month to meet the rising cost of living.
Bangladesh's wage board on Tuesday announced a 56 percent increase in the minimum wage, to about $ 113 per month. Officials also said that four other categories of wages would rise by about 50 percent. Even with a pay increase, the highest-paid bracket of workers would receive a salary of only $ 135 a month.
Prodip Ray, a leader of the Revolutionary Garment Workers Solidarity union, said factory workers had taken to the streets as repeated promises of higher wages had not materialized.
"We believe the proposed salary falls short of providing workers with the means to lead a healthy life," Mr. Ray said.
Mr. Ray, whose union is one of dozens participating in the protests, said they were increasingly worried that the protesting workers would face repercussions from the government and factory owners.
As the country's longtime leader, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, competes in an election scheduled for early next year, the story of economic success she was hoping to campaign on has unraveled, in part because of external factors like rising fuel and food costs stemming from the war in Ukraine.
At a gathering last week, Ms. Hasina appeared to blame the minimum wage protests on the opposition Bangladesh National Party, which has faced a widespread crackdown by her government, with a large number of its supporters and leaders in jail. She also warned protesters against vandalizing factories.
"Garment workers should remember that if they damage factories, they may have to return to their villages and live without employment," Ms. Hasina told the gathering in Dhaka. "We are aware of who incited these protests and acts of vandalism, and we know which individuals from B.N.P. are involved."
Low pay has long plagued Bangladesh's garment industry.
Sohel Islam, 26, a garment worker, said his salary totaled about $ 100 a month, even with the few hours of overtime he could manage.
He said he became a garment worker after his electric supply store was forced to close during the pandemic. Even though his family of three, including a 2-year-old son, has cut their consumption of protein to just once every two weeks, they still rely on aid from a brother who works in Saudi Arabia.
"I'm not sure the garment industry can provide me a better life if my salary remains like this," he said.

Full text: A benefit raised money for God's Love We Deliver, and the comedian Ziwe hosted an event for her new book.
On Monday night in Midtown Manhattan, Neil Patrick Harris, Nicky Hilton Rothschild and Michael Kors danced in their seats, as J. Harrison Ghee, the Broadway actor, sang Aretha Franklin's classic "Freeway of Love."
Ghee's performance opened the 17th annual Golden Heart Awards, the major fall fund-raiser for God's Love We Deliver, an organization that provides medically tailored meals to New Yorkers affected by severe illness, which was founded in 1986 during the AIDS epidemic.
"I think that we have to honor, and make noise about, organizations that can cut through the noise and make a difference," said Mr. Kors, a co-chair of the event and a board member of the organization.
The evening honored the Broadway star Ben Platt for excellence in the arts and the actress Scarlett Johansson for philanthropy and activism.
The gala, held at the Glasshouse event space that overlooks the Hudson River, drew about 800 people and raised more than $ 3.5 million. The space was decorated with tropical plants to resemble the restaurant Indochine, which provided some of the food. Attendees included the actors Christopher Jackson, Julianna Margulies and Beanie Feldstein; Huma Abedin, an event co-chair, author and longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and Blaine Trump, an event co-chair, who was married to Robert Trump, a late brother of former President Donald J. Trump.
While presenting Mr. Platt with his award, Cynthia Erivo reminisced about when they would meet between matinee performances of "Dear Evan Hanson" and "The Color Purple" on Broadway. Ms. Erivo said that Mr. Platt always made room for her, "even when he was exhausted, just to be there."
In tribute to Ms. Johansson, Rupert Friend, who recently appeared with the actress in Wes Anderson's film "Asteroid City," said that she made him feel "seen and heard from the get-go."
He continued: "I'm probably the only person in this room, I'm going to guess, who has ever been in a movie with Scarlett Johansson."
"That's not true. That's not true at all," a voice shouted from the crowd, as the actor Matt Damon, in a surprise appearance, walked between tables topped with greenery.
"We bought a zoo together years ago," Mr. Damon said, referencing the 2011 film "We Bought a Zoo," in which he starred alongside Ms. Johansson.
The night wound down quickly with a performance from Mary J. Blige, another surprise, as attendees were still digging into their dinner of beef fillets.
"We'd like to try and get people out of here by 10," Ms. Trump, who has been involved with the organization since the 1980s, explained in an interview. "So, you know, we're working on it."
Below, see photos from events in New York City this week.
What made you want to be here tonight?

Ziwe's Book Party at The Standard
On Tuesday night, at The Standard, East Village, a small group of friends gathered at the hotel to celebrate the release of "Black Friend," a debut collection of personal essays from Ziwe Fumudoh, a comedian known for her late-night comedy show on Showtime.
Ziwe, who goes by her first name, said she saw the book as an expansion of her work. "I have my hand in multiple pots, like a little octopus," she said.
The rooftop space, painted in white and decorated with gray couches and tables, differed from the bright pink and "feminine-with-a-wink" aesthetic often associated with the comedian.
"I found writing a book to be really difficult," Ziwe said, explaining she had to ground herself during bouts of writer's block.
"I can't expect every person to connect every single story, but if they can connect to one, that's great," she said.
Her friend Emily Ratajkowski, a model and writer who published a collection of essays in 2021, said that she sent Ziwe a text to enjoy her publication day, just as friends had reminded her two years ago.
About 50 guests, which included Brynn Whitfield and Jessel Taank, cast members of "The Real Housewives of New York City," and the director and comedian Dan Perlman, crowded around a singular bar tucked in a corner of a sprawling balcony overlooking Manhattan.
Ziwe and Ms. Ratajkowski took turns taking photos of each other posing on the balcony with its sweeping view of the city; later, Ziwe took selfies with Jaboukie Young-White, the writer and comedian, in the elevator.
"Our friend wrote a book!" said Jen Goma, an entertainer, who met Ziwe years ago. "There is something about our small circle rising up -- and it is a celebration."

Full text: A widening conflict would test Israel's economic resilience while worsening an already bleak outlook for the Palestinian economy.
As the fighting between Israel and Hamas risks bursting into regionwide chaos, the prospect of a long and potentially widening war could pile economic havoc atop a devastating human toll.
For Gaza, a broader conflict would almost certainly deepen the already worsening humanitarian conditions in the territory. And Israel faces a fresh blow to a resilient economy that until recently had been hailed as an entrepreneurial powerhouse.
The outlook for the Palestinian economy was already dire before Israel declared a siege of Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks, creating what the World Health Organization called a "humanitarian catastrophe." An assessment this year by the International Monetary Fund said Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip and increased restrictions on the West Bank were significant obstacles to growth and private sector development.
In Israel, as many as 360,000 reservists are leaving their jobs and businesses to mobilize for military duty, bringing parts of the economy to a standstill. Israel's technology industry, a driver of growth, has abruptly slowed. Production at a major Israeli offshore natural gas field has been shut down. The central bank has committed billions of dollars to prevent Israel's currency, the shekel, from collapsing.
The conflagration caps a troubling period for an economy that had been riding high, ranked by The Economist last year as the fourth-best-performing economy among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Israel's start-ups have attracted billions in foreign investment. The Abraham Accords, which were signed in 2020 and established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries, opened a path toward more economic prosperity. Israel is also developing a hub for exporting natural gas to Europe and beyond.
But the economy started to stumble this year after a right-wing government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, advanced a contentious plan to rein in the power of the judiciary that critics said could potentially weaken the rule of law, inciting millions of Israelis to protest in the streets. Many tech leaders have threatened to leave the country over the judicial overhaul, saying it would undermine Israel's standing, and warned of an economic downdraft.
The overhaul set off a 60 percent plunge in foreign investment in Israel, and it has hastened an erosion in the shekel's value and wide swings in the Israeli stock market. High interest rates, rising inflation and expectations of a slowdown in the global economy were also weighing on growth.
The government's zeal in pursuit of judicial change generated uncertainty among investors, and "caused money to move out," said Dan Ben-David, the founder of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research and a professor at Tel Aviv University.
"Going into this, we already had an economic problem," he said. "And then came the Hamas attack."
Aggravating the shock, Mr. Ben-David added, is that many of the reservists being called to serve in the military are tech entrepreneurs, teachers, lawyers and other secular Israelis, while ultra-Orthodox men are excused for religious reasons. That has concentrated the pool of recruits around people who make up the bulk of Israel's entrepreneurial economic activity.
Two credit ratings agencies this week warned that Israel's debt could be downgraded. On Friday Moody's said that the conflict was "more severe than the episodes of violence in the last few decades," creating the risk of a diversion of resources in the economy, decreased investment and a loss of confidence.
And the Fitch ratings agency warned on Tuesday of the "heightened risk of a widening of Israel's current conflict to include large-scale military confrontations with multiple actors, over a sustained period of time." Just six months ago, Fitch cited Israel's "strong economic growth." A ratings downgrade could force Israel to pay higher interest when it borrows.
Goldman Sachs said in a note Monday that the risks to Israel's financial and economic stability appeared to be lower, for now, than during previous major conflicts because Israel's overall finances were stronger today and the country had a large stock of foreign exchange reserves.
The Bank of Israel has about $ 200 billion in foreign exchange reserves -- close to 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- which its governor, Amir Yaron, told I.M.F. and World Bank officials in a video call on Sunday provided ample capacity to support the economy. Since the conflict, the central bank has earmarked $ 30 billion in foreign exchange to support the shekel, which has fallen to an eight-year low.
The central bank is facing a quandary: Reduce interest rates to help bolster the wartime economy, or keep them elevated to support the shekel. The bank is scheduled to announce its decision on Monday.
Any war is likely to affect Israel's finances, Mr. Yaron said, but the government could make budget adjustments to adapt to the conflict. Israel regularly spends over 4 percent of gross domestic product on the military -- amounting to $ 23.4 billion last year -- and receives an additional cushion in the form of $ 3.8 billion in annual aid from the United States, used mainly to buy American weapons. In the coming days President Biden is expected to ask Congress for $ 14 billion in military and security aid for Israel.
Goldman told clients in its note that it expected Israeli financial authorities to "remain cautious due to potential risks for the conflict to escalate further."
The economic situation for Palestinians on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank has been notoriously worse.
An annual I.M.F. review in August described the heavy toll to the Palestinian economy and people from persistent poverty and high unemployment. The outlook remained "bleak amid a volatile political and security situation," the I.M.F. concluded, adding that any turnaround would hinge on the "easing of Israeli-imposed restrictions on movement, access and investment," as well as a political peace settlement.
Israel's siege of Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks has destroyed infrastructure and led to dire shortages of food, water, gasoline and other essentials, and the displacement of about half of Gaza's more than two million Palestinians. An expansion of the conflict to include Hamas's Iranian-backed ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon would be a development that some feared would multiply the regional despair.
In Israel, activity in many sectors of the economy has slowed or ground to halt. The tourism business has come to a near standstill, with cruise ships avoiding Israel's shores and people canceling visits. Major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, including for cargo. On Monday, UPS said it had stopped flying to Israel. Sea freight operations have faced additional controls by the Israeli Navy, affecting cargo shipments. Israel, which relies heavily on imported oil, has shut one of its two main oil ports for safety reasons, analysts said.
Tech companies and start-ups reported that many of their younger employees had been mobilized. Nvidia, the world's largest maker of chips used for artificial intelligence and computer graphics, said it had canceled an A.I. summit that was scheduled to take place in Tel Aviv. Retailers, including H&M and Zara, have shut stores in the country.
The Israel-Gaza conflict could also slow natural gas investment in the area, analysts said, hurting the ambitions of Israel and the wider region, which have recently received a lift from Chevron to become a hub for exporting natural gas to Europe and elsewhere.
Mr. Yaron, the central bank governor, said on Sunday that the Israeli economy had "known how to function and to recover from difficult periods in the past, and to return to prosperity rapidly."
Even so, Mr. Yaron said, with many reserve soldiers at the front lines and civilians in shelters because of rocket attacks, there will be an effect on real economic activity. And war, he added, was "likely to persist in the coming period."

Cassidy Hutchinson's Subtle Refinements: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the former White House aide goes on a book tour, frankly discussing the men who felt free to comment on and assess her appearance, she has a more relaxed look.
After Cassidy Hutchinson's history-making testimony before the Jan. 6 committee last year, threats to her personal safety compelled her to leave Washington, go into hiding and eschew all public appearances. Now she's back, in a big way, publicizing her new memoir, "Enough." And for her book tour, Ms. Hutchinson has been refining her style.
On camera during her testimony, Ms. Hutchinson's style was muted and tailored (she wears the same look on her book jacket). A blowout, blazer, fitted black pants and black top, tiny circle diamond necklace, and a white manicure. Her Zara jacket was white, too -- a color associated with purity, the suffragists; the color of the Capitol building that had been breached and sullied on Jan. 6.
That structured, buttoned white blazer allied Ms. Hutchinson visually with the Capitol. White also suggested that Ms. Hutchinson was turning over a fresh page, moving away from Trumpworld (and the President Trump-affiliated attorneys who'd encouraged her to answer questions with "I don't recall"), and offering the committee her full cooperation -- total candor. The word "candor," in fact, derives from a Latin word for "whiteness."
When Ms. Hutchinson resurfaced on "The Rachel Maddow Show" this September, her outfit recalled her look of last spring -- but with notable differences. This time, while she spoke of her ongoing loyalty to the Republican Party (calling herself a "moderate Republican"), her blazer was of brightest blue -- a potential nod at least to the other side of the aisle. Beneath that jacket she wore a drapey, low-neck top of high-gloss white silk. The blouse's high-sheen fabric and cut added glamour, suggesting a new, more relaxed stance and ease in the spotlight. And Ms. Hutchinson did seem more relaxed and unguarded -- in both demeanor and in what she had to say.
Some of what she had to say actually involved clothing and style -- including startling details about the powerful Republican men who had felt free to comment on and assess her appearance, even to touch her body.
Ms. Hutchinson claims, for example, that on Jan. 6, 2021, at Mr. Trump's rally, Rudolph Giuliani groped her under her jacket and skirt. The episode, which she discussed on the Maddow show, is also vividly described in "Enough": "Rudy wraps one arm around my body, closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents press into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his free hand reach for the hem of my blazer. 'By the way,' he says, 'I'm loving this leather jacket on you.' His hand slips under my blazer, then my skirt. I feel his frozen fingertips trail up my thigh."
On the very day the Capitol would be overrun by rioters, whom Mr. Giuliani approvingly exhorted to "have trial by combat," Ms. Hutchinson says he let his icy hand overrun her personal, physical boundaries. This display of entitlement, disrespect, and abuse of power mirrored, in microcosm, the transgression Mr. Giuliani would condone at the Capitol. And yet it was all couched in a fashion compliment.
Other high-ranking men also felt free to assess Ms. Hutchinson's style choices. As she recounted to Ms. Maddow, John Boehner, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, once intrusively tugged on the ends of her hair and told her to "lose the ponytail." (To grasp how strange this is, imagine a male politician reaching over another man's shirt collar to finger his tresses.)
Mr. Trump -- known for taking great interest in his female staff's appearance -- weighed in as well on Ms. Hutchinson's hair: He counseled her to visit the salon frequented by the former communications director (and former Ralph Lauren model) Hope Hicks, even advising her to emulate Ms. Hicks's specific look. "Cassidy," she recalls him telling her, "you should get some of her highlights. I think they would look really nice on you." Ms. Hutchinson lightened her hair immediately, a choice she says she later regretted. But she had internalized an ethos in which not even her body -- the way she groomed and presented her physical self -- was exempt from the oversight of her superiors, especially the president.
A remarkable passage in "Enough" makes this point even more starkly: Ms. Hutchinson recalls being sworn in before testifying to the Jan. 6 committee. Raising her right hand to take the oath, she noticed that the motion made her white blazer sleeve bunch up around her forearm. "Trump will hate this," she recalls thinking to herself. "He hates when women wear ill-fitting clothes."
Even at this landmark moment, as she swore to reveal truths deeply damaging to Mr. Trump, Ms. Hutchinson could not shake her sense of his gaze upon her -- imagining his displeasure, not at the words she was about to speak, but at her attire.
Now though, Ms. Hutchinson seems to be owning her style choices. On CBS News Sunday Morning, she strode the beach in jeans and a cozy sweater. And on "The Last Word With Lawrence O'Donnell," she forewent her usual businesslike blazer, and leaned into slouchy glamour in a soft, almost pajama-like, dark green silk button-down, open at the collar. The cocktail-ish look complemented well the very different tenor -- and more revealing nature -- of this interview.
While she spoke at length about the Trump White House, Ms. Hutchinson also got more personal, allowing Mr. O'Donnell to draw her out on the subject of her family. She spoke, as she does in her book, of struggling to gain the approval of her erratic father, an avid supporter of Mr. Trump. ("You don't know how to love without conditions," Ms. Hutchinson recounts telling her father.)
The interview and the memoir clearly suggest that a lifetime of coping with her father's transactional approach to relationships, and his volatile and often cruel behavior -- especially after she breaks with Mr. Trump -- may well have "primed Hutchinson to succumb to the alternate reality of Trumpworld," as Laura Miller wrote for Slate. It's a chilling reminder of how closely the personal and the political can be interwoven.
But the personal and the political can interact in more benign, even inspiring ways: In "Enough," Ms. Hutchinson explains why her mother chose to give her the middle name, "Jacqueline": "Jacqueline Kennedy, was one of the most intelligent, elegant, and generous souls Mom knew of ... she hoped I would look to Jacqueline Kennedy as a role model." And in fact, there is a whisper of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' style today in Ms. Hutchinson's media persona -- the unadorned sleekness of her clothes and hair (even her color palette); her soft-spoken and diplomatic responses -- often to probing, even intrusive questions. A subdued yet arresting presence emerging from a moment of national crisis.

In Moscow, War in Background but Ever-Present: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Muscovites go about their daily lives with little major disruption. But the war's effects are evident -- in the stores, at the movies and in the increasingly repressive environment.
Metro trains are running smoothly in Moscow, as usual, but getting around the city center by car has become more complicated, and annoying, because anti-drone radar interferes with navigation apps.
There are well-off Muscovites ready to buy Western luxury cars, but there are not enough available. And while a local election for mayor took place as it normally would last Sunday, many of the city's residents decided not to vote, with the result seemingly predetermined (a landslide win by the incumbent).
Almost 19 months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Muscovites are experiencing dual realities: The war has faded into background noise, causing few major disruptions, and yet it remains ever-present in their daily lives.
This month, Moscow is aflutter in red, white and blue flags for the annual celebration of the Russian capital's birthday, No. 876. Its leaders marked the occasion with a monthlong exhibition that ended last Sunday. Featuring the country's largest hologram, it showcased the city of 13 million people as a smoothly operating metropolis with a bright future. More than seven million people visited, according to the organizers.
There is little anxiety among residents over the drone strikes that have hit Moscow this summer. No alarm sirens to warn of a possible attack. When flights are delayed because of drone threats in the area, the explanation is usually the same as the one plastered on signs at the shuttered luxury boutiques of Western designers: "technical reasons."
The city continues to grow. Cranes dot the skyline, and there are high-rise buildings going up all over town. New brands, some homegrown, have replaced the flagship stores like Zara and H&M, which departed after the invasion began in February 2022.
"We continue to work, to live and to raise our children," said Anna, 41, as she walked by a sidewalk memorial marking the death of the Wagner mercenary leader Yevgeny V. Prigozhin. She said she worked in a government ministry, and like others interviewed, she did not give her last name because of a fear of retribution.
But for some, the effects of war are landing harder.
Nina, 79, a pensioner who was shopping at an Auchan supermarket in northwestern Moscow, said that she had stopped buying red meat entirely, and that she could almost never afford to buy a whole fish.
"Just right now, in September, the prices rose tremendously," she said.
Nina said that sanctions and ubiquitous construction projects were some reasons for higher prices, but the main reason, she said, was "because a lot is spent on war."
"Why did they start it at all?" Nina added. "Such a burden on the country, on people, on everything. And people are disappearing -- especially men."
When asked about the biggest problems facing Russia, more than half of the respondents in a recent poll by the independent Levada Center cited price increases. The war, known in Russia as the "special military operation," came in second, with 29 percent, tied with "corruption and bribery."
"In principle, everything is getting more expensive," said Aleksandr, 64, who said he worked as an executive director in a company. His shopping habits at the grocery store have not changed, but he said he had not traded in his luxury Western-branded car for a newer model.
"First of all, there are no cars," he said, noting that most Western dealerships had left Russia and that Chinese brands had been taking their places on the roads.
The war has made itself evident outside supermarkets and auto dealerships. Moscow may be one of the few cities in Europe without sold-out showings of the movie "Barbie." Warner Bros, which produced the film, pulled out of Russia shortly after Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine, and bootleg copies of "Barbie" were shown only in a few underground screenings.
Theaters regularly show movies that premiered more than five years ago because of licensing issues and strict new laws banning any mention of L.G.B.T.Q. people.
Advertisements to join the military are plastered on roadside billboards and on posters in convenience stores. Moscow's metro recently stopped making announcements in English, with a Russian-language voice announcing every stop twice.
Cosmetically, Moscow is changing, too. A statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet political police, was inaugurated this past week in front of the headquarters of the foreign intelligence services. It is a copy of a statue that stood in front of the headquarters of the K.G.B. until it was torn down in 1991 by Russians hungry for freedom.
The election for mayor also underscored the sea change in Russian politics. A decade ago, the opposition politician Aleksei A. Navalny stood as a candidate against Sergei S. Sobyanin. Now, Mr. Navalny is in jail, and there was no real competition for Mr. Sobyanin, who won a third term with an unprecedented 76 percent of the vote.
Other parties, including the Communist Party, fielded a candidate against the incumbent, but they are all considered "systemic opposition" parties, or groups in Parliament nominally in opposition but who align their policies with the Kremlin on most issues.
"Before the war, I still voted," said Vyacheslav I. Bakhmin, a chairman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, the oldest human rights group in Russia. "I don't want to vote now because, well, the result seems to be clear, right?"
Many in Moscow chose not to vote, though turnout was at a two-decade high because of electronic voting that allows Muscovites to cast a ballot online. There is also heavy-handed encouragement of public sector employees to vote.
Mr. Sobyanin, 65, benefited from a carefully cultivated image as an effective manager, and Moscow's cleanliness and ease of getting around are praised even by people who oppose his political party. He has made transportation a hallmark of his tenure, and he not only keeps the trains running efficiently, but is opening brand-new stations.
The elections in Moscow and in more than 20 Russian regions are widely seen as a test run for presidential elections in March. Mr. Putin has not declared his candidacy, but he is widely expected to run.
As Mr. Putin presides over a war with no end in sight, the authorities have worked to limit public expressions of dissent and make things seem as normal as possible. Aleksei A. Venediktov, who headed the liberal Echo of Moscow radio station before the Kremlin shut it down last year, said that the government had engineered the war's absence from political spaces.
"This war, it is mainly on TV, or on Telegram channels, but it is not on the street, it is not even discussed in cafes and restaurants, because it is dangerous, because the laws that have been adopted are repressive," Mr. Venediktov said. He noted cases in which people expressing antiwar views were denounced -- or in some cases reported to the police -- by those sitting next to them on the subway or in restaurants.
"People prefer to tell one another, 'Let's not talk about it here,"' Mr. Venediktov said. "And that's why you can't see it in the mood."
In Moscow City, an area of skyscrapers that is the Russian capital's answer to New York's Financial District, many people casually dismissed a series of drone strikes that damaged some of the buildings there but resulted in no casualties.
One woman, Olga, who said she worked nearby, just nodded as a colleague shrugged off the potential risk.
Later, Olga sent a New York Times journalist a message on the Telegram messaging app: "I couldn't say anything, because at work they don't talk about a position like mine," she wrote. "I am against war and I hate our political system."
When there is a drone strike inside Russia, she said, "I always hope that maybe someone will think about what it means to live under shelling, and regret the loss of our normal life before the war." She said that if the explosions do not cause casualties, then "I don't regret damage to the buildings at all."
Mr. Venediktov said that even if changes on Moscow's surface were hard to see, and increasingly harder to discuss, people were truly transforming inside.
"People are starting to return to the Soviet practice, when public conversations can lead to trouble at work," he said. "It's like toxic poisoning -- a very slow process."

MOSCOW — Metro trains are running smoothly in Moscow, as usual, but getting around the city center by car has become more complicated, and annoying, because anti-drone radar interferes with navigation apps.

It is a copy of a statue that stood in front of the headquarters of the KGB until it was torn down in 1991 by Russians hungry for freedom.
The election for mayor also underscored the sea change in Russian politics. A decade ago, opposition politician Alexei Navalny stood as a candidate against Sergey Sobyanin, 65. Now Navalny is in jail, and there was no real competition for Sobyanin, who won a third term with an unprecedented 76% of the vote.
Other parties, including the Communist Party, fielded a candidate against the incumbent, but they are all considered “systemic opposition” parties, or groups in parliament nominally in opposition but who align their policies with the Kremlin on most issues.
“Before the war, I still voted,” said Vyacheslav Bakhmin, a chair of the Moscow Helsinki Group, the oldest human rights group in Russia. “I don’t want to vote now because, well, the result seems to be clear, right?”
Many in Moscow chose not to vote, although turnout was at a two-decade high because of electronic voting that allows Muscovites to cast a ballot online. There is also heavy-handed encouragement of public-sector employees to vote.
Sobyanin benefited from a carefully cultivated image as an effective manager, and Moscow’s cleanliness and ease of getting around are praised even by people who oppose his political party. He has made transportation a hallmark of his tenure, and he not only keeps the trains running efficiently but also is opening brand-new stations.
The elections in Moscow and in more than 20 Russian regions are widely seen as a test run for presidential elections in March. Putin has not declared his candidacy, but he is widely expected to run.
As Putin presides over a war with no end in sight, authorities have worked to limit public expressions of dissent and make things seem as normal as possible. Alexei Venediktov, who headed the liberal Echo of Moscow radio station before the Kremlin shut it down last year, said that the government had engineered the war’s absence from political spaces.
“This war, it is mainly on TV, or on Telegram channels, but it is not on the street. It is not even discussed in cafes and restaurants, because it is dangerous, because the laws that have been adopted are repressive,” Venediktov said. He noted cases in which people expressing anti-war views were denounced — or in some cases reported to the police — by those sitting next to them on the subway or in restaurants.
“People prefer to tell one another, ‘Let’s not talk about it here,’” Venediktov said. “And that’s why you can’t see it in the mood.”
In Moscow City, an area of skyscrapers that is the Russian capital’s answer to New York’s Financial District, many people casually dismissed a series of drone strikes that damaged some of the buildings there but resulted in no casualties.
One woman, Olga, who said she worked nearby, just nodded as a colleague shrugged off the potential risk.
Later, Olga sent a New York Times journalist a message on the Telegram messaging app: “I couldn’t say anything, because at work they don’t talk about a position like mine,” she wrote. “I am against war and I hate our political system.”
When there is a drone strike inside Russia, she said, “I always hope that maybe someone will think about what it means to live under shelling, and regret the loss of our normal life before the war.” She said that if the explosions do not cause casualties, then “I don’t regret damage to the buildings at all.”
Venediktov said that even if changes on Moscow’s surface were hard to see and increasingly harder to discuss, people were truly transforming inside.
“People are starting to return to the Soviet practice, when public conversations can lead to trouble at work,” he said. “It’s like toxic poisoning — a very slow process.”

Full text: The fashion world came out to honor the star photographer. He didn't show.
At a cocktail party in Lower Manhattan on Friday to celebrate a new collection of clothing and accessories designed by the fashion photographer Steven Meisel for Zara, practically the only boldface name who didn't show up was Steven Meisel.
"I would have been surprised if he had come," said Edward Enninful, the editor in chief of British Vogue, standing outside the event space on Howard Street as the model Kaia Gerber walked by. "He's shy. He lets the work speak for itself."
If Mr. Meisel were a movie star, said another guest, the writer James Reginato, he'd be Greta Garbo.
Mr. Meisel's photo spreads are known for their inventive and often satirical narratives. In "Makeover Madness," a 2005 feature for Italian Vogue, Linda Evangelista posed as a couture-clad socialite with a plastic surgery addiction.
Ms. Evangelista was one of many models at the party, along with a number of editors, stylists and other fashion-world people who have worked with Mr. Meisel.
He seems to be having a moment. In addition to the Zara collaboration, Phaidon is publishing a book this month, "Linda Evangelista Photographed by Steven Meisel." On Oct. 6, Christie's is holding an auction titled "Madonna x Meisel -- the Sex Photographs" of more than 40 photos from Madonna's 1992 coffee table book, "Sex."
Mr. Meisel, who shot the cover for Madonna's 1984 album, "Like a Virgin," was her chief collaborator for "Sex." She has credited him with teaching her to treat each photo shoot as "a small film" and to transform in each into a new character. "He was the first person to introduce me to the idea of reinvention," Madonna once said in an interview with Vogue.
Several models at the party spoke of how Mr. Meisel had either found signature looks for them or changed their appearances in ways they had not imagined.
Karen Elson, who made her name with a goth princess look, was decked out in a black trench coat that Mr. Meisel had designed for Zara. She said that when she met Mr. Meisel in 1996, she was "a mousy strawberry blond." On their second shoot together, for Italian Vogue, Mr. Meisel tried something new.
"They shaved my eyebrows off and colored my hair red," Ms. Elson said. "It was the first time I saw myself, if that makes sense. Steven has this uncanny ability to make his subjects feel seen. It was like I had been transformed into who I am, and that's something magical he possesses. They call him a Svengali for a reason."
The model Joan Smalls recalled working with Mr. Meisel on a Moschino ad campaign in which he spoofed a TV series from the '80s where "all the women hate each other."
If only she could remember the name of the show.
"'Dynasty'?" a reporter asked.
"Yes, that's it. Exactly," she said. "It was just so much fun."
Mr. Meisel long ago stopped going to events where he might be photographed. But everyone in fashion knows his look: androgynous, with long black hair and all black clothes, with a punk edge. His designs for Zara were of a piece with that. "It's his uniform," the model Karolina Kurkova said as she picked out a black leather biker cap from the racks.
A few feet away, the hairstylist Julien d'Ys was trying on a faux-fur winter hat that suggested a mash-up of Dr. Zhivago and Rick Owens. Mr. d'Ys described how Mr. Meisel had brought him to New York in the early '80s to meet the designer Stephen Sprouse.
Mr. Sprouse and Mr. Meisel had worked together in the '70s, under the designer Halston. Mr. Sprouse, who died in 2004, was the studio manager. Mr. Meisel, a gifted illustrator, was responsible for providing the Halston seamstresses with drawings that served as blueprints. But he did not get along with the boss, who derisively nicknamed him "Pocahontas," Mr. Meisel told Vogue in a rare interview in 2009.
After some time at Women's Wear Daily, Mr. Meisel was brought to Condé Nast by its editorial director, Alexander Liberman, and began shooting for many of its publications. Prada, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton and Versace started calling on him for ad campaigns. In those days, Mr. Meisel went everywhere -- Mudd Club, Area, Marc Jacobs shows. The reclusive part, Mr. d'Ys said, came later.
In 2009, when the International Center of Photography staged an exhibition featuring Mr. Meisel's work, the Vogue editor Anna Wintour assigned a profile of Mr. Meisel. The result was an article suggesting that a possible reason for his reclusiveness was insecurity about his weight.
After that, Mr. Meisel shot for American Vogue only sporadically. Asked about the apparent deterioration of the magazine's relationship with Mr. Meisel, Ms. Wintour said in an email, "Steven is an absolutely brilliant photographer, someone whose work defines our era and Vogue's history, and I admire him so much."
At a little past 6 p.m., Tonne Goodman, a former fashion director at Vogue, made a beeline to Ms. Evangelista, who was decked out in a black oversize Meisel for Zara blazer along with her own billowing black skirt and a pair of Meisel-designed biker boots.
"Aren't they great?" she said.
Mr. d'Ys gave Ms. Evangelista a kiss hello, which turned into a long embrace.
"He gave me my original haircut!" Ms. Evangelista said, recalling a shoot from early in her career, when Mr. Meisel was behind the camera and Mr. d'Ys styled her hair. "He's the one who made me cry."
As Ms. Evangelista told it, she wasn't prepared at the beginning to change her look so drastically. But that's what it was like working with Mr. Meisel.
A reporter asked her why he appeared to be having a resurgence.
"But is it a resurgence?" Ms. Evangelista said. "I don't know. I think he's done a few things all at the same time, and there is this younger generation that's coming to appreciate him now and discover him, I guess."
"He's legendary," she continued. "We all go into our quieter moments and then resurface. It's not like he ever went away. Not like me."

Fast-Fashion Leaders Shein And Forever 21 Team Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Holman, Jordyn

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shein, the e-commerce giant known for ultralow prices, frequently refreshed stock and questions about working conditions in its supply chain, could sell within Forever 21 stores.
Shein, the e-commerce retailer founded in China, is teaming up with the parent of Forever 21 to expand its reach into Americans' closets. The tie-up will bring together two of the biggest names in the fast-fashion sector online and in malls across the country.
As part of the agreement, Shein could one day operate stores-within-stores at Forever 21 outlets, while Forever 21's clothes would be sold on Shein's site. The deal also includes investments from each partner in shares of the other.
In the early 2000s, Forever 21 helped popularize the concept of fast fashion to American shoppers, standing out in malls with a revolving carousel of $ 5 tops and $ 10 dresses that hit racks more quickly than traditional department store schedules.
Shein, founded in 2012 and now based in Singapore, has gained popularity among American shoppers in recent years by taking fast fashion to the next level. The company's technology and supply chain allow for hundreds of new styles to be made in weeks, offering shoppers, especially teenagers and 20-somethings, more options tailored to every shift in taste.
Known for its ultralow prices, Shein says its app has 150 million users around the world. It has also experimented with pop-up shops in the United States before.
Shein will acquire about one-third of the shares of Sparc Group, which has owned Forever 21 since the retailer emerged from bankruptcy in 2020. Sparc is a joint venture between the conglomerate Authentic Brands Group and the mall operator Simon Property Group. As part of the deal, Sparc, whose portfolio also includes Brooks Brothers and Eddie Bauer, will become a minority shareholder in Shein.
"We look forward to finding new ways to delight our customers through the potential of this partnership," Donald Tang, Shein's executive director, said in a statement.
Shein is a formidable force, said Jessica Ramirez, a retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. But Forever 21 has something that Shein doesn't: a large portfolio of stores.
"As much as you don't want to have too much brick and mortar," Ms. Ramirez said, physical locations give customers an opportunity to interact more meaningfully with a brand's products. For now, Shein's business is driven by "how convenient it is and how cheap it is and how many styles that are on trend that they are able to offer."
Shein has faced criticism for how and where it produces its products, and has been accused of using forced labor and copying independent designers' work. The company has denied using forced labor and cotton from the Xinjiang region of China. The U.S. government has banned imports from the region based on concerns about human rights abuses against Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim group. Shein recently formed a program for independent designers in which it pays them to make apparel and goods for the company.
In June, Shein faced a public relations fiasco for sending a group of influencers on a trip to some of its factories in China. The influencers faced blowback on social media after posting that they did not see any issues with working conditions at the factories, a recurring source of controversy swirling around the company.
Forever 21 has faced challenges of its own. In 2019, it filed for bankruptcy and closed more than 30 percent of its stores in the United States as shoppers strayed from malls. It faced increased competition from both brick-and-mortar peers and digitally savvy competitors like H&M, Zara, Fashion Nova and, of course, Shein.

Pink Is Everywhere. Can It Please Go Away?: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hey Barbie, there is a fine line between reclaiming a color and ruining it.
I admit it: If I never have to see another piece of "Barbie" pink merch; if I never receive another email touting how to "Barbie-fy" my wardrobe, or celebrating the Zara x Barbie collection and the Balmain x Barbie collection and "Pink Eyewear Must-haves" from Privé Revaux, or calling out a "pink mania alert"; if I never again type "Barbie" into the Google search bar only to be faced by pink fireworks and a pink results page -- I will be happy.
I know this may not be a popular opinion. But after a full year of buildup (it was in June 2022 that those pictures of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in their neon rollerblading outfits were released), after 100 official brand partnerships in what Variety called the "pink publicity machine" and after the climax of the opening weekend, in which "Barbie" took in more money than any film by a female director ever (get ready for a spate of stories about the power of the "pink purse") and viewers flooded theaters in their own Barbie pink, I am choking on pink. Drenched in pink.
Ready to take Pepto-Bismol for all the pink, except -- it's pink too.
I understand why Issa Rae -- President Barbie herself! -- on the promotional tour before the actor's strike, announced that she was planning to "burn" all her pink. And I can't help but wonder whether, once the excitement over the movie dissipates, we will see the Barbie pink period as a sort of mass fashion hallucination. If whether, in the pell-mell rush to embrace the color -- to reclaim it as a triumph of ironic feminism -- the Barbie hype has sowed the seeds of pink's destruction.
It was not always thus. In the beginning, the return of Barbie pink was exciting, in a high-camp, postmodern, conceptual kind of way; a way that reframed a relationship to pink that had been poisoned by the marketing of gender stereotype back in the 1970s.
There is a reason the cover of David Batchelor's 2000 book "Chromophobia," which posits that historically the color has been seen as feminine and anti-intellectual, is Barbie pink.
"Pink is the most controversial color in fashion history," said Valerie Steele, the director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology and author of "Pink: the History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Color." "It has so many contradictory meanings. It has fully entered our bloodstream like a virus, and now different variants keep emerging."
"Barbie" seemed to herald the third leg of historical troika. First came millennial pink, that comforting dusty rose pink that reflected a generational and dual gender nostalgia for the swaddling innocence of childhood. Then the bright pink of the pussy hat pink, a rebellious, in-your-face-pink of feminine protest. And now, Barbie pink, the most artificial, commercialized, almost tacky, unmistakable pink of all -- number 219 on the Pantone color chart.
It is a pink that Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said, "is considered a 'hot pink,' a close descendant of the 'mother color' red, taking on some of the dynamism, energy and theatrical aspect of red, but tempered somewhat so that it is not quite as aggressive." Also, she said, it is a pink that is "impossible to ignore."
In celebrating it as it celebrates the multilayered reality of women, the film imbues it with new meaning: from girl power at its most clichéd and cheesy to girl power at its most complex. Even those of us who never really embraced the color, wardrobe-wise, could appreciate the irony and applaud it.
Except that meaning has been drowned in the flurry of marketing that has ensued. It's starting to feel like pinxploitation. When even politicians see pink as a strategic tool, be it Gretchen Whitmer and her Governor Barbie or Kyrsten Sinema and her Twitter (she posted twin photos of herself in hot pink and glasses, to demonstrate her "Barbenheimer" appeal), a detox may be in order. There are other colors in the film, after all: butter yellow, baby blue, all that neon, burgundy. Neither the movie nor the women it celebrates should be reduced to a single shade.
I know I am not the only one who thinks so. In July, at the couture shows in Paris, during a preview with Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, who did as much as anyone to popularize very, very bright pink thanks to his fall 2022 show, which featured a collection done almost exclusively in "Pink PP" and which became a popular red carpet trend with celebrities like Anne Hathaway and Zendaya, I asked him if he was riding the Barbie wave and including more pink in his collection.
He made a bit of a face and shook his head. He had made a custom look for Margot Robbie's press tour (a polka-dot halter mini) because he thought it was fun, but aside from that, he said, he "preferred to stay away." Going pinkalicious once was a statement, but twice was ... well, a box.
Likewise, at Schiaparelli, a house so synonymous with shocking pink that a 2022 exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs was called "Shocking!," the color Daniel Roseberry, its current designer, chose to focus on in his couture show was Yves Klein blue.
And in the latest issue of Australian Vogue, with Ms. Robbie on the cover, the actress is pictured not in the plethora of pink that she modeled in the June issue of American Vogue, but in goth-y pleated red Balenciaga, transparent plastic Rabanne and, most of all, black: black Gucci, black Louis Vuitton and black Chanel.
Even she, it seems, is pinked out.

Home Décor Joins Lineup At Outfitter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Responding to a volatile market for work clothes, the retailer hopes that selling home goods will help stabilize its business.
Inside Banana Republic's design studio in San Francisco, Sandra Stangl, the company's chief executive, pointed to an item that had been creating buzz in stores.
It was not a shirt or dress draped on a mannequin. Instead, Ms. Stangl walked toward a king-size bed with a parchment-colored backboard. The company has started putting these bed frames, which sell for around $ 5,000, near the front of its stores in Los Angeles and New York. Enough shoppers have asked if they were for sale -- the answer: Not yet, but Ms. Stangl and her team are taking a limited number of pre-orders for the fall.
Shoppers usually think about outfitting themselves, not their homes, when they walk into Banana Republic. But the brand is trying to change that. In March, the retailer announced it would begin selling home textiles, and since then it has rolled out items like throw blankets, rugs and the attention-grabbing bed frames, selling home products online and in 16 of its stores.
The home category "gives us a bigger addressable audience," Ms. Stangl said, standing in front of an embroidered linen and cotton duvet, which the company says is a best seller. She added that offering home goods "stabilizes out the business a little bit."
Throughout the pandemic, the shopping environment for apparel retailers took on a boom-bust pattern. Shoppers stuck at home were first buying yoga pants, then sought work-appropriate clothes when a full-scale return to the office seemed imminent. Now, as many people's day-to-day lives have settled into more of a hybrid situation, consumers are being even more choosy about their clothing purchases.
Banana Republic was no stranger to the retail market's ups and downs. In the first quarter of the pandemic, the company's net sales dropped 47 percent. When Ms. Stangl took the top role, in December 2020, Banana Republic's design team started making attire that was both versatile and comfortable. When it was time to head back to the office, shoppers turned to the store for relaxed yet professional attire. In the first quarter of 2022, net sales rose 24 percent.
But after three years of hybrid work, many people were shopping for work clothes less frequently and had stopped viewing the clothes they wore to work as distinct from the rest of their wardrobe. In the first quarter of this year, Banana Republic's net sales fell 10 percent.
Even before the pandemic, Banana Republic faced falling sales and struggled to attract customers without a 40 percent markdown. As it lost customers, it began closing stores, going from 566 in 2019 to just over 400 in January 2023. The same month, Banana Republic said it would shutter its two-story flagship in San Francisco, where its corporate offices still are. It will soon open a smaller flagship location, which will sell home products and a new art collection, available now. The retailer also started selling athletic wear and clothes for babies and toddlers.
Banana Republic's push to sell goods beyond clothes isn't new. It follows a familiar playbook from other companies that have sought to cast themselves as "lifestyle brands" to inspire shoppers to buy into all manner of products from them.
Banana Republic is looking for a "long-term strategy of building brand relevance," Corey Tarlowe, a retail analyst at Jefferies, said.
"Banana Republic is not one of those companies that you think of that are doing amazing," he added. "There's been so many problems for this Banana Republic business over the last 10 years. They're trying to see these opportunities and figure out what works."
The problems are even more acute because its parent company, Gap Inc., is in flux. In April, Gap said it was laying off 1,800 workers, or about 9 percent of its work force, to save $ 300 million. A month later, the company said sales at all of its brands, which also include Old Navy and Athleta, had declined in the most recent quarter. Gap's stock has decreased 16 percent since the start of the year, and the retailer has been without a permanent chief executive for a year.
Changing the perception of a store among shoppers is not easy. Marcela Diaz swung by one of Banana Republic's San Francisco stores on a recent Wednesday afternoon to check out some clothes, holding a bag from Zara that contained a pair of silk pants.
Ms. Diaz, a self-described casual dresser, said that coming out of the pandemic, Banana Republic came to mind when she was looking for apparel appropriate for professional meetings.
"As I've gone back to work, I've been shopping more with Banana Republic online," said Ms. Diaz, who works at a nonprofit in Santa Fe, N.M., and left the store without making a purchase.
While some shoppers and even Ms. Stangl see the term "work wear" as passé, Banana Republic still has a dedicated section on its website called "The Workwear Edit."
Angela Branch, a 39-year-old working at a university in Chicago, was also drawn to Banana Republic's online store. She said she had always thought of its clothes as "business business" but bought a lightweight cashmere sweater and utility pants because they worked well for both the office and weekend brunch.
Before the pandemic, she used to have a section in her closet dedicated to work wear, and she frequently added to it. But now her clothes need to be more versatile, she said, and concerns about the economy have curbed her spending even more.
"I've definitely slowed up a lot because I don't really need anything," Ms. Branch said.
But Banana Republic's nascent home décor line, she said, could make her want to keep spending there.
Eric Ford, a 30-year-old working in marketing in New York, echoed that sentiment. His mother introduced him to Banana Republic when he was younger, but until recently, the brand had felt irrelevant to him. The push to sell décor and furniture comes at a time in his life and career when he's ready to put money toward those kinds of purchases.
"I literally told myself 30 is the time where, like, all my money is going to my closet, my home and me traveling," Mr. Ford, who lives in Brooklyn, said.
Analysts are still skeptical that Banana Republic's home goods strategy will find widespread success. The company is up against the more established businesses of Ralph Lauren, H&M, Zara and Restoration Hardware. (Ms. Stangl, Banana Republic's chief executive, was once the chief merchant at Restoration Hardware.)
"You're not going to be Restoration Hardware by any means," said Liza Amlani, the founder of Retail Strategy Group, a consulting firm. "Banana has a lot of competition, and they should just really scrap that whole idea" and remain focused on clothing, she added.
Aaron Rose, Banana Republic's chief commerce and experience officer, said there was room for the retailer to succeed, noting that no company has more than 5 percent of the home market and that "there's plenty of opportunity for everybody."
And if the home business proves to be a success, Banana Republic has other ideas.
"Do we see ourselves going into hospitality? Sure. And restaurants? I think there's a place for that," Ms. Stangl said. "We're dreaming about what travel means to us and to our brand. There's something there, right?"

SAN FRANCISCO — Inside Banana Republic’s design studio in San Francisco, Sandra Stangl, the company’s chief executive, pointed to an item that had been creating buzz in stores.
It was not a shirt or dress draped on a mannequin. Instead, Stangl walked toward a king-size bed with a parchment-colored backboard. The company has started putting these bed frames, which sell for around $5,000, near the front of its stores in Los Angeles and New York. Enough shoppers have asked if they were for sale — the answer: Not yet, but Stangl and her team are taking a limited number of pre-orders for the fall.
Shoppers usually think about outfitting themselves, not their homes, when they walk into Banana Republic. But the brand is trying to change that. In March, the retailer announced it would begin selling home textiles, and since then it has rolled out items like throw blankets, rugs and the attention-grabbing bed frames, selling home products online and in 16 of its stores.
The home category “gives us a bigger addressable audience,” Stangl said, standing in front of an embroidered linen and cotton duvet, which the company says is a best seller. She added that offering home goods “stabilizes out the business a little bit.”
Throughout the pandemic, the shopping environment for apparel retailers took on a boom-bust pattern. Shoppers stuck at home were first buying yoga pants, then sought work-appropriate clothes when a full-scale return to the office seemed imminent. Now, as many people’s day-to-day lives have settled into more of a hybrid situation, consumers are being even more choosy about their clothing purchases.
Banana Republic was no stranger to the retail market’s ups and downs. In the first quarter of the pandemic, the company’s net sales dropped 47%. When Stangl took the top role, in December 2020, Banana Republic’s design team started making attire that was both versatile and comfortable. When it was time to head back to the office, shoppers turned to the store for relaxed yet professional attire. In the first quarter of 2022, net sales rose 24%.
But after three years of hybrid work, many people were shopping for work clothes less frequently and had stopped viewing the clothes they wore to work as distinct from the rest of their wardrobe. In the first quarter of this year, Banana Republic’s net sales fell 10%.
Even before the pandemic, Banana Republic faced falling sales and struggled to attract customers without a 40% markdown. As it lost customers, it began closing stores, going from 566 in 2019 to just over 400 in January 2023. The same month, Banana Republic said it would shutter its two-story flagship in San Francisco, where its corporate offices still are. It will soon open a smaller flagship location, which will sell home products and a new art collection, available now. The retailer also started selling athletic wear and clothes for babies and toddlers.
Banana Republic’s push to sell goods beyond clothes isn’t new. It follows a familiar playbook from other companies that have sought to cast themselves as “lifestyle brands” to inspire shoppers to buy into all manner of products from them.
Banana Republic is looking for a “long-term strategy of building brand relevance,” said Corey Tarlowe, a retail analyst at Jefferies.
“Banana Republic is not one of those companies that you think of that are doing amazing,” he added. “There’s been so many problems for this Banana Republic business over the last 10 years. They’re trying to see these opportunities and figure out what works.”

Away From Ibiza, in a Place That Welcomes Bare Feet: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Forget Ibiza. A hip new hotel opening underscores how many in the style set opt for the charms of Majorca instead.
The Serra de Tramuntana is a mountain range that runs along the northwestern edge of the island of Majorca, off the coast of mainland Spain. Its towering peaks and valleys are lined with ancient olive groves, lemon orchards and picturesque hilltop villages. The winding pathways that dot the rugged cliffs plunge through pine trees and goat herds to meet the Mediterranean Sea.
Nine years ago, the British fashion photographer Kate Bellm decided to make these mountains her home, building a house just off the coastal road between the towns of Deia and Soller and commuting to shoots for clients like Gucci and magazines like British Vogue. In 2020, after she fell in love with the 18th-century finca next door, she and her husband, the Mexican artist Edgar Lopez Arellano, decided to turn their hands to hospitality.
Hotel Corazon opened earlier this month, after more than two years of work by the couple alongside a team from Moredesign, a local architecture practice that's a mainstay of glossy magazines like Architectural Digest.
"We were covered in dust for months and months," Ms. Bellm, 35, said as she made her way from a cavernous room with a fireplace centerpiece -- perfect for snuggle puddles or sound baths, she declared -- and into a verdant inner courtyard. The hotel's aesthetic, and particularly its bedrooms, feels heavily influenced by the organic architecture movement of the 1970s, which espoused carving out a harmonious balance between the synthetic and natural worlds.
All of the rooms are individually designed but share curving pigmented lime walls in soft shades of pink, sage and ocher; custom-made furniture by local artisans; shaggy carpets; and windows that open out onto gardens overflowing with palm and jacaranda trees, honeysuckle and cactuses (Mr. Arellano, 40, who specializes in constructing zero-water cactus gardens, was busy potting several varieties on the restaurant terrace nearby.) Rooms range from 550 euros (about $ 600) to 1,800 euros.
"When I came here for the first time, I knew immediately what we needed to do and what it had the capacity to give," said Ms. Bellm, who wore stonewashed denim flares and braids in her mane of hair. "A place this island is missing -- a supercool hotel that feels like the private home of a friend, with wellness at its core and where you can't break the rules because there are none. I wanted to create a place that my people -- fashion people -- will totally love."
Earlier this month the supermodel Anja Rubik, who owns a house on Majorca, booked Hotel Corazon to celebrate her 40th birthday. Alexandre de Betak, who produces runway shows, and Mario Sorrenti, the fashion photographer, also own holiday houses close by.
But don't most of the fashion "it" crowd descend on Ibiza during the summer? Ms. Bellm wrinkled her nose.
"I feel like the big dogs come here," she said. "Obviously Ibiza is great to pop in, but it's just a different scene, shall we say. I feel like Majorca is very unpretentious. You can just be in your pajamas all day basically, especially here at Corazon. This is a hotel for those who want to be barefoot, eat straight from the trees, swim in the sea at night and get lost in the pines."
Concierge services will be via WhatsApp for guests wanting to know the best hidden swimming coves and caves for summer, or hiking trails to waterfalls and meadows full of wild mountain flowers during the cooler seasons. Adventure fuel can be found in the hotel's homemade date shakes or matcha smoothies, and restoration in its yoga, sound healing, massage and reiki sessions.
The menu is designed to be "local, seasonal, medicinal and delicious," Ms. Bellm said, with most of the produce grown in Hotel Corazon's newly planted organic farm with 50 garden beds. There is also an artist residency program underway, with painters, sculptors and ceramists chosen by Ms. Bellm to stay and create work at the hotel, with a final exhibition in Corazon's gallery at the end of their time there.
"I love collaborating with artists and to see how they make things -- it gives you inspirations to do things differently in your own world" said Ms. Bellm, whose main client is currently Zara and who added that she was shooting more and more work at the hotel and on the island. "Plus, we can also help them tap into the creative community that exists here in Majorca, who can fix their vintage cameras or fire their pots. I want people to be able to thrive on this place like I have."
After forging her professional reputation on super-sexy depictions of, in her words, "rock 'n' roll babes," Ms. Bellm said that her muses now were "the wild mothers of Majorca who live near me and take their babies in the rocks and, like, swim naked with starfish in their hands. They are so badass." Ms. Bellm's son, Sage, was born on the island.
It is little surprise that one of her favorite pastimes at the hotel is topless gardening with neighbors.
"We should totally also do a sound bath down here, it really floats you into another realm" she said excitedly as she walked through the farm and chomped into a ripened peach. "The more I think about it, the more I just want to be around the veggies and have them experience the gong too."

On Monday night, luminaries of music and film, dressed in ruffles, sequins and tulle, gathered in Harlem at the Apollo Theater and in SoHo for a Tribeca Film Festival dinner.
Uptown, the Apollo hosted its annual Spring Benefit, where musicians and philanthropists celebrated the theater's 90th year and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Sean Combs accepted awards. The event included performances by Wyclef Jean; Stout; Gladys Knight, and MC Lyte, who were supported by Ray Chew, the music director for the event, and his band.
Later, guests were transported by bus to the after-party about a block away where they danced to sets by Derrick Jones, known as "D-Nice," and DJ Kool. The event raised more than $ 2.2 million for the organization.
Downtown, on Spring Street, Chanel hosted the 16th annual Tribeca Festival Artists dinner at Balthazar, which honored women artists who contributed original artwork to the festival's filmmakers. The crowd included Robert De Niro, Lizzy Caplan, Tracee Ellis Ross, Brendan Fraser, Katie Holmes and Sofia Coppola. Guests dined on steak frites while flipping through art books, which were placed at each seat.
Below, see some of the looks that did the most at each event.
Apollo Theater's Spring Benefit
'I wanted to be really comfortable, so I'm wearing jeans. This is very on-brand for me.' -- Joelle Joseph Sayed
'To be Black is to be bold. And beautiful. And big. So this was very big. It represents our culture.' -- Makaela Reed
'The Apollo has radiated so much color into our world. They have given the cultural sector -- the culture of America that we know today -- so much color, so much jazz, so much pizazz, that I wanted to radiate out that in what I was wearing.' -- Jonathan McCrory
'I'm a Caribbean man, so I always mix up styles. And I think I get my style from more like my grandfather. I love fedoras. I love to mix fashion designers, those that you might know and those you might not know.' -- Wyclef Jean
Tribeca Festival Artists Dinner
'I was going for classy as usual.' -- Tommy Dorfman
'I'm feeling Halloween meets 1920s. But most of all, I feel very chic.' -- Zazie Beetz
The Most Dressed features great outfits from up, down and all around town.

Full text: Jeremy O. Harris celebrated art stars, while Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union showed up for Loewe.
Los Angeles is so consumed with celebrity that even some houses are famous. Take the Sheats-Goldstein residence, a co-star in films like "The Big Lebowski." Last Friday the e-commerce site Mytheresa leveraged its renown to fete the new Paula's Ibiza collection from Loewe, a beachy capsule the brand has released each summer since 2017. "This is the playful part of the brand," said Tiffany Hsu, Mytheresa's vice president for buying.
On the other coast, MoMA PS1 hosted its annual gala in the museum's front courtyard. Guests mingled over drinks and music by BombaYo, followed by a seated dinner punctuated with speeches by the evening's honorees: Robert Soros, a member of the museum's board of trustees, and the artists James Turrell, Daniel Lind-Ramos and Anicka Yi. A performance by the singer duendita signaled it was time for the after-party and for guests, including Solange Knowles, to dance into the early hours of the morning.
MoMA PS1 Annual Gala
'I wanted something that blurred the gender lines, and something that felt very free, flowy and that reflected my identity as an artist.' -- Jeffrey Meris
'I decided to wear this because it makes me feel very feminine and liberated, and it's my armor. I'm really a wallflower, but the armor that I put on makes me feel confident to move throughout spaces.' -- Friday Lynton
'I think a lot about being outdoors. I work on the High Line, so I spend a lot of time outdoors. I try to mimic nature.' -- Cecilia Alemani
'I just got rid of a lot of stuff, so I'm just really down to the things that I really feel good about wearing. Outfits have been coming together seamlessly.' -- Kalifa Diouf
'I feel like artists paint because they are telling a story. When I put on clothes, it's me telling a story to the world.' -- Matthew Kovalsky
Loewe Mytheresa
"I always tell Jennifer [Coolidge] that Jonathan Anderson is the Mike White of fashion. Like, he sees the bigger picture. He understands the greater vision and understands how to use this to tell the stories of our time." -- Evan Ross Katz
'Knowing Jonathan [Anderson], and how he respects the creative process, the clothing really is a manifestation of his hopes and dreams." -- Dan Levy

Jessie Ware Saves Your Recommendations: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The British singer and songwriter's fifth album, "That! Feels Good!," adds a soulful spin to her recent dance-floor music. Her offstage life is fueled by eggs, Lisa Vanderpump and musical theater.
Onstage at Webster Hall in New York last fall, Jessie Ware glided through choreography in a faux-fur-trimmed turquoise caftan, and later swung a black whip while singing the title track from her 2020 disco LP, "What's Your Pleasure?" Backstage, however, was a different vibe.
"I had a bat mitzvah lesson in my dressing room," the British singer and songwriter, 38, said in an interview last month. "That's when your worlds are colliding."
Ware has become an expert at hilariously exposing the gap between the luxuriousness of her music and the realities of life as a touring musician, a mother of three young children, a cookbook author and a successful podcaster ("Table Manners," co-hosted by her mother, Lennie, is in its 15th season).
"What's Your Pleasure?," an album designed for escape, gave her music career a jolt. Her fifth LP -- "That! Feels Good!," out Friday -- is a sequel of sorts, but the earlier album's synth thump is joined by a new dimension: soulful, brassy warmth, often thanks to Kokoroko, an eight-piece band. "I've always longed to make soul music," Ware said. "I've done bits and bobs of it, but this felt very focused and authentic."
Scrolling through a list of cultural influences on her phone in the bar of a New York hotel, Ware debated what to include. "You think Fran Lebowitz would be my friend if I put her in the Top 10?" she asked, before deciding, "She wouldn't want to be my friend because I'm on my phone too much." These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Photo Booths
I'm constantly trying to make my phone take pictures that look old and romantic, and the photo booth just does that. And also the fact that you can't change it -- I like that, and that they're these four pictures that can take you back to a nostalgic moment. My husband did a photography degree but he's [expletive] at taking photos of me: terrible angles, manages to always take them when my eyes are half open. What I've just started doing is taking selfies of myself, but pretending that I'm being caught off guard so that I can get really good photos with my children.
'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'
It's dirty and naughty and I probably should be doing something else, but I'm there, invested in the Kathy and Kyle drama. And I love it. It centers me. And my husband walks in and he's like, What are you watching? And I'm like, Don't judge me, these are really important women that are telling very important stories and they're very entertaining. I love Mauricio. I live for the moments when he's stoned. Dorit has really grown on me, I think she's got real wit. I really miss Lisa Vanderpump. I loved her.
Eggs
Because they're versatile. Because you can have them at any meal. Because I wrote a book called "Omelet." They solve a lot of problems. I feel at home with an egg anywhere. I said this in my book, but if there was a crisis, my mum would be like, "Do you want an omelet, darling?" So it became like this thing where like my brother was like, I don't want a [expletive] omelet.
My Saved Places on Google Maps
I hate missing out on good food in a new place. It's kind of slightly stressful. When we were on holiday for our honeymoon, I wasn't a bridezilla, I was a honeymoonzilla. But I didn't have the Google Maps saved lists that could have made my life easier. So when I'm on tour, I save places that people recommend. It's so good for being able to work out your route for the day, like, I'm going to go to this coffee shop, then I'm going to go to the famous cemetery in Buenos Aires, and then I'm going to walk from there.
Matinees
Jamie Lee Curtis said that whole thing about like, Why doesn't Coldplay do a matinee? I completely agree with her. Apparently Little Mix have always been doing matinees. Much respect to them. The idea of going onstage at 9 p.m. sometimes fills me with total dread, when I'm usually in my pajamas watching "Real Housewives" or something. Can you call a lunch a matinee? Anything that's, like, in the day. Then you have time to digest it, understand it, enjoy it. But also time for that eight hours sleep.
Handwritten Letters
I don't do it enough, but I appreciate them so much. And handwritten cards. Emails, I'm over it, I know that that's how we function. Text messages, I get it. But there's nothing more thoughtful than a handwritten letter. I think I read that Reese Witherspoon did this, but I write my children a letter every year. They've all got their own book, and I write them a letter, mainly so I can remember what they did in the year. Because I know that when they get to like, 21, then they're going to ask me and I'll be like, I don't know what your first word was.
Musicals
It's kind of where I began singing. It's something that's really inspired how I make music -- that idea of escapism and the idea of melodrama combined with emotion. I like that fantasy aspect of it, that it can kind of elevate. If you say you hate musical theater, I'm going to question our friendship, because I don't believe that you've gone to see good enough musical theater.
'The Traitors'
I'm talking about the first season of the British series. If anybody played the game at university called Mafia, where you have to say who the killer is and they have to kill other people whilst you're like, staring? The premise is that, and we would all be very rich if whilst we were getting stoned at uni, we thought that could be a great format for television.
Foreign Pharmacies
There was a time when you could get Valium in India when I was in my 20s. That was a fantastic time. But also for the products, particularly in the French pharmacies, the beauty products. I mean, you can now get Bioderma everywhere now, but there was a time where everybody would come back from Fashion Week with loads of Bioderma. I love perusing the aisles of a foreign pharmacy and getting any kind of insect repellent, sunglasses, chewing gum.
Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge, or the Knockoff
I got it for my husband for Christmas, but I wear it. It's obscenely expensive. One day my beautician came 'round to give me a wax, and I said, "You smell really good!" She went, "Oh babe, I got it in Zara." I was like, You're kidding me. Zara has done a knockoff, so you don't need to spend the bloody amount of money that I did. It smelled exactly the same.

The Education Divide Can Be Bridged: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was probably the most nerve-racking job interview of my life.
Across the table from me sat a person who had it all: years of professional experience, confidence and, perhaps most impressively from my vantage point, undergraduate and graduate degrees from two of the top journalism schools in the country. Here I was with a 10th-grade education and a G.E.D., hoping to impress a possible future colleague in an industry that expects impressive credentials.
It's normal to be anxious in a job interview, so in a sense my desire for approval that day was not out of the ordinary. Except I wasn't interviewing for the job. I was the interviewer. More specifically, I was a newly promoted digital editor at a major business magazine looking to hire my first staff writer.
I've never forgotten this dynamic: being in a managerial role in the New York City media industry -- top of my game, as they say -- and somehow still worrying that a job candidate might look up my educational background and wonder what right I had to be where I am.
That's the real power of education.
When we talk about the education divide in this country, it's often through the lens of political and cultural differences. College-educated Americans are assumed to be more progressive, vote Democratic, live in cities and work in professions that before the pandemic required being in an office. Their non-degreed counterparts, the story goes, tend to be more conservative, rural and employed in the kinds of blue-collar jobs that have been disappearing for the last 40 years.
Academic studies and polling data back up these stereotypes to some extent, but they are only one piece of a bigger picture of the giant rifts that have formed and continue to form between Americans who benefit from higher education and those who don't.
The education divide is equally about who gives us a chance, who lets us in the room and which rooms we get to be in. It's what made my encounter as a non-degreed editor interviewing a job candidate with a master's from a top journalism school feel so poignant. Had our roles in the interview been reversed that day, it's hard to imagine that my résumé would even have been considered.
Even after 17 years as a working journalist, I can't take being in the room for granted. Job hunting in the white-collar world can be an especially demoralizing exercise when you have no formal education. I still recall a personal low point in the summer of 2016, when I was swept up in a large round of layoffs -- not unlike the kind we've been hearing so much about recently. I was 45, newly married and suddenly severed from the online news publication where I'd worked as a reporter and editor. I felt good about my prospects, but despite having a decade of full-time newsroom experience under my belt, I couldn't win the precious attention of hiring managers in media.
In fact, I couldn't even get my résumé in front of them. Without a bachelor's degree -- long considered the de facto minimum qualification for a career in journalism -- my online job applications were likely being swallowed up by algorithmic forces beyond my control, lost to the void of hiring software that was built to weed out the undesirable. Thanks to résumé screening, my years of experience no longer counted for me as much as my lack of schooling counted against me.
This was an era when software start-ups like Lever and Greenhouse were attracting big investors with the promise of building next-generation platforms for recruitment and hiring. In my 2016 search, finding a job seemed to be all about pointing and clicking, filling out fields, pressing send and hoping for the best. Technology had removed key frictions from the application process, necessitating a new kind of automated gate keeping. Employers, like romance seekers on dating websites, assumed they knew exactly what they were looking for. Your chances of getting through the filters were wholly dependent on having a long list of predetermined attributes.
And for journalism, those attributes included a college-level education. I quickly learned during my discouraging job search that summer how easy it is to get ensnared by an applicant tracking system when your schooling stops at a G.E.D. or when you have gaps in your job history because of struggles with addiction or when you spent your 20s working in retail. With nuance, I could perhaps explain my unusual back story to a human being, but how do you reason with a portal?
The good news is, future job searches may not always be as bleak as mine have been. Companies from Google to G.M. to Delta Air Lines are dropping college degree requirements for many roles, focusing instead on skills-based hiring, a philosophy that emphasizes people over pedigrees. Some high-profile chief executives, including Ryan Roslansky of LinkedIn, have been vocal about the benefits of a skills-based approach for companies looking to broaden their talent pipelines. And the Business Roundtable introduced its Multiple Pathways Initiative with the goal of improving diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of corporate America by emphasizing "the value of skills" in recruitment, retention and advancement. This movement is not new, but the tight labor market, along with some of the inequities that were made more apparent by the pandemic, has brought it to the fore.
Having spent so many years in a profession where college is the default starting point, I suspect that it will take more than a few adjustments to H.R. software filters to produce meaningful change. Consider the ever-persistent education wage gap, which has been widening for decades and by some measures got even worse during the past few years. Recently updated data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated that the median annual wage for younger workers with a bachelor's degree was $ 52,000 in 2022, compared with $ 34,320 for high school graduates in the same age group. Meanwhile, wage gaps along racial and gender lines persist at all education levels, as evidenced by a 2021 report from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Education can be a reasonably reliable predictor of lifetime earnings, the report found, but it's only one part of a "complex equation."
It's probably also worth pointing out that most studies you'll read about the education divide are written by people on one side of it. The same holds true for most news articles. Can we be so surprised that the media presents an incomplete picture of higher education when so few journalists navigate the working world without a four-year degree?
Assumptions around higher education just need to evolve. I still remember the boss at a weekly newspaper where I once worked who told me to toss résumés in the garbage if they didn't have a college listed on them. Changing hearts and minds is hard, but changing habits is harder. One 2022 survey conducted by Morning Consult found that even though 72 percent of employers said they didn't believe a college degree was a great indicator of a person's skills, more than half still hired candidates from degree programs anyway because they saw doing so as a "less risky choice."
Even I understand why they feel that way. When I was interviewing candidates for that staff writer position, I can't recall a single résumé that didn't include a four-year degree. Most of the people I end up working with in journalism are college graduates, many of whom rightly saw college as their ticket to a better life. And most of them are talented, driven and more than qualified.
Higher education is always going to be a great way to secure professional opportunities and ensure the chance for upward mobility. Maybe it's even the best way. But need it be the only way?

Your $12.74 Shirt Was Made Possible by Poverty: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Fashion, it turns out, is the true opiate of the masses. Across the country, while inflation has siphoned middle-class wealth, American consumers have enjoyed a consolation prize: Apparel is dirt cheap. In 1993, you could buy a T-shirt for $ 13 -- and get a midsize tank full of gas for about the same. Today, the full tank would cost more than three times as much. That T-shirt? $ 12.74.
We know the human cost of this benefit. One sweltering day in Bangladesh 10 years ago, workers at the Rana Plaza garment factory complex raised alarms about cracks in the building. They were threatened with the loss of a month's pay if they stayed home. The building collapsed the next day, killing 1,134 people and injuring over 2,500.
A subsequent, legally binding accord between trade unions and (still too few) brands improved building safety in Bangladesh. And yet, while that one problem was addressed, today even less attention is being paid to the welfare of the people who work across the industry. Over the last decade, the voices of the over 75 million vulnerable workers in the global garment and textile industry have been, like the products they made, steadily devalued.
It wasn't always this way. From the Industrial Revolution until the end of the Cold War, the apparel industry was the world's most important engine of human development. In mid-19th century Manchester, the textile trade fostered technological leaps that led to higher wages and lower prices for consumer goods.
By the turn of the century, Eastern European Jews and other immigrants built the Lower East Side's garment district into not only a wealth generator but also the vanguard of a national workers' rights movement. In the 1960s, the Korean apparel industry anchored the postwar recovery and then expanded to other Asian countries. Following Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, China's apparel industry helped spark economic growth that contributed to one of the largest exoduses of humanity from absolute poverty. Apparel has served as an escape from subsistence farm work for billions of people.
Today, that engine has stalled in first gear. The average garment worker earns barely half the pay needed to reach a decent standard of living. The monthly minimum wage for a Bangladeshi garment worker is equivalent to $ 75, meaning a worker can make less than $ 3 a day. Many are unable to afford staples like meat.
The easy scapegoat for the miserable working conditions many apparel workers labor in is fast fashion, a business model popularized by the likes of the Zara founder Amancio Ortega (No. 14 on Forbes's billionaires list), which chases hit runway trends with rapid production. But such companies -- like Shein, with its staggeringly low prices and opaque supply chains -- are symptoms, not the cause.
One aggravator is the current purchasing habits of millennials. The first modern American generation to hit their 30s in worse economic shape than their parents, millennials came of age during the Great Recession slammed by student debt. Inflation has pushed housing, energy, food -- all the essentials of life -- further beyond the grasp of many. As a result, many younger Americans aren't yet putting their wallets where their values are.
That downward pressure, combined with diminished labor power, means that the $ 1.5 trillion apparel industry has fallen to a place of widespread abuse that would not have looked out of place in the early years of industrialization. In 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforcing a legislative mandate to prevent goods made with forced labor from entering U.S. markets, stopped $ 816.5 million worth of products -- up from $ 55 million in 2020 -- including garments. Transparentem, the nonprofit investigative group that I founded, has exposed numerous abuses in the supply chains of dozens of companies -- including forced labor, child labor and highly polluted working environments.
Across Malaysia and other garment-producing countries we investigated, workers described being held hostage in the same trap: debt bondage after paying exorbitant recruitment fees to unscrupulous recruiters.
The apparel industry suffers from what economists call an "agency problem." Brands rely on auditors to uncover violations in factories -- then often require the factories to pay for their own audits. Unsurprisingly, the typical audit is short, untrustworthy and, as Transparentem found at most audited factories we investigated, easily gamed. Suppliers, already operating on razor-thin margins, cannot afford to lose customers. Nor can the auditors, who often show little interest in scrutinizing their clients to the point of discomfort.
Younger consumers, who tend to be progressive and skeptical of received wisdom, offer the world's best hope for change. They are concerned about moral consumption, seeing it as a question of self-identity. In 2015, 73 percent of global millennials said they would pay more for sustainable products. That figure may grow even larger as millennial incomes continue to rise. Millions of users of sites like Poshmark and Depop -- websites that specialize in helping people buy and sell used clothing -- are millennials and Gen Z-ers, many of whom are looking for a way to avoid primary fast fashion consumption entirely.
Many young consumers are also obsessed with truth, and they aren't buying some brands' superficial "greenwashing" or flimsy claims of ethical production. Nor should they. To date, precious few companies -- Patagonia is a rare exception-- even attempt to be sufficiently transparent about true working conditions in their supply chains. Although young consumers would pay more for sustainable products, brands lack the transparency needed to close the deal.
This presents an opportunity. We know young consumers are willing to pay more for clothing made by workers whose voices can be heard. And we all need to know that those workers are OK. A first, urgent step: Apparel companies should publish full, detailed social compliance audits, which purport to evaluate working conditions, at all upstream factories. Such disclosure would allow investors, other brands, consumers, activists, unions and, critically, the workers themselves, to audit the auditors and, progressively, be a part of more inclusive monitoring.
A second step: All apparel and footwear companies should sign the Commitment to Responsible Recruitment. Its signatories vow to ensure that no workers at their suppliers should pay a broker for their jobs (a setup that often leads to forced labor), and to ensure that all workers are allowed to hold on to their travel documents and to retain their freedom of movement. It also says that migrant workers should be informed, in their own languages, of the true terms of employment before they leave their home country.
True transparency may mean that companies need to invest more to listen, and respond, to the people who make their clothes. For consumers, that T-shirt might cost them more than $ 12.74. But for millions of workers whose freedom and safety are every day held hostage, the cost of laboring in darkness is already too high.

Full text: A COUPLE of months after I started college, I flew to Mexico City to spend a weekend with my dad. He had promised me that if I studied Spanish during high school, I could join him on a business trip abroad. There's a photo of us from that weekend at the base of the Teotihuacan pyramids; it's one of the first pictures in which we're the same height. I'm wearing a wool peacoat that I had just bought from Zara. The coat was too heavy for the weather, but I thought it made me look like an adult. A few days after returning from the trip, my dad called me to tell me he had been fired. It was the height of the 2008 recession, and the unemployment rate was climbing. The peacoat hanging on my dorm room door suddenly seemed like a ridiculous extravagance. So did the loans I had taken out to study creative writing. I transferred to Northwestern University, close enough to home that I could commute to school and save money. I didn't drink or go to parties; I studied and worked. I got a less risky degree in journalism and folded clothes after class at American Apparel. When graduation rolled around, I decided to stay home rather than pay $ 80 to rent a cap and gown. I know I was lucky to go to college. And I owe the life I have now to my diligence during those years. But I still feel jealous when friends reminisce about college experiences I thought I couldn't afford, like studying abroad and taking classes in Russian literature. And there are nights when I wonder whether I could have hacked it as a fiction writer if I hadn't been so shaken by the recession. I'm not the only one with mixed feelings about their undergraduate years. More than a thousand people wrote in after Times Opinion asked readers to share their college regrets. Some put too much stock in college rankings, applying to top schools rather than ones that matched their personalities. Others felt they went to college before they were ready. And many, many readers regretted taking on enormous student loans that weighed them down for decades after graduating. Below, we've published interviews with eight of the readers who shared their stories. As part of Times Opinion's close look at the college selection process, we're also inaugurating a tool that we hope will help students avoid college regret. The tool encourages them to reflect on their interests and desires. Then it generates college rankings that better fit those priorities. I hope that high schoolers find the tool and the following interviews helpful. There is hard-earned wisdom in the hindsight of the graduates who shared their stories. Most of all, I hope that today's high school seniors don't brood over dream schools that they didn't get into and that unhappy graduates don't let life become an elegy to what ifs, as I admit I sometimes do. College is just one of many forks in the road. There's a lot more life after you graduate.
Hannah Pfeiffer A lawyer who attended St. Michael's College from 2006 to 2010. I was really eager to go to college, and I knew I wanted to leave Rhode Island. I had traditional ideas about what college is supposed to look like: brick buildings and a quad. That led me to look at small liberal arts colleges in New England. St. Michael's in Vermont felt like the right financial decision. My scholarship covered three-quarters of tuition. But an academic scholarship carries you only so far. I had to pay for room and board and books and study abroad. I graduated with about $ 60,000 in student loan debt. I was a history major, and my first job after graduating was a volunteer job with a nonprofit. In order to pay my half of rent, I also worked in a bakery making seven dollars an hour. I still have student loans. Sixty thousand dollars over four years sounded affordable. I wasn't thinking about interest accruing because I couldn't pay that debt off the day I graduated. I could have gone to a state university and graduated earlier and spent a lot less money. Don't be drawn into a romantic vision of college.
Alison Farmer A high school teacher who attended the University of Chicago from 1997 to 2001. My dad was a welder, and my mom was an administrative clerk. I was a first-generation college student. I didn't have a whole lot of guidance when it came to college, and my applications were mostly limited to schools in Ohio. Then I visited the guy who I was dating at the University of Chicago and fell in love with the school's culture of celebrating nerds. I got a scholarship at the University of Chicago and still graduated with $ 80,000 in student loan debt. For a public-school teacher, the pay starts pretty low. There were nights when I was in tears. I was on the phone with Citibank more than once asking what my options were. I turned down graduate school opportunities because I didn't want to take on more debt. Don't get caught up in thinking that only one place can offer what you're looking for. You can get a great education at almost any school. If I had gone to Miami University or Kenyon College or Wright State, I could have had just as transformational of an experience and not have been paying off college loans into my 40s. Benjamin Boniece A postdoctoral researcher who attended Skidmore College from 2007 to 2011. When I was applying to college, there was a news article about the best colleges that were outside the Ivy League. Skidmore was one of the "new Ivies" in the article. I liked Skidmore when I visited. It seemed to be strong academically, and it was a small school, which I thought would be uniformly better than a large school. It wasn't until I went to graduate school and worked at several universities that I realized Skidmore had left me severely underprepared. I still feel like I'm catching up. There were some pretty big holes in my mathematics major. People I know who studied math at other schools took twice as many courses as I took in mathematics, because I was filling my credits with liberal arts classes. When I was 17, I thought well-roundedness was really attainable only at a small liberal arts school. If I could go back in time, I would have gone to a medium or larger school and tried to make the well-rounded thing happen on my own. Sarah Mickelson A script coordinator who attended Seattle University from 2010 to 2012 and the University of Southern California from 2012 to 2014. I went to an extremely rigorous high school and applied to 17 colleges. If you didn't apply to that many schools, it was weird. My dream school was the University of Washington. I got in, and when I visited, I was hit with a feeling that I belonged there. When I told my mom that, she was really unhappy. She thought that a state school like the University of Washington, with larger class sizes, would not offer a good enough education. She put all of my belongings in trash bags and told me she wouldn't help me pay for college unless I went to Seattle University, which was smaller. Ultimately, I went to the school my mom wanted me to go to, and I was really unhappy. I tried to make it work, but by the second year, I decided to transfer. To this day, I hear people reminisce about college, and I get so envious because I feel like that was taken from me. Don't be intimidated or influenced by other people's choices or opinions. Sure, 18-year-olds are naïve. But at the same time, you have to make your own mistakes. Robbie Preece A writer and operations manager who attended Brigham Young University from 2002 to 2008. I chose Brigham Young University because I was born and raised a Mormon. I was excited to be surrounded by 30,000 kids who had the same goals and moral and religious background as me. There was no need to explain who you were. During college, I started working at a ski resort and getting exposed to people outside the faith and people of color. My brother came out of the closet about two years after my senior year. When I was at Brigham Young, I was steeped in a culture where it was OK to call someone gay as an insult. If I could go back, I would gently tell myself what I know now about the church's history of racism and its treatment of L.G.B.T.Q. people. I wish I had listened to the doubts that I had about the faith. It probably would have been OK to go to the University of Utah, where there was a bigger community of people from different backgrounds. Irene Kern A bartender and bar manager who attended the University of Colorado, Boulder, from 2006 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2010. I'm from Hawaii, and I wanted to get off the island so badly. Boulder was the farthest east I was willing to go, and I had family there. When I visited the campus, it felt like what a college campus should be. Being half Chinese and passing as white, I found Boulder a really weird experience. I would go to parties and be around a bunch of drunk white kids -- not that there's anything wrong with that -- and people would say some really messed-up, racist things to me, thinking that I was one of them. I also went into my freshman year closeted, and I experienced lots of homophobia while I was trying to be straight. It wasn't until I moved to San Francisco that I found my people -- people who didn't care what I majored in. And when I started bartending, I was making a lot more money than I would have with a bachelor's degree in sociology. In spite of what everybody else is doing and what all the adults in your life tell you, college is not that important. It's not essential in terms of learning who you are and accepting yourself. Jon Russell A software developer who attended Virginia Tech from 2003 to 2008. When I was in high school, I knew I wanted to study computer science more than anything. Virginia Tech had the best computer science program in the state. My decision to go there came down to the school's ranking and talking with family members who went there and said the engineering program was strong. I thought college would be a breeding ground of interesting political ideas and communities. But Virginia Tech was a politically dead school. All my friends wanted to talk about was beer, Jesus, the military and football. And I was a Buddhist. If I had been open to nonengineering schools, I might have gone to a different school and had a much better time. You don't need to go to the best engineering school to have a career in engineering. Camaren Ly A lieutenant in the U.S. Space Force who attended the Air Force Academy from 2016 to 2020. During my first year at the Air Force Academy, I wondered if I made the right decision. You see your friends in civilian institutions having fun, wearing normal clothes and going out on the weekend. At the academy, you don't have any privileges your freshman year. It made me look inward and think about what I really wanted. I attended the Air Force Academy because I wanted to make the world a better place in some capacity. I realized early on that I don't have that realm of influence. At the Air Force, I focus on five people who are within my sphere of influence. If I can make their lives better, then I feel like I made the world a better place. I have three younger siblings who are about to go through the college selection process. We put a lot of pressure on people that their college decision will change their life. And it's just not true. If you don't like your college, you're never stuck. You should have faith in your abilities. In retrospect, life appears very linear. But it's never actually that way. We all try little things along the way. Some things stick, and some things don't. Nobody really has it figured out. We all just pretend.

Some Are Scanning for Hints of Trouble: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Our reporter took a five-mile walk around Manhattan to find businesses that are using facial recognition technology.
In early February, I spent $ 171.59 to see the Rangers play the Canucks at Madison Square Garden. I had no plans to watch the hockey game. I just wanted to find out whether my guest, Tia Garcia, a personal injury lawyer, could get into the building.
We got in the security line and walked through the metal detector. Then, as Ms. Garcia turned to pick up her bag from the conveyor belt, a security guard asked her to step aside and show her driver's license. "Am I in trouble?" she asked.
The guard told her that she would need to wait for management to come speak to her.
He didn't explain why, but we already knew: Ms. Garcia is one of thousands of lawyers on a ban list because their firms are involved in litigation against the arena's parent company. While we were in line, facial recognition technology identified her.
"Have you been here before?" the guard asked. When Ms. Garcia told him that she had seen the Cavaliers play the Knicks a few weeks earlier, he expressed surprise. That time, Ms. Garcia had worn a medical mask, a hat and glasses. This time, her face was clearly visible.
Five minutes later, the security manager arrived to officially kick Ms. Garcia out. Even though she had expected it to happen, Ms. Garcia found the deployment of facial recognition technology to punish corporate enemies alarming. So did local lawmakers. The City Council convened a hearing last month to discuss how Madison Square Garden and other local businesses were using the technology.
There were lots of questions to be asked: Who is using it? Who are the people they're trying to keep out of their businesses? What do they do when the technology gets it wrong and flags a look-alike? Mayor Eric Adams had recently encouraged businesses to use facial recognition to fight shoplifting. Who answered his call? If you shoplift once, are you barred for life?
But the Council had a problem. Madison Square Garden hadn't sent a representative, as requested. (A spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden said the organization thought its view -- that the technology provides a safe and secure environment -- was represented by others there.)
And no one at the hearing knew which other businesses were using the technology.
So I decided to find out. New York City has a quirky new law that makes it the only municipality in the country where a business scanning faces has to post a sign telling customers that it is doing so. After I left the meeting, I set off on a miles-long walk in search of those signs. They weren't where I expected them to be.
A Privacy Walkabout
I left the hearing in Lower Manhattan and walked south, past the clothing retailer Zara and a CVS. Neither had a "biometric identifier information" disclosure, so presumably they weren't using facial recognition technology.
"Biometric identifiers? What's that?" an employee at the CVS door asked when I told him about the sign I was seeking. "Biometric identifier" is a fancy term for a unique physical trait, such as a fingerprint, a voiceprint or a scan of someone's face.
Facial recognition software is typically trained on photos of millions of people, until it learns what to look for in an image to match one face to another. It is not perfect, but has grown more accurate in recent years thanks to advances in artificial intelligence.
Typically, a store using facial recognition technology isn't trying to identify every customer who walks through the door but rather is looking for faces that have been put on a watch list, such as previous shoplifters. Madison Square Garden has said it created its lawyer watch list by collecting faces from the barred firms' websites.
I walked a few more blocks south to what I thought would be a sure bet for such a sign: Amazon Go, a convenience store where customers can pay with a palm print. The store was awash in cameras, sensors and palm scanners, allowing shoppers to pick up items and simply walk out without needing to stop at a register. There was a prominent display about the "power in your palm," with instructions on how to link one's handprint to an Amazon account.
But even this store did not have what I was looking for. Amazon said that facial recognition technology wasn't used and that it collected biometrics only from people who volunteered their palms. I bought some mediocre sushi and some water, but with a code from my Amazon app, as I wasn't quite ready to give Jeff Bezos my handprint.
Only the human kind used here
I made my way north toward the New York Times building in Midtown Manhattan, crossing Canal Street to walk along the distinctive cobblestone streets of SoHo. I popped into a Ralph Lauren where a blue cotton blazer was $ 790, a Sunglass Hut selling Gucci glasses for $ 550 and a Louis Vuitton with a $ 990 sleeveless crop top. None of them had a biometric sign, only many employees who watched me closely.
At Coach, a greeter standing next to high-end purses said that the store didn't use facial recognition technology, but that he and his fellow employees knew the regular shoplifters by face and would crowd the door when they tried to enter.
"Try Sephora," he suggested. I did, but there was no sign there. Nor at the Apple, Target or Adidas stores nearby.
The Pew Research Center recently surveyed Americans about their views on facial recognition technology, but only its use by the police, which slightly fewer than half called a good idea. The New York City Police Department has been using the technology since 2011. Less is known about its use by the private sector beyond Madison Square Garden, which started using its system in 2018 to identify security threats.
I walked up the Avenue of the Americas toward Chelsea, passing Old Navy, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Trader Joe's and Best Buy. None of them had a biometric disclosure sign.
The city law that requires the notice went into effect last year. The penalty for failure to post a sign is $ 500, but the law also prohibits businesses from selling or sharing the biometric information they collect, with damages of up to $ 5,000 per violation. Private individuals are responsible for enforcing the law; consumers would need to figure out that a business without a sign was secretly scanning their faces or sharing their faceprints with others, and then sue.
"We suspect many businesses are still unaware of the N.Y.C. biometrics law," said Mark Francis, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight who focuses on data privacy.
'Stop grocery store violence and theft'
As I crossed 25th Street, and the pedometer on my iPhone hit nearly 14,000 steps, I finally spotted a sign at the gourmet grocer Fairway Market. A flimsy white piece of paper, titled "Biometric Identifier Information Disclosure," was taped to a sliding-glass door.
"They use it for security, if people steal," a Fairway employee told me. The store, he said, used a vendor called FaceFirst; its website promises to "stop grocery store violence and theft." The employee, who asked not to be identified by name because he wasn't authorized to speak to a reporter, said a man had been kicked out just that morning because he had previously stolen coffee.
Retail theft has been on the rise since the pandemic. Karen O'Shea, a spokeswoman for Wakefern, Fairway's parent company, said the facial recognition system was put in place about a year ago.
"Retail theft and shoplifting has a high rate of repeat offense and drives up grocery costs for all customers," she said. "Only trained asset protection associates use the system, which helps us focus attention on repeat shoplifters."
After leaving Fairway, I ran into more signs just eight blocks away. When I walked into Macy's on 34th Street, two fancy white signs were affixed to the gray marble wall, one in English and one in Spanish, informing customers that their "biometric identifier information" was collected for "asset protection purposes."
A security guard said he didn't know whether facial recognition was used there. "What signs? Where?" he said, looking around, seemingly confused.
Macy's did not respond to requests for comment about the signs, but a spokesperson previously told Insider that the company used facial recognition "in a small subset of stores with high incidences of organized retail theft and repeat offenders."
Help!
Macy's was just a block from Madison Square Garden, so I swung by to confirm its signs were still on display on poles near the metal detectors. The last six blocks of my trek, past restaurants and retailers on Eighth Avenue, had no obvious biometric signage.
The findings from my four-hour walkabout were confounding. I had checked dozens of stores. The high-end retailers of SoHo apparently weren't using the cutting-edge technology to protect their expensive apparel, but Fairway Market, with lemons on sale for 99 cents, was. Either we are in the early days of the technology's deployment or it is not proving as popular with retailers as expected.
My journey was a limited survey of a vast city of many blocks. Walking the whole of it would take something like six years. So, dear reader, I request help. If you are wandering the streets of New York City and spot a biometric identifier information disclosure sign, I invite you to take a photograph, record the location and send it to me at kashmir.hill@nytimes.com. My feet thank you.

Designers Create Small Acts of Resistance: [Style Desk]

Full text: A year after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, four figures from the Kyiv fashion scene reflect on a year of personal and professional survival.
It has been 12 months since Russia began a brutal invasion of Ukraine, forcing millions to flee the country and devastating the local economy, including the budding Kyiv fashion scene.
The war is the reason that Ukraine Fashion Week came to London this season, with three designers -- Ivan Frolov, Ksenia Schnaider and Julie Paskal -- presenting new fall collections on Feb. 21, the final day of shows at London Fashion Week.
All of Ukraine's fashion brand founders have faced numerous difficulties: deciding whether to leave their country or stay behind while under near constant attack; keeping their businesses afloat from a new city; and creating beauty in the face of such uncertainty.
Here, four Ukrainian fashion designers share their stories of Feb. 24, 2022, and the months that followed. For them, continuing their creative work is not just a way of life -- it is an act of resistance.
Ivan Frolov is the creative director of the women's wear brand Frolov, which he founded in 2015. He has created looks for Dua Lipa, Gwen Stefani and Sam Smith, among others.
A few days before the war began, I gave an interview to Women's Wear Daily. I told them that there was no way that the Russians would invade Ukraine. But at 5 a.m. on Feb. 24, bombs began falling around my apartment in central Kyiv. Friends from around the world started calling to check that I was alive. I found my mother and drove her for 30 hours to the west of the country, sending Telegram messages to my team, telling them to do whatever they could to stay safe.
After a few weeks, we started sending messages so that we could take part in the war effort, and I returned home. We're experts in constructing corsets and bras and evening gowns. Instead, when our production lines started again, we were making uniforms, bulletproof vests and rocket and grenade holders.
I had many offers to help me move abroad. But, in the end, I knew I had to remain in Kyiv. For me, personally, to be a Ukrainian fashion brand meant I had to stay in Ukraine. Only four of my team left, primarily because they had kids. Everyone else has stayed -- around 35 people -- and they need money to survive. If anything, we have hired more people because we have brought on freelancers to do embroidery work.
I am proud of all we do. Though if I'm honest, there are more difficult moments than good ones. My brand has always been about sex and sexuality and celebration, but it is hard in war to sew sparkles on party outfits when rockets are flying overhead and the walls keep shaking around you. The mental challenges, the sense of guilt about what we are doing, can be enormous.
But there is sometimes joy. In January, I was making my way from Kyiv to Paris for couture. It involves a special permit, 24 hours via trains to Poland and then a very long bus ride from Warsaw. So I was standing alone at a snowy Polish bus station, trying to manhandle three suitcases of clothes and feeling so cold when my phone rang. Had I seen the news? Beyoncé was wearing a hot pink Frolov minidress covered in Swarovski crystals that I had designed as her finale look for a huge hotel opening in Dubai. The moment had gone viral online. Surreal doesn't even cover it. I cried.
Before the war, something like that had been my ultimate dream. Now I have another. Victory for Ukraine.
Ksenia Schnaider is the creative director of KseniaSchnaider, which is best known for its upcycled denim collections. She started the line with her husband, Anton, in 2011.
I used to live near Kyiv airport, so on the morning of Feb. 24, I woke at dawn to the sound of massive explosions. I didn't leave my apartment that day. I just looked out the window and watched bombs go off and hundreds of people running with suitcases. I just couldn't believe that what I saw was real. The next day, my husband, daughter, some friends and their dog -- and me -- piled into a car and drove 20 hours to western Ukraine. It was bumper-to-bumper traffic the whole way, and for the next weeks we slept on a different sofa in a different house every night. Eventually, because of my child, I made the decision to leave, and we traveled to Budapest.
For a while, I felt like I could never design again and that I'd lost my brand. My team were scattered all over the world, our headquarters in Kyiv were now dangerous and we had left a season of clothes orders there, unshipped, that never made it to retailers. I divided all the money we had left in the company account to our employees.
But in the spring, my team started reaching out again. Most have husbands in the army, and they need to feed their children. We asked international partners if we could produce some of our best-selling designs, albeit at a small scale. Amazingly, some of our deadstock suppliers in eastern Ukraine were still working, so we could source fabrics. I also did a collaboration with a New York denim brand, DL1961.
In the summer, after months of zero sales, people in Ukraine started buying again. Zara and other foreign brands had all left. But then came fall and the blackouts, and shelling began again.
In September, we moved to Britain as part of a rehousing scheme called Homes for Ukraine. We now live in the guesthouse of a British family's home in Sussex. I've been back to Ukraine three times since the war started, but I often feel guilty for not being there. Showing at London Fashion Week feels like a ray of hope and a chance to create new designs again. It is a chance to make sure the world remembers the vibrant Ukrainian fashion industry that existed before last year.
Julie Pelipas is a former fashion director of Vogue Ukraine and the founder of Bettter , which produces upcycled tailored collections from deadstock clothes. Ms. Pelipas is a semifinalist for the 2023 LVMH Prize for young fashion designers.
Everyone told me I was being foolish, but I had a very strong premonition in February last year that I had to leave Ukraine. I put four seasons of clothes in a suitcase and took my children to stay with my mother, who lives in Greece. For weeks, people just kept saying "Come home," so I booked flights home. They were for Feb. 24, which proved to be the day the tanks rolled in.
I think I was fearful, because I had already seen what could happen. My apartment is in the center of the city, and during the 2014 revolution, I saw people dying on the streets as I breastfed my baby at the window. I didn't want my kids to see that, too. I am from Mariupol, which became one of the most bombarded cities of the war. Some of my family survived, some died. It has honestly been hell on earth.
Last March, I went to Paris for some fashion week shows, simply so I could try to rally the industry and see what it might do to help us. People listened, but I could tell they had no idea of the reality that was taking place on their doorsteps, right at that very moment. That's why I extended Bettter to become a community project as well as a fashion brand, so that there was a simple system in place to help our fashion industry.
I approached LVMH and Kering for help. As an ex-Vogue Ukraine fashion director, I knew all of the local Ukrainian designers. My team worked on this, rather than our brand, for months.
For three months in the summer, we returned to Kyiv and worked on our brand again. OK, we had to go to air-raid shelters or the Metro station every two hours, and there are curfews, but we did it. But then things got worse. Close friends died in attacks. Warehouses full of clothes were burned to the ground. I felt such a sense of responsibility to continue, but not if people were dying because I was keeping them there. So now I am trying to move my team to London, to start our operations there.
I think the wider fashion industry does care but doesn't always react with responsibility. It is hard to see Russians at fashion week, for example. Notoriously pro-Putin influencers or front row figures who we know are part of the regime. Where are the Ukrainians? It is very disappointing.
I feel that my mission now is to make sure the world does not see Ukrainians as victims, but as fighters. We are so resilient, we are hard workers, we want to thrive -- and that is true of our fashion scene, which is so creative and bursting with talent.
Ruslan Baginskiy is the co-founder of a hat label of the same name, which he started with Petro Yasinsky in 2014. Inspired by Ukrainian culture and headwear, the hats have been worn by Bella Hadid, Madonna and Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska.
After Feb. 24, there was one question in our minds: to stay or go. We knew we didn't want to leave Ukraine and had to support our economy. So in the end, we relocated our business -- and 100-person staff -- to Lviv, my hometown, near Poland. We feel like one big family now, because we also hired some of our employees' mums and husbands.
Before last February, we were in 250 stores all over the world. Partners have been supportive, but, of course, it is much harder now. We also opened two stores here -- one in Lviv and one in the Carpathian Mountains, which was like Ukraine's Aspen before the war. It might seem crazy to some people, and, of course, the domestic market here is very volatile. But it's also about survival and leading by example and showing that we need some of the dreams we had before to turn into reality now. Plus, come winter or summer, people need hats.
We still have global ambitions, but for now, we find happiness in other ways. Our hats were featured in the latest season of "The White Lotus," on Harper, Portia and Daphne. We also made a hat for Queen Elizabeth II last year, which she wore before she died.
You need those moments. The west of the country is safer, but two months ago, a bomb exploded in front of my grandma's house. Rockets still come and destroy our infrastructure, the power cuts out constantly, you sit for hours in dark shelters. It makes it hard to keep going. But we do. Because we want to show the world what "Made in Ukraine" means.

It has been 12 months since Russia began a brutal invasion of Ukraine, forcing millions to flee the country and devastating the local economy, including the budding fashion scene in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv.
The war is the reason that Ukraine Fashion Week came to London this season, with three designers — Ivan Frolov, Ksenia Schnaider and Julie Paskal — presenting new fall collections Feb. 21, the final day of shows at London Fashion Week.
All of Ukraine’s fashion brand founders have faced numerous difficulties: deciding whether to leave their country or stay behind while under near constant attack; keeping their businesses afloat from a new city; and creating beauty in the face of such uncertainty.
Here, four Ukrainian fashion designers share their stories of Feb. 24, 2022, and the months that followed. For them, continuing their creative work is not just a way of life — it is an act of resistance. The interviews were condensed and edited for clarity.
Ivan Frolov is the creative director of the womenswear brand Frolov, which he founded in 2015. He has created looks for Dua Lipa, Gwen Stefani and Sam Smith, among others.
A few days before the war began, I gave an interview to Women’s Wear Daily. I told them that there was no way that the Russians would invade Ukraine. But at 5 a.m. on Feb. 24, bombs began falling around my apartment in central Kyiv. Friends from around the world started calling to check that I was alive. I found my mother and drove her for 30 hours to the west of the country, sending Telegram messages to my team, telling them to do whatever they could to stay safe.
After a few weeks, we started sending messages so that we could take part in the war effort, and I returned home. We’re experts in constructing corsets and bras and evening gowns. Instead, when our production lines started again, we were making uniforms, bulletproof vests and rocket and grenade holders.
I had many offers to help me move abroad. But, in the end, I knew I had to remain in Kyiv. For me, personally, to be a Ukrainian fashion brand meant I had to stay in Ukraine. Only four of my team left, primarily because they had kids. Everyone else has stayed — around 35 people — and they need money to survive. If anything, we have hired more people because we have brought on freelancers to do embroidery work.
I am proud of all we do. Though if I’m honest, there are more difficult moments than good ones. My brand has always been about sex and sexuality and celebration, but it is hard in war to sew sparkles on party outfits when rockets are flying overhead and the walls keep shaking around you. The mental challenges, the sense of guilt about what we are doing, can be enormous.
But there is sometimes joy. In January, I was making my way from Kyiv to Paris for couture. It involves a special permit, 24 hours via trains to Poland and then a very long bus ride from Warsaw. So I was standing alone at a snowy Polish bus station, trying to manhandle three suitcases of clothes and feeling so cold when my phone rang. Had I seen the news?

Full text: This article is part of a series examining Responsible Fashion , and innovative efforts to address issues facing the fashion industry.
Who gets to decide what is green or greenwashing? Is it a good thing that more celebrities and reality stars are embracing pre-loved clothing? How much should governments step in when it comes to sustainability? What protections do garment workers have?
These are just some of the questions that dominated the debate in 2022 about how the fashion industry can reduce its impact on the planet and safeguard its hundreds of thousands of workers in poor countries.
Going into 2023, there are soaring energy prices in Europe, global supply chain disruptions and spikes in the cost of living in many parts of the world. These factors are all expected to pose challenges for an industry under pressure from regulators and consumers to find meaningful solutions -- fast.
Here are some of the most memorable moments when it came to responsible fashion in 2022.
Shein Continued Its Fast-Fashion Dominance
A lot of people don't know how to pronounce Shein (it's "she-in"), the Chinese fast-fashion behemoth, but chances are they've probably heard of it, shopped for its clothes or perhaps even boycotted it.
Shein grabbed plenty of headlines in 2022: There were labor violation investigations and allegations of elevated levels of lead in some products. At the Copenhagen Fashion Summit in June, Shein pledged $ 15 million over three years to the Or Foundation, a charity working at Kantamanto, the world's largest secondhand clothing market, in Accra, Ghana. The pledge prompted suggestions of greenwashing as the company continued to make a fortune from sales of supercheap clothes.
It's hard to tell whether these negative reports have affected the company. According to research compiled by Money.co.uk and published in December, Shein was the world's most popular fashion brand this year. After analyzing a year's worth of search data on Google, Shein topped the list of most-searched-for brands in 113 countries in the world, beating Zara to the top spot.
The Founder of Patagonia Gave Away His Company to Fight Climate Change
Patagonia has long positioned itself as a brand at the forefront of the war against climate change, giving away 1 percent of its sales to environmental causes since 1985. But this year, the outdoor clothing retailer's founder, Yvon Chouinard, took a bold step: He gave his company away.
He, his wife and children handed Patagonia to a nonprofit group, designed to ensure that all of the company's profits -- some $ 100 million a year -- are used to fund conservation efforts around the globe. While it is a move that, according to Bloomberg, will allow the Chouinard family to avoid a substantial tax hit, it also may set a precedent for fashion's numerous other mega-rich dynasties.
Stars Did a Different Kind of Turn on the Red Carpet
In 2022, the message spread that for the fashion industry to reduce its environmental footprint, more brands will need to incorporate repair, resale and rental services into their business models. Spurred by the rise in popularity of rental clothing, which has already been embraced by influencers, a handful of megawatt stars also began renting high fashion for red-carpet appearances. The most notable outing this year? A turn earlier this month by the Princess of Wales, who wore a Kermit green off-the-shoulder frock by Emilia Wickstead to the Earthshot Prize Awards ceremony in Boston, that she rented for £74, about $ 90, from the British website Hurr.
Big Questions About How Fashion Measures Progress
The Sustainable Apparel Coalition has been one of fashion's most powerful sustainability-focused trade groups. Its tools, known as the Higg Index, are used by companies including Walmart, Nike and H&M Group, and were seen as a de facto industry standard to measure environmental and social impact. Until it wasn't.
Regulators in Norway said this spring that Higg data was not sufficient for environmental marketing claims. A Quartz investigation found H&M's environmental scores were "misleading" and "outright deceptive." And a New York Times article said the index strongly favored synthetic materials made from fossil fuels over natural ones like cotton or leather.
Fueled by other controversies such as the fraudulent auditing of organic cotton in India, the debate over how fashion can create a standardized way to measure and substantiate sustainability claims by companies is only getting more heated, with no clear solution in sight.
New Laws Aimed at Fixing the Fashion Industry
This year many governments seemed to wake up to the fact that companies are not reforming themselves at a pace and scale that will meaningfully combat climate change. In January, organizers of the Fashion Act introduced a bill that, if passed, would make New York the first state in the country to pass legislation that would set broad sustainability regulations.
In May, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced the federal FABRIC Act, aiming to introduce better labor protections for U.S. garment workers as well as manufacturing incentives. In November, the European Commission proposed new rules to reduce packaging waste that would affect things like perfume bottles and e-commerce packaging.
Beefing up government oversight may be a messy and slow process, but its start has climate advocates encouraged.
A Changing Relationship Between Fast Fashion and Reality TV
The symbiotic relationship between reality television shows and fast fashion brands like Fashion Nova, Shein and Boohoo is well established. But in May, "Love Island," the hit British reality dating show that has turned scores of contestants into influencers, embraced a new sponsor, eBay UK.
For several years, "Love Island" contestants wore the fast-fashion brand I Saw It First, which sells clothes for as little as $ 3. But this season, contestants wore pre-loved clothes and accessories to promote responsible shopping.
In September, the internet went into a sharp-tongued uproar when Kourtney Kardashian Barker was unveiled by Boohoo as its latest collaborator and sustainability ambassador. But, overall, there seems to be more scrutiny about how reality TV and fast fashion are both peddling a false egalitarianism, or a way for everyday people to embody aspirational lifestyles.
New Materials and Manufacturing Processes
The fashion industry is still heavily reliant on fossil-fuel-based fabrics and materials. A December report by the environmental lobbying group Changing Markets Foundation found that brands continue to mask a dependence on synthetics under the guise of increasing their commitment to sustainable materials.
Still, while invention should not be overly prioritized over implementation, which is what really guarantees change, a number of innovations drew attention this year that have the potential to change some fashion manufacturing processes. A new textile recycling plant in Sweden, run by Renewcell, which creates a material called Circulose from cotton waste, said it has reached its full production capacity after signing deals with brands like H&M and Zara.
Stella McCartney, who invested in Mylo, a mycelium material produced by Bolt Threads, as part of a 2020 consortium including Kering, Adidas and Lululemon, introduced a new venture with Protein Evolution that will process leftover mixed nylon and polyesters into new material for use in new clothing. And innovative textiles like seaweed fabric, mushroom leather and pea silk have also been gaining momentum, as well as Spinnova, a natural fiber that is compostable and recyclable and made without water or any harmful chemicals.
Garment Workers Stood Up for Their Rights
Fashion brands rarely own the factories that make their clothes. The vast majority of garment and footwear orders are outsourced to suppliers in emerging markets, where overhead is cheap and the cost of human labor is even cheaper. In 2022, hundreds of thousands of garment workers, who power the global clothing trade, took to the streets to protest wages and working conditions as inflation and canceled orders took a toll. In Haiti, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan, many used social media to alert the world to their cause.
The news in December that factory workers in Pakistan would now be protected under the International Accord, a legally enforceable health and safety agreement, was a significant step. But the furor at the start of the World Cup over the mistreatment of thousands of workers making soccer uniforms for the likes of Adidas and Nike was another stark reminder that there remains a long way to go.

Full text: Anand Goyal and Sabrina Pervez began their relationship as teenagers attending nearby high schools, but it always felt serious to both of them.
Anand Goyal and Sabrina Zara Pervez met as teenagers, or so they first thought.
Mr. Goyal attended an all-boys high school in Chelmsford, England; Ms. Pervez went to an all-girls school directly across the street. The students often intermingled, before and after each day, or when the schools hosted joint events like Valentine's Day dances and proms.
A friendship developed between Mr. Goyal and Ms. Pervez, with the two getting to know each other in person, as well with lengthy conversations over a chat app. In October 2010, they had their first date. Ms. Pervez and a group of her friends went out to a movie. Mr. Goyal came along.
"After the movie, Anand basically asked me to be his girlfriend," Ms. Pervez said. "We've been together ever since."
The qualities that endeared them to one another as teenagers remain prevalent in their relationship today.
"She was always up for things, quite adventurous, quite outgoing," said Mr. Goyal,
Ms. Pervez was drawn to Mr. Goyal's kindness and love for his family.
"Some teens go through a stage where they don't want to be with family," Ms. Pervez said. "He always made it clear he loved his family."
Even though their relationship began when they were teenagers, it always felt serious. When he was 16, Mr. Goyal told Ms. Pervez he hoped to marry her one day.
A few months after they began dating, the couple learned that they had already crossed paths more than a decade earlier.
On a car ride with her mother, Ms. Pervez asked about friends she had back in nursery school, which she attended in a different town from the one they currently lived in. Her mother mentioned that there had been another Indian boy in her class. When Ms. Pervez shared this information with Mr. Goyal, he told her that he remembered an Indian girl from his own nursery school with the same name as Ms. Pervez. The name was indelible, he said, because his older cousins used to tease him about having a girlfriend named Sabrina.
Mr. Goyal dug out some photographs from a childhood birthday party. In one of them, an image of Mr. Goyal blowing out the candles on his cake, half of the face of a young girl is visible. Ms. Pervez recognized herself immediately. They had, in fact, been classmates as toddlers.
The couple uncovered other interesting connections: They were born in the same hospital just four days apart. And they each had to take their driver's test four times before passing.
After high school, Mr. Goyal and Ms. Pervez went to colleges in different cities but continued their relationship. Mr. Goyal graduated with a first class honors degree in physics with astrophysics from the University of York in England. Ms. Pervez graduated with an honors bachelor of laws degree from Durham University, also in England. She also has a master's degree in law, business and management from the University of Law in London.
Mr. Goyal, 28, is currently studying for a physics post graduate certificate in education at Homerton College, University of Cambridge. He previously worked at Deloitte as a tax consultant in London. Ms. Pervez, also 28, a lawyer, is a director at the legal tech company, Ontra, based in London.
In 2021, the pair bought a house in Shenfield, Essex, just outside London. That same year, Mr. Goyal concocted a plan to propose.
They took a trip to New York City in December 2021. It was their first time visiting the city together. The couple are avid travelers and regimented schedules are part of every vacation. To throw Ms. Pervez off the scent of an impending proposal, Mr. Goyal created a fake itinerary of that day's plans, which included dinner and a trip to the Empire State Building.
That evening, Mr. Goyal made what Ms. Pervez thought was an impromptu suggestion to visit Central Park. Ms. Pervez wasn't sure if they had the time to spare. Mr. Goyal convinced her they did. They took a carriage ride across the park's Bow Bridge. Afterward, Mr. Goyal asked Ms. Pervez to look out over the water so he could take a picture. When she turned around, Mr. Goyal was on one knee, ring in hand.
The couple were married Dec. 16, 2022, at Cliveden House, a hotel in Buckinghamshire, England on the border with Berkshire. It was a small ceremony with 13 guests: their parents, grandparents and siblings. Anna Benjamin, a registrar from Buckinghamshire Council authorized to register marriages, officiated.
Mr. Goyal and Ms. Pervez are planning a bigger wedding celebration next year in Greece, but they said that their intimate gathering was an emotional culmination of the last 12 years.
"We've been together so long, our families very much feel like each other's families," Ms. Pervez said. "Having that chance to celebrate our love at the wedding was very special."
